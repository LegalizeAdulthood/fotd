; FOTD -- May 03, 2013 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image resembles a shield decorated by fractal heraldry.  
; I appropriately named it "Well Shielded".  The fractal, which is 
; rotated 90 degrees, lies on the main stem of its parent, an 
; oversized Mandelbrot set that is on its way to becoming a cubic 
; Mandeloid.  The exact location of the scene is in a blunt valley 
; jutting eastward into the second bud out the main spike, which 
; is already splitting into the cubic-bud shape, with two lobes.
; 
; The rating of an 8 is based on the unusual cubic shield-like 
; pattern and also on my semi-expert coloring, which some say is 
; great and others say is amateurish.  All I can say is that great 
; art is not created in the matter of the minutes that I spent on 
; today's image.
; 
; I went back to the 'DivideBrot5' formula for today's image 
; because this formula does some types of mixed-power images 
; better than the 'FinDivBrot-2' formula that I usually use.
; 
; The calculation time of 2 minutes might be just slow enough to 
; give restlessness a chance to appear.  The wiser way to see the 
; finished image is to visit the FOTD web sites.
; 
; Find your happiness at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the image is posted already calculated.
; 
; And clarify your vision at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; where the high-definition versions are posted.
; 
; The thousands of back images are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; bringing joy beyond comprehension to those who venture there.
; 
; Perfect weather still prevailed here at Fractal Central today, 
; with a cloudless sky, gentle breeze and temperature of 70F 21C.  
; The fractal cat took it in stride, being more concerned with 
; pigeons roosting in the area.  The humans had an average day, 
; which is pleasant to experience but boring to write about.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted quite soon, and that is not boring. 
; Until soon arrives, take care, and we should not be angry at big 
; corporations such as oil and phone companies for making such 
; obscene profits at our expense.  We should be angry at ourselves 
; for having allowed ourselves to become addicted to their flashy 
; products, thereby assuring these powerful conglomerates that 
; their obscene profits will continue to grow.
