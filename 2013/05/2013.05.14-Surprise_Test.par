; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- May 13, 2013 (Rating M-7,A-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The discussion is brief because the day was very busy.
; 
; Today's image shows a tiny minibrot in the East Valley area of a 
; larger but still small minibrot on the main stem of the 
; Mandelbrot set.  The minibrot has been almost totally filled in 
; by hyper-stuff, with the only remaining open area a black dot at 
; the center of the main bay.
; 
; The math value is down 2 points from yesterday's, since the 
; effect is not as surprising as the title would imply.  The 
; artistic worth is up a point however, due to the extra effort I 
; hurriedly put into the coloring.
; 
; The name "Surprise Test" is an exaggeration.  I was really not 
; very surprised when I saw the image
; 
; The calculation time of a mere 30 seconds will make all fractal 
; troubles vanish like a black cat on a dark night.
; 
; See the light!  Enjoy the finished image posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Thrill in the hi-def version at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And if today's image leaves you hungry for more, check the 
; thousands of FOTD back FOTD fractals and hair-raising 
; discussions online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A definite chill was in the air here at Fractal Central today, 
; with a mix of sun and clouds and a temperature of 52F 11C.  The 
; low tonight is forecast to be 27, which could be the lowest ever 
; recorded in May.  No wonder the local farmers are worried.  The 
; fractal cat is not worried however.  An extra treat of tuna kept 
; him happy most all day.  The fractal people made it through a 
; very busy day with a minimum of distractions.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted, tomorrow if all goes well, the 
; next day if it does not.  Until whenever take care, and where is 
; the outrage about the bombing in Afghanistan and the 19 people 
; shot at the parade in New Orleans?  I guess people get outraged 
; only when the news media jumps on a story, thereby telling the 
; public, (Are we a flock of such easily manipulated sheep?) that 
; it's time to be angry again.
