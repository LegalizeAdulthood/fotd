; FOTD -- May 06, 2013 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies very deep in the parent fractal that comes 
; about when 0.1 part of Z^(4.4) is combined with 2 parts of 
; Z^(0.4) and straight C is added on each iteration.  This parent 
; resembles a Mandelbrot set facing northeast with a large 
; triangular area sprouting behind it from its East Valley area.  
; Today's scene is located in the northwest valley forming the 
; entrance to this triangular area.
; 
; The name "In Deep Territory" refers to the unusual magnitude of 
; the image, one of the greatest of all time.
; 
; The rating of an 8 reflects my opinion of the image at the time 
; I rated it.  I may soon shift to an more informative rating 
; system that gives two ratings, one for the artistic value, the 
; other for the mathematical interest.
; 
; A good part of the artistic effect was achieved by rendering the 
; image with the inside set to 'fmod'.  The magnitude of over 
; 2.5*(10^13) is at the verge of resolution breakdown.  In fact, 
; the breakdown is already becoming visible along some of the 
; sharp edges.
; 
; Luckily, the image calculates in 3-1/2 minutes, surprisingly 
; fast for a scene that uses the 'fmod' feature.  And the web 
; sites are always there for instant enjoyment.
; 
; Check the finished image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and the high-definition renderings at:

;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Another absolutely perfect day prevailed here at Fractal Central 
; today.  The few angel-hair cirrus clouds that appeared in the 
; morning, and the few cotton-puff cumulus clouds that popped up 
; over the ridges in the afternoon did nothing but add to the 
; perfection.  The temperature of 73F 23C and gentle southeast 
; wind were also perfect.  The fractal cat admired the outdoor 
; conditions . . . from the inside.  The fractal humans also 
; admired the outdoor conditions.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a number of hours.  Until that 
; number passes, take care, and I am still waiting for someone to 
; solve the very interesting and quite puzzling 'Boltzmann brain' 
; paradox, which currently has physicists pondering and rational 
; skeptics a bit concerned also.  I'll forget the convoluted line 
; of thought about entropy that led to the problem, since it is on 
; the internet.  At this time, I'll merely state that either the 
; existence of the universe involves more than pure blind chance, 
; or the universe is filled with disembodied 'Boltzmann brains' 
; which somehow can exist and be conscious while floating in empty 
; space.
; 
; The apparently 'logical' deduction is that, if the universe is 
; merely a random accident, then it is many googols of times more 
; likely that, instead of existing in a real physical universe, I 
; am a pathetic deluded Boltzmann brain, floating in empty space 
; and imagining everything I have ever experienced, including the 
; physical world and everything else that appears to be so real.  
; I doubt that this is true, but, despite convoluted claims to the 
; contrary, no one has yet been able to show beyond doubt that it 
; is untrue without invoking an intelligence of some kind to elimi-
; nate the random element.  And we know what rational scientific 
; skeptics think of the idea of 'God'.
