; FOTD -- May 01, 2013 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image reminds me of bigfoot footprints.  Bigfoots (not 
; 'bigfeet') are also known as sasquatches, so I named today's 
; image "Sasquatch Bigfoots".  These enigmatic creatures cannot 
; possibly exist.  If they did, we would long since have found 
; hard evidence of their existence such as their bodies, excrement 
; and dwelling places.  But despite the impossibility, many people 
; still claim to have seen bigfoots, and unless one is a hard core 
; devoted CSICOP-type skeptic, it is hard to believe that every 
; one of these people are mistaken or lying.
; 
; Today's image gives proof that bigfoots are lurking around FC.  
; I mixed 1/10 part of Z^2 with one part of Z^(-1000) and found 
; the proof I was not really searching for.  This unlikely 
; combination of parameters produced an oversized parent fractal 
; that appears to be a Mandelbrot set with flat disks filling the 
; smaller buds and floating in the center of the larger buds as 
; well as the main bay.
; 
; The situation looked rather hopeless at first, but knowing how 
; tricky fractals can be, I checked Seahorse Valley of the large 
; minibrot on the main stem of the parent, where two disks are 
; tangent, and found an interesting area of chaos.  This area is 
; where the bigfoots thrive, and it took little additional time to 
; find the evidence.
; 
; If I had found an actual bigfoot, I might have rated the image 
; at a 10.  As it is, with only the mysterious footprints to show, 
; I could give a rating no higher than 7-1/2.
; 
; Perhaps the best feature of the image is its starship speed of 
; 20 seconds.  But be warned, when calculated at faster-than-light 
; warp speed, the image finishes before it is started.  So be sure 
; to avoid the time paradox that would result if you failed to 
; start the calculation after the image had appeared on the 
; screen.  Or better still, forget such time-travel paradoxes by 
; checking the image on one of the web sites.
; 
; Be happy in your fractal work by viewing the finished image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and check the glories of high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; More FOTD back images than one can shake a stick at are posted 
; at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; After viewing the back images, forget about shaking the stick.  
; You'll be too exhausted to lift it.
; 
; The weather was absolutely perfect here at Fractal Central 
; today.  Perfection is described by a cloudless deep blue sky, 
; pleasantly warm sun, gentle breezes, low humidity and a 
; temperature of 75F 24C.  The fractal cat took it in stride.  FL 
; spent the afternoon puttering in her garden, while I took a 
; pleasant walk to the Susquehanna River, which is 1/2 mile from 
; FC, 1/2 mile wide, and home to a variety of common eastern water 
; fowl.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear, though not by magic, in the proper 
; universal time.  Until whenever, take care, and be aware that, 
; according to relativity, there is no universal time.
