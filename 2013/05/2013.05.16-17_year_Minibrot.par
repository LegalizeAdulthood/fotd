; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- May 16, 2013 (Rating Math-7,Art-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies on the main spike of an oversized Mandelbrot 
; set that is just starting to morph into a Z^17+C Mandeloid.  The 
; first signs of transition are already visible from the surface, 
; in the finer detail.  Today's scene lies just inside the point 
; where the main spike is cut off by the escape radius.  A small 
; outzoom will show how close it lies.
; 
; The name "17-Year Minibrot" refers to the generating formula, 
; and also to the 17-year cicadas, (magiciada septemdecem), which 
; are due to emerge in the Fractal Central vicinity in a few 
; weeks.
; 
; I rendered the image with the outside set to 'tdis'.  This gave 
; the image enough detail to make it interesting.
; 
; Both the mathematical and artistic ratings are 7, which means 
; that both are somewhat above average.  The calculation time of 
; 15 seconds will probably be cut by at least half on a SOTA 
; (state of the art) machine, but the minor annoyance of setting 
; up and running this letter as a parameter file will remain.  
; This minor annoyance can be eliminated at the web sites.
; 
; Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, the image may be 
; viewed without the need of calculating it by surfing over to the 
; official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; High-definition variations are posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and scads of back images are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Really pleasant weather was appreciated as best as possible by 
; those here at Fractal Central today.  The fractal cat questioned 
; the partly cloudy skies, but approved of the temperature of 82F 
; 28C.  The fractal humans alternated between commercial work and 
; weather enjoyment.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the near future.  Until the near 
; future arrives, take care, and terrorists are said to be enemies 
; of freedom, which I guess gives us the right to over-run their 
; land and drop bombs on them.  But I fail to see how anyone could 
; be an enemy of freedom.
; 
; Would the terrorists rather be slaves than free people, or could 
; they simply be fighting back as best they can against what they 
; see as our aggressive intrusion into their sovereign territor-
; ies?  After all, some people say we must keep them suppressed if 
; we are to maintain access to the raw materials that lie in their 
; territories but that we need to maintain our comfortable but 
; extravagant life style.
