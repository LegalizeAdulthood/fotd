; 
; FOTD -- May 10, 2013 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the same area of the same parent fractal 
; that gave us yesterday's image, though it is located deeper in 
; the parent's East Valley than yesterday's.  It would have rated 
; a 9 if it had not been a virtual repeat, but the actual rating 
; of 8-1/2 is still high enough to do justice to its dark somber 
; mood.
; 
; Once again, there is no minibrot lurking at the center of the 
; image, which apparently continues down forever, with the number 
; of arms increasing in the same irregular manner.  In fact, I 
; have yet to find a single minibrot in any of the strange higher-
; dimensional parts of the HyperMandelbrot set.  This is really 
; not surprising, since HyperMinibrots would be four-dimensional 
; and unable to be squeezed onto a flat 2-D screen without huge 
; distortion.
; 
; The name "Variation" points out that the image is a variation of 
; yesterday's theme, rather than something new.
; 
; The good news is the fireball calculation time of 40 seconds, 
; which will be cut substantially if the parameter file is run on 
; one of the present-day multi-processor hot-rod units that the 
; Fractint program cannot yet (if ever) take advantage of.  The 
; not-so-secret path to total freedom from parameter-running 
; chores lies on the FOTD web sites, where fractal enlightenment 
; abounds.
; 
; The official FOTD web site, where the basic finished image is 
; posted, may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; with studies of the image in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The FOTD back fractals from April 1997 are filed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day began with dense fog here at Fractal Central.  The fog 
; lifted later in the morning, but the sun had a hard time break-
; ing through higher clouds.  We did have enough sun however to 
; raise the temperature to 73F 23C, which made the fractal cat 
; happy even from his lookout post inside FC.  The humans had one 
; more in the apparently endless string of normal days.  But this 
; does not imply boredom.  After all, who needs sensational happen-
; ings in their daily lives when there is quite enough sensation 
; coming from the mass media.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a nominal amount of time.  No 
; temporal anomaly is implied however.  Until next time, take 
; care, and mythological stories are symbols that, when properly 
; understood, describe the spiritual world; just as mathematical 
; expressions are symbols that, when properly understood, describe 
; the physical world.
