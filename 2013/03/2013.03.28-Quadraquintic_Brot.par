; FOTD -- March 28, 2013 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's long-awaited FOTD image rates a solid 8-1/2, most of 
; which is due to the coloring.  The striking colors were not a 
; result of any artistic talent.  They are a result of programmed 
; randomness, though I did give myself a 1/2 point bonus for being 
; the one who struck the <enter> key.  
; 
; The image shows a scene in a minor minibrot on the main stem of 
; the grossly oversized parent Mandelbrot set.  This minibrot is 
; halfway through the process of morphing from quadratic to 
; quintic, with today's scene located in debris on the degenerate 
; northwest shore line of the minibrot's main bay.
; 
; I named the image "Quadraquintic Brot" because the obviously 
; quintic minibrot at the center is surrounded (beyond the frame 
; edges) by purely quadratic stuff.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes will pass in a flash.  To 
; avoid being dazzled, I recommend visiting one of the web sites.
; 
; If the finished image is not already posted to:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; it soon will be.
; 
; The high-definition versions are at:

; The back images may be checked at:

;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A blustery mix of sun and clouds with a temperature of 48F +9C 
; made today a disappointing one for those impatient for spring to 
; arrive.  The fractal cat was equally disappointed with the 
; come-and-go sunshine on his shelf, and soon retired to my 
; favorite chair.  Meanwhile the humans continued working on the 
; work room.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted when the work room work is 
; finished, most likely in 24 hours.  Until whenever, take care, 
; and those who think fracking for natural gas and oil is harmful 
; to the environment should calculate the number of square miles 
; that would need to be covered with solar panels to supply an 
; equal amount of energy.  People should do the math before clamor-
; ing for solar energy!  And monstrous wind turbines not only kill 
; the birds that fly into them, they create subsonic pressure 
; waves that are disorienting to both animals and humans within a 
; half mile or so.
