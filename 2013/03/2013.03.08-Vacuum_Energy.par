; FOTD -- March 08, 2013 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is an exploration into the detail of the cap over 
; the minibrot that appeared as the 'Translateration' image of 
; March 4.  This spurious cap is rather sensitive to parameter 
; changes, most of which I have yet to check.
; 
; Today's image shows the result of one such change.  In it, I 
; increased the exponent of the real(p4) parameter 15 orders of 
; magnitude and checked the chaos the change creates in the 
; minibrot cap.
; 
; The underlying minibrot lies in the trunk of the period-34 
; elephant on the south shore line of East Valley of the 
; Mandelbrot set, but this number appears to be totally lost in 
; the image, where the topmost pattern has 8 elements and the next 
; pattern inward has 10.
; 
; I have named the image "Vacuum Energy".  The name indicates that 
; the image overlies the emptiness of the interior of a minibrot, 
; and sometimes, just as in the 'real' physical world, the nothing 
; of a fractal vacuum can be filled with quite a bit of something.
; 
; The rating of an 8 indicates both mathematical and artistic 
; value.  The color palette is a tweaking of the palette I used in 
; the March 4 image.
; 
; The calculation time of 1 minute, 25 seconds is fast enough.  Of 
; course, the web sites are even faster.
; 
; The big-time business pros will view the finished image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; But wait!  High-definition variations are at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And the back images are stacked at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A mix of sun and clouds with a temperature of 43F +6C made today 
; a typical end-of-winter day here at Fractal Central.  With all 
; the talk on the big news outlets of snow in the Northeast, one 
; would think FC was buried.  Actually, not a flake has fallen in 
; the past week and the ground is bare, with bulbs already popping 
; up in FL's garden.  The fractal cat is unconcerned with snow or 
; flower bulbs.  All he wants to do is get into the places where 
; he is not permitted, such as storage closets and the outdoors.  
; The humans, with enough to keep them busy, want little.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a number of hours.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and we will never solve our problems until 
; we fully understand them and have the courage to accept them for 
; what they are.
