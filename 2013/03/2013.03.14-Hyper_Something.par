; FOTD -- March 14, 2013 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's date is 3-14, which makes it international PI day.  In 
; two years it will be 3-14-15, which will make it an even more 
; accurate PI day.  And in three years it will be 3-14-16, which 
; is the rounded value of PI that I learned in elementary school.  
; In honor of the number PI, today's image has absolutely nothing 
; to do with 3.141592654....
; 
; In the last FOTD, I said I was finished with the hypercomplex 
; stuff for a while.  I lied.  I am becoming so fascinated with 
; the theme that I'll probably continue with it for a number of 
; days.  I will give no rating to the images because I have no 
; idea what I am dabbling in.
; 
; Today's image shows another scene that should not be there.  The 
; location is at the center of the main bud of a minibrot in an 
; elephant on the southern shore line of East Valley of the parent 
; HyperMandelbrot set.
; 
; The eighteen arms are arranged around the center in six groups 
; of three.  But the six groups are not identical, with each group 
; having its own particular arrangement of its arms.
; 
; The name "Hyper Something" indicates that the appearance of the 
; image indicates that it involves hypercomplex numbers, but at 
; the same time I have no idea what the period of the arms means.
; 
; Regardless of what is going on, the image is a pretty good one, 
; which, if I had given it a rating, would have rated an 8.
; 
; The calculation time of 40 seconds will pass quickly, leaving 
; ample time to ponder the mathematical mysteries of the image.
; 
; For even more pondering time, check the completed image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and the high-definition versions at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The FOTD back images are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today came on like a day in mid-January here at Fractal Central, 
; with biting winds, scudding clouds and a temperature only a 
; degree or two above freezing.  The fractal cat took advantage of 
; the sun while it was shining, and found comfort in my favorite 
; chair when the sun failed him.  The humans simply had another 
; day with nothing to report,
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the proper time.  Until whenever 
; that might be, take care, and now is the time for action.
