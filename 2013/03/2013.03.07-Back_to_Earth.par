; FOTD -- March 07, 2013 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The ship that in yesterday's image was sailing space has 
; foundered.  Someone has let the wind out of its solar sails.  It 
; is stuck in the intergalactic doldrums, where it will remain 
; forever, a derelict to remind us that our fondest dreams must 
; remain unfulfilled.  And despite the technophiles' optimistic 
; pronouncements, technology will never be able to match our 
; ability to dream unfulfillable dreams.
; 
; Before we will be able to venture peaceably into space, we will 
; need to solve the economic and environmental problems facing us 
; on the surface of our planet.  The rest of the world is tired of 
; seeing people in the U.S. and other advanced countries living 
; lives of luxury at their expense.  They rightfully demand part 
; of the material action.  They claim that it is time for all 
; people in all countries to enjoy lives like we in the West have 
; been living for a century or more.  The problem is that it would 
; take at least four planet earths to supply the resources for 
; this to be possible, and it would be politically impossible to 
; squander resources to venture into space until the economic 
; inequalities are solved one way or the other and we are able to 
; live in peace.
; 
; Since this is not about to happen, we're stuck on earth, where 
; we will continue to dream awesome dreams and watch them pop like 
; bubbles.  The time could never be better to turn to fractals for 
; distraction from this harsh reality.
; 
; Today's image lies in the center of the 'fan' of one of those 
; 'double negative' parent fractals.  I rated it a 7-1/2 out of 
; generosity.  Most of the color was created by the Fractint 
; program, the DOS program that will not die, and might even 
; outlive the PC it was written to run on.
; 
; The calculation time of 4-3/4 minutes is slow, but the web sites 
; are still there.
; 
; The finished image is available online at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; With hi-def variations at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and thousands of back images at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today produced a mix of clouds and sun, with more clouds than 
; sun here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cat, realizing early 
; that he would have little sun to stretch out in, spent most of 
; the day eating and sleeping, wishing he could have lived back at 
; the Old Fractal Central when it was the one and only official 
; Fractal Central and the old fractal cats (now gone) spent their 
; days outside, watching, chasing and occasionally catching birds 
; and bugs.  The humans spent the day feeling down because of what 
; we see on the declining news channels as the declining condition 
; of our culture.
; 
; As for the next FOTD, it will be posted when the time comes.  
; Until whenever, take care, and what is the evolutionary 
; advantage of the human ability to so vividly imagine so many 
; things that, because of the body's limitations, we will be 
; forever incapable of doing?
