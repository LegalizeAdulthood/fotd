; FOTD -- March 20, 2013 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image illustrates what I take to be a bud in the 
; hypercomplex Mandelbrot set.  But the bud is not perfect.  The 
; straight arms converging on the mouth of the bud show that the 
; bud is not a critical one.  In fact, I changed the starting 
; point to 0,0.3,0.3,0 to see what other slices might look like.
; 
; I doubt that the hypercomplex set has a single critical point.  
; The hyperset is actually a four-dimensional hyperslice through 
; the 8-D Julibrot.  But enough of the bud shows through the 
; converging arms to give an idea of the gothic-arch shape of the 
; four-dimensional hypercomplex buds.
; 
; I gave the image no rating since almost all its impact is in the 
; mathematical aspect, and its color leaves much that could be 
; improved.  The name "Hyperbud" describes the scene.  The 
; calculation time of 4-3/4 minutes is rather slow.  To avoid 
; delay I recommend viewing the finished image on one of the web 
; sites.

; 
; Today here at Fractal Central featured a mix of clouds and sun 
; with a few flurries of snow and a temperature of 39F +4C.  The 
; fractal cat slept through most of it, though he did come to life 
; when tuna and cheddar appeared in his dish.  The humans simply 
; had a human day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted soon.  Until soon arrives, take 
; care, and I heard on the midday news that if an asteroid were 
; ever to be spotted coming our way, our govermnemt would be ready 
; to take action.  The action would be to tell everyone to start 
; praying.
