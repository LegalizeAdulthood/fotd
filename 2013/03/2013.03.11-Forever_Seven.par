; FOTD -- March 09, 2013 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows that heptic minibrots need not always be the 
; dull high-order things one would presume.  The parent fractal is 
; an oversized Mandelbrot set that has been corrupted not very far 
; from its surface with order-7 energies.
; 
; The scene is in the East Valley area of the parent's large main-
; stem minibrot, which is already well on the way to becoming an 
; order-7 minibrot.  This minibrot's East Valley has already 
; vanished and been replaced by burgeoning order-7 lobes, which 
; are surrounded by loosely connected spirals.  These spirals 
; still abound in today's image, which lies rather deep in one of 
; the larger spirals.
; 
; The rating of an 8 is my estimate of the image's worth.  The 
; minibrot really is quite unusual.  Foe comparison, try to find 
; as interesting an order-7 minibrot in the straight Z^(7)+C 
; Mandeloid.
; 
; The name "Forever Seven" indicates that from the magnitude of 
; today's image all the way to infinity the order-7 minibrots will 
; prevail.

; 
; We had a preview of spring here at Fractal Central today when 
; the temperature reached 55F 13C and the sky was horizon-to-
; horizon blue.  The fractal cat stretched to his fullest cat 
; length in the warm sun and was as happy as a cat could be.  The 
; humans were a satisfied neutral, which is the usual condition of 
; earth-bound humans.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in about one day.  Until then, take 
; care, and how did we ever get into a situation where we must 
; have ever-higher technology if we hope to survive?  Can no one 
; see that it's a dead end?
