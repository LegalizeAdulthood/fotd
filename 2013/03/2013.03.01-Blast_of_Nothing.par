; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- February 28, 2013 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image has been granted no rating.  There is a good 
; reason.  It is not a new fractal.  It is the parent fractal of 
; the past two days' images rotated so that east is up and north 
; is left.  The image of Feb 26 lies deep in the stuff at the 
; extreme left edge of the fractal.  The image of Feb 27 lies in 
; the East Valley of the medium-sized minibrot on the northwest 
; shore line of the 'fan', which now opens to the north instead of 
; the east.
; 
; The image is not the exact parent.  Though I retained the same 
; color pallette, to add impact, I did change it a bit.
; 
; The name "Blast of Nothing" was inspired by the thought of the 
; currently popular and always mysterious "Dark Energy", which as 
; far as we know comes from nothing, yet is causing the entire 
; universe to fly apart.  Numbers are at least as abstract as Dark 
; Energy.
; 
; A curiosity of the Julibrot in which today's scene lies is that 
; the image extends far out, to perhaps infinity, in the 'Z' 
; planes.  This can be demonstrated by changing the value of 
; initial Z, the (p4) parameter, to extreme values.  Doing so 
; would normally soon result in a blank screen, but in today's 
; case, the image, though it changes, appears to go on forever.
; 
; The calculation time of only 45 seconds will pass in a flash.  
; The blinding flash can be avoided by visiting the FOTD web sites.
; 
; To view the image without risking blindness, check the official 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; But remember that this official site is on a schedule that is 
; different from the schedule of the mailing list.  Some images 
; may appear on the web site well before or after they are posted 
; to the mailing list.
; 
; Variations are online at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; with the back images safely stored and available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day brought lots of clouds and showers of both rain and 
; graupel to Fractal Central.  The fractal cat, never wondering 
; what graupel is, spent most of the day ensconced in my favorite 
; overstuffed wing chair.  The humans, still not up to average 
; after the failure of the flu shot, spent the day wondering just 
; why the pope resigned.  My opinion is that, when he realized 
; how bad the situation in the church actuially is and how futile 
; the task of saving it would be, he lost hope and gave up.  Most 
; likely, nothing less than another reformation is needed.
; 
; The next FOTD will soon be posted, and I cannot now be found, 
; nor will I ever be found on 'Twitter' or 'Facebook' or any other 
; new-fangled social-networking sites.
