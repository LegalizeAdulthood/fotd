; FOTD -- March 04, 2012 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's highly rated image might not be a true fractal at all.  
; It might be no more than an artifact of math imprecision.  But 
; whatever it is, it certainly looks like a fractal.
; 
; The object at the center is actually a minibrot on the southern 
; shore of East Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  (Reset the real(p4) 
; parameter to zero to see the undistorted minibrot.)  But I have 
; no idea what the bulish-gray fractal canopy partially covering 
; the minibrot might be.  The features of this canopy appear to be 
; true fractal stuff, and may be zoomed into to the limit of reso-
; lution.  And yes, changing the value of the real(p4) parameter 
; an order of magnitude or two will change the image.
; 
; I totally fail to see how a value as small as one-googlth or 
; 10^(-100) could have any actual effect on a fractal of magnitude 
; 10^(+008), but today's image does not lie.  Something certainly 
; has had quite an effect on the minibrot.
; 
; I have no theories about what is going on in the image.  All I 
; have done is show a most curious scene that I stumbled upon a 
; number of years ago.
; 
; The name "Translateration" sounds like it has a deep scientific 
; meaning.  Actually, as far as I know, it is nonsense.  I picked 
; up the word from a sci-fi novel I read many years ago.  I forget 
; the name of the novel.
; 
; The rating of a 9 is based on both the artistic and mathematical 
; merit.
; 
; Until the host of the official FOTD web site has won its 'war 
; against hackers' and is again up and running, the finished image 
; may be viewed at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and the FOTD back images may be viewed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A mix of clouds and sun with a temperature of 37F +3C made today 
; quite typical for a late winter day in central Pennsylvania.  
; Seeing no promise of dependable sun, the fractal cat lured me 
; from my favorite chair and took instant occupancy, defiantly 
; daring me to try to dislodge him.  The humans, pretty well recov-
; ered from the latest bug, had an average day.
; 
; The next FOTD will indeed be posted, and the most likely time of 
; the great event is around 24 hours from the time this FOTD is 
; posted.  Until whenever, take care, and 
;
