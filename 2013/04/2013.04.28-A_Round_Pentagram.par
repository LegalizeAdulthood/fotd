; FOTD -- April 28, 2013 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's scene shows a quintic minibrot, which unlike most 
; minibrots in the Z^5+C Mandeloid is actually interesting.  This 
; is because it is combined with the Z^2+C Mandelbrot set in such 
; a way that the excessively large and numerous minibrots found in 
; the Z^5+C Mandeloid are separated much more widely and the 
; in-between space filled in.
; 
; The parent fractal is an oversized Mandelbrot set already 
; starting to look a little weird in places.  Today's scene is 
; located in the basin of a larger quintic minibrot that lies in a 
; small island of debris inside the bud located just beyond the 
; large bud on the X-axis of the parent.
; 
; I named the image "A Round Pentagram" after the rounded 
; pentagram immediately surrounding the central minibrot.  A 
; pentagram is the familiar 5-pointed star, which is a religious 
; symbol when oriented with a point facing upward, and a symbol of 
; occultism when rotated 36 degrees so that it resembles a goat's 
; head, with a point facing downward.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is in the ball park of average.  If I had put 
; extra effort into the coloring, the image might have rated an 8.
; 
; The calculation time of a speed-of-light 45 seconds will pass in 
; a flash.  The flashing, which might be confused with bomb 
; testing, thereby causing a sudden unwelcome arrival of security 
; forces,  may be avoided by checking one of the web sites.
; 
; The finished image is posted online on the official FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; High-quality renderings are at:

; 
; and the back images are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A near perfect day prevailed here at Fractal Central today, with 
; lots of sun, gentle breezes and a temperature of 70F 21C.  
; Clouds arrived later in the afternoon, but by then all the 
; outdoor activities were nearly finished.  The fractal cat seems 
; to be resigned that no more sun will be falling on his window 
; shelf until autumn, and has claimed my favorite chair as his 
; bed.  The humans are resigned that autumn will eventually come, 
; followed by winter.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the divinely ordained time.  
; Until whenever that is, take care, and believe it or not, some 
; people actually are puzzled by the way I feel at peace when I am 
; out alone without a cell phone.  The truth is that it is quite 
; easy to be at peace when out of contact with others.  After 
; getting hooked on computers, I simply refused to become addicted 
; to any additional absolutely necessary conveniences of modern 
; technological life, without which survival would be in doubt.
