; FOTD -- April 25, 2013 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Butterfly Cookies".  The obvious reason 
; is that it reminds me of butterfly cookies.  In fact, it reminds 
; me so much of the cookies that, when I saw the image, I ran to 
; the local store to pick up a box.
; 
; The recipe behind the cookies combines a measly 0.1 part of Z^2 
; with a full part of Z^(-3) then adds C on each iteration.  The 
; resulting parent fractal is an oversized thing closely resem-
; bling some of those created by the parallel-resistance formula 
; posted on the list a week or so ago.  Its Mandelbrot shape is 
; apparent, but the normally empty inside parts are filled with 
; all kinds of superfluous decorations.  Today's scene lies on the 
; X-axis just beyond a large minibrot on the skeletal negative 
; spike.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is an improvement over yesterday's, but still 
; leaves lots of room for improvement.  Hopefully, tomorrow's 
; image will rate an 8, but there is no guarantee that it will not 
; check in at a rating of an embarrassing 6.
; 
; One thing not in dispute is the speed of today's image.  On my 
; far from SOTA machine it finishes in 20 seconds.  Some of the 
; current units will finish it in far less time, that is if they 
; can run the old Fractint DOS program at all.  Regardless, the 
; image is available on the FOTD web sites.
; 
; The official FOTD web site with the finished image may be found 
; at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Augmented variations of the image are online at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and the FOTD back images are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The weather was near perfect here at Fractal Central today, with 
; photoshop (old-kodachrome) blue skies and white cotton-puff cumu-
; lus clouds.  The only thing not perfect was the temperature, 
; which at a high of 57F 14C was notably chilly for late April.  
; The fractal cat would have preferred more sun on his shelf.  But 
; now that the sun is at a much higher angle it strikes only the 
; edge of the shelf closest to the window.  The humans, not very 
; concerned with sun angles, had an average day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a number of hours.  Until that 
; mysterious number of hours passes, take care, and thanks to 
; science we have life better today than at any time in the past.  
; Why then are so many people dis-satisfied with their lives?
