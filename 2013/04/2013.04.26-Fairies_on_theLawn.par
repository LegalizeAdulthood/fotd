; FOTD -- April 26, 2013 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Fairies on the Lawn".
; 
; I have heard it said that even though we never see fairies 
; dancing on the lawn, it is no sign they are not there.  Well, in 
; today's image the fairies are dancing on the screen and they are 
; quite visible.  True, they do not resemble tiny people, and why 
; should they?  They are 'arupa' fairies, basically bright little 
; bundles of energy with no definite shape.
; 
; I came upon the fairies as I was exploring the fractal that 
; results when 0.1 part of Z^2 is combined with 2 parts of Z^(-3) 
; and the whole thing is iterated with the bailout radius set to 
; 900.  This fractal is an oversized, well-decorated Mandelbrot 
; set overflowing with extra goodies such as islands inside the 
; main bay and superfluous minibrots everywhere.  Today's scene 
; lies just off the main stem near the spot where the large 
; minibrot should be.
; 
; The rating of 6.5 includes the half-point bonus for my coloring 
; efforts.  I'm not sure that the bonus was fully earned, but it 
; gives me a feeling of satisfaction to pat myself on the back 
; occasionally.
; 
; The calculation time of a fireball-fast 30 seconds will pass in 
; about 8 breaths.  Checking the finished image on the FOTD web 
; sites will save your breath.
; 
; The fairies dance online in finished form at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the image has been calculated and is posted.
; 
; The high-definition variations are at:

; 
; The back images are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; With photoshop blue skies, a few puffy white clouds, gentle 
; breezes and a temperature of 61F 16C, today's weather was near 
; perfect here at Fractal Central, and the fractal cat made the 
; most of it.  The fractal humans made the most of it also, while 
; we were busy on more important things however.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the near future.  Until the 
; future arrives, take care, and most everyone, even the 
; wealthiest, has occasional feelings that despite modern 
; technology something is missing in his or her life.  But it's 
; not so simple to pin down exactly what is missing or where it 
; might be found.
