; FOTD -- April 19, 2013 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "A Forest on Alpha-X", but to actually 
; see the forest with its strangely tinted sky beyond, it is 
; necessary to step back from the screen.   The impression of 
; a forest of trees lies in the overall shading, not the finer 
; details, which are more Mandelbrot than tree-like.
; 
; Apparently, on planet Alpha-X, the air is also filled with 
; flying insects, especially during the times of twilight, which 
; is the time of day illustrated in the image.  The clouds of bugs 
; are scattered all over the background.
; 
; The image was created by the MandNewt08 formula, which I wrote 
; quite a few years ago.  This formula is part of a series that 
; was intended to do something that I have long since forgotten.  
; The only thing I am sure of is that the series creates images 
; that share both Mandelbrot and Newton characteristics.
; 
; The rating of an 8 seems about right for the image, with a full 
; point of the rating due to the coloring, which took about 45 
; minutes to get almost but not quite right.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes is close to FOTD average.  
; The fastest way to enjoy the dusky forest scene is to view it in 
; finished form on one of the FOTD web sites.
; 
; To see the dusky scene without calculating it, surf over to the 
; official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and check the interesting variations at:

; 
; The back images are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The cloudy breezy weather today was offset by a temperature of 
; 73F 23C.  Light rain showers began in the afternoon, but by post 
; time had not amounted to much.  The fractal cat passed most of 
; the afternoon sleeping in my favorite chair and the rest of the 
; time asking for food.  The humans spent most of their time 
; watching the TV news.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a day of two.  Until whenever it 
; actually appears, take care, and now it looks like we'll need 
; tighter controls on home-made bombs.  And we'll also need to 
; keep more careful watch on those outgoing people with a lot of 
; friends, who never do anything suspicious.
