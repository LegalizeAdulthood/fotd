; FOTD -- April 16, 2013 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image it looks like we have come to the end of the 
; road.  The exponent of Z is 1.004, and even searching as much as 
; I could, I found none of the fractal semi-chaos that produces 
; the most interesting designs.  What I did fine was today's 
; image, which is quite fractal in nature, remaining the same no 
; matter how deeply into it one dives.
; 
; So I guess this is the end of the road as we approach an expo-
; nent of unity, at least with my less-than-light-speed 12-year-
; old fractal dedicated machine.  A super-speed SOTA unit might 
; find that some interesting stuff does lie beyond the edges of 
; today's image, but I'm not going to try to find it.
; 
; The rating of a 5 is below FOTD average.  The name "Bottom of 
; the Pile" indicates the position of the generating expression.  
; The calculation time is inexcusably slow.  Over 1/4 hour will 
; pass between the time the <enter> key is struck and the image-
; finished chirp sounds.  I recommend turning to one of the web 
; sites for relief.
; 
; The finished image may be viewed at:

; 
; with hi-def variations at:

; 
; and back images at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Lots of clouds, a little sun and a few showers, with a tempera-
; ture of 68F 19C made today a pretty average one here at Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cat Nicholas grabbed my chair when I got 
; up from it at lunch time to reach for the remote control, and 
; turned defiant when I tried to return to it.  FL was on Nico's 
; side in the chair dispute.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted within a reasonable time.  Until 
; reason prevails, take care, and it looks like we need tighter 
; controls on those household items and substances that could be 
; used in the creation of explosives.  It might be impractical but 
; at least it would make us feel better.
