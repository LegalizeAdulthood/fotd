; 
; FOTD -- July 07, 2013 (Rating A-6,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The name of today's image, "Seven And One Half", says it all.  
; The oversized parent Mandelbrot set is corrupted in its depths 
; by Z^(7.5) energies, and today's scene lies in the remnants of 
; the East Valley area of the largest main-spike minibrot beyond 
; the great minibrot.
; 
; Unlike the situation that existed in the recent half-power 
; images, the one large discontinuity in today's image is quite 
; obvious.  It lies on the left side of the minibrot, though it is 
; still quite hard to determine exactly what is going on in the 
; arrangement of the spiral arms.
; 
; The artistic rating of 6 and math rating of 5 also says it all.  
; The image is, well, interesting, while the math theme is pretty 
; well worn out.  But not being one to give up quickly, I will 
; stick with the power-and-a-half theme for at least one or two 
; more images.
; 
; Today's image is a rather slow one, making a trip to one of the 
; web sites a wise choice if impatience is to be avoided.
; 
; The official FOTD web site, with the finished image, is at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Hi-def renderings are at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The blast-from-the-past FOTD images are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A hot sultry day here at Fractal Central, with a temperature of 
; 93F 34C and humidity to match, suddenly became quite pleasant at 
; 5pm when a thunder storm struck with heavy rain and 60mph, 
; 100kph, winds.  When the storm moved out 20 minutes later, the 
; street was littered with fallen tree limbs and the temperature 
; was a far more reasonable 73F 23C.  The fractal cat noticed the 
; change by switching from stretched-out mode to curled-up mode.  
; The humans simply enjoyed the refreshing change, though FL spent 
; time propping up flowers that had flopped over in the tempest.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in something near 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and the next time you're abducted by aliens, 
; be sure to take along a camera.  Such pictures would certainly 
; go viral on the internet.  Many people still don't believe in 
; the aliens.
