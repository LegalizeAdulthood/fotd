; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- July 5, 2013 (Rating A-7,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in an oversized Mandelbrot set 
; corrupted in its depths by Z^(5.5) energies.  Once again the 
; number of outer elements is twice the order number of the inner 
; minibrot.  Also, the discontinuities are again almost invisible. 
; The most obvious streaks out from the minibrot toward the 
; northwest, but vanishes before it interrupts the near-perfect 
; symmetry of the 11 outer elements.
; 
; To find today's scene, travel out the main spike of the parent 
; M-set until you reach the largest minibrot between the set 
; itself and the main minibrot.  Then go to the large minibrot on 
; the west branch of the filament extending from the period-3 
; northern bud of this main-stem minibrot.  This sub-minibrot is 
; well on the way to becoming an order 5.5 one.  Today's scene 
; lies somewhere in the area that once was its East Valley.
; 
; The name "Five and One-Half" refers to the order of the 
; corruption infecting the parent M-set.
; 
; The art rating of 7 indicates that I consider the art aspect of 
; the image to be a little better than the math aspect, which is 
; now becoming a bit stale.  Despite the staleness however, I will 
; continue this math course until it becomes boring.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-5/6 minutes is slow enough to give 
; boredom a chance to raise its head.  The web sites are there to 
; relieve boredom.
; 
; Check the finished image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; with a hi-def rendering at:
;

; 
; and the FOTD back images at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Typical midsummer weather prevailed here at Fractal Central 
; today, as the temperature reached a high of 91F 33C under a sky 
; filled with billowing cumulus clouds, and the humidity made 
; things appropriately uncomfortable.  The fractal cat passed the 
; day stretched on the bathroom tile floor, while the fractal 
; humans spent the day working.  All in all, the day makes very 
; dull reporting, not at all like the days of twelve years ago, 
; when the original fractal cats, Thomas and Tippy, spent the 
; summer days prowling the area around old Fractal Central, 
; lurking in the holly thicket, chasing birds, driving away 
; intruding cats and getting into other assorted mischief.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted when the time is right.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and I have yet to see someone who thinks 
; the world is real actually prove that it is real.
