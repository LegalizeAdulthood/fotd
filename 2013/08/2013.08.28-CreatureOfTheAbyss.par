; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- August 28, 2013 (Rating A-7,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image comes to us straight from the abyss.  This is why 
; I named it "Creature of the Abyss".  The most abysmal thing 
; about the image is that its parent fractal does not exist.  
; Check and see!  If the inside is reset to 'numb' the image 
; itself as well as the parent becomes only a blank screen.  The 
; negative exponent, Z^(-0.75), assures that no outside stuff will 
; appear in the fractal.
; 
; But as the FOTD 'evaporated' fractals have often shown, blank 
; inside stuff is sometimes filled with hidden activity, which can 
; be made manifest by the active inside fills.  In today's image 
; the 'bof60' fill does the job.
; 
; There is little to say about the image, which is impossible to 
; describe, and must be seen to be fully appreciated.  It appears 
; as a random mixture of smoothly blended broad areas and 
; chaotically scrambled fine detail, with a kind of Mandelbrot bud 
; trying to get started toward the bottom center.
; 
; Both the art and math ratings are 7's, which are merely average 
; and make the calculation time of six minutes too slow for 
; comfort.  Luckily, the web sites are ready to bring relief.

; 
; Heavy clouds ruled the roost here at Fractal Central today, 
; though after an early morning shower ended, the rest of the day 
; was dry.  Due to the high humidity, the temperature of 81F 27C 
; felt more oppressive than would be expected.  The fractal cat 
; stretched out on the floor, then took to the back of the 
; entertainment shelf.  The humans had another in a long series of 
; uneventful days, so if you're looking for soap-opera style 
; relationship stuff, look elsewhere.
; 
; The next FOTD will most likely be posted in 24 hours.  The time 
; next most likely is in 48 hours.  Until whenever, take care, and 
; be alert for the Anunnaki.  We're not sure if they're good or 
; evil, but they're involved in more conspiracies than anyone 
; could imagine.
