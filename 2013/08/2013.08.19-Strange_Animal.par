; 
; FOTD -- August 19, 2013 (Rating A-8,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the depths of its Mandelbrot set parent, 
; which is corrupted in its mid-depths by Z^5 energies.  The exact 
; location lies deep in an anti-East Valley (West Valley with East 
; Valley characteristics) in a small, obscure minibrot on the main 
; spike of the parent.  This minibrot has been caught about 
; halfway through the process of morphing from quadratic to 
; quintic.
; 
; The much smaller minibrot at the center of today's image has 
; already completed the transition from quadratic to quintic 
; nature, but its quadratic tendencies still show strongly in the 
; shape of the surrounding pattern, which obviously reflects the 
; Mandelbrot shape.  The whole thing makes a strange animal 
; indeed, which is what I named the image.
; 
; The artistic value of an 8 reflects the extra effort I put into 
; the coloring.  After all, without good coloring, a fractal is 
; little more than a screen filled with meaningless chaos.  The 
; math value of a 7 shows the unlikeliness of quintic and 
; quadratic elements appearing in the same fractal.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes is fast enough to 
; eliminate any significant waste of time and effort in rendering 
; the image.  But the task of running a parameter file still 
; remains.  This task may be eliminated by visiting one of the 
; FOTD web sites.
; 
; Those with calculation anxiety or over-qualified machines can 
; find the finished image posted on most or all of the following 
; web sites:

; 
; Heavy clouds, a morning shower and an afternoon temperature of 
; 75F 24C left a depressing pall over the Fractal Central area 
; today.  The fractal cat, never one to be seriously depressed, 
; stretched on the floor, then took comfort under his favorite 
; chair cover.  The humans made it through another day, with the 
; most memorable thing being the FOTD fractal.
; 
; The next fractal will be posted as soon as I find one worth 
; posting, (my standards are becoming higher), and find the time 
; to write something about it.  Until whenever that might be, take 
; care, and watch for the first signs of the impending collapse of 
; our western culture.
; 
; Am I serious?  That's for me to know and the readers to guess.
