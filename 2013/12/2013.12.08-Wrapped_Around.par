; FOTD -- December 08, 2013 (Rating A-8,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image came about when I took the expression Z^(1.333)+C, 
; calculated it 7 levels up the hyperspiral (hyperladder) with the 
; 'floor' function applied, and checked the resulting fractal.
; 
; The name of today's FOTD, "Wrapped Around", does not refer to 
; the image itself, but to the parent fractal in which it lies.  
; This parent has been caught in the act of wrapping around the 
; complex logarithmic hyperspiral and slipping off into uncharted 
; higher dimensions.  It consists of a large twisted open area 
; with two broken chaotic filaments extending north and west, and 
; a prominent bud on the southeast shore line.  Today's scene lies 
; not too far out in the chaotic filament extending to the north.  
; I have not yet checked the bud.
; 
; The art aspect rates an 8, which is justified because the image 
; is one of the better ones I have found in the exponent range 
; between unity and two.  And I really did put extra effort into 
; the coloring.  The math aspect rates a 7, with a good part part 
; of the worth lying in the parent fractal, which has been caught 
; spiraling off into another world.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/4 minutes is close to the average 
; time it takes for a fractal to calculate on today's fireball 
; fast but not always DOS capable machines.  The web sites can 
; deliver the image faster, with no DOS compatibility problems.
; 
; So save calculation time.  See the finished image online at:

; 
; Cloudy cold weather with a temperature of 27F -3C prevailed here 
; at Fractal Central today, with light snow beginning in the 
; afternoon and worse to come tonight.  The fractal cats, who do 
; not appreciate their snug warm home, kept watch for the unlucky 
; cats outside, who have no snug warm home to go to to keep them 
; comfortable.  In fact, Nico growled and hissed from the window 
; when one of them wandered into the yard, looking for food.  The 
; fractal humans spent the day battening down for the winter 
; storm, which might not be as bad as some are forecasting.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a reasonable time.  If the storm 
; causes problems, it might not be for a couple days.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and everyone knows what must be done to 
; stop climate change and save the earth, but no one wants to 
; inconvenience themselves enough to do it.
