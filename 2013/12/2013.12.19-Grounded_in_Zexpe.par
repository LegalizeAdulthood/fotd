; 
; FOTD -- December 19, 2013 (Rating A-7,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the fractal that many years ago was 
; named the Zexpe fractal by Lee Skinner, who did extensive work 
; on it.   The Zexpe is the fractal that results when the 
; expression Z^(epsilon)+C is iterated in the Mandelbrot mode.  
; The usual Julia variations also exist, but we are not concerned 
; with these in today's image.
; 
; The Zexpe fractal is just one of an infinity of fractals that 
; can be created by the manzpower formula of Fractint when the 
; value of the exponent is varied.  But the manzpower calculation 
; involves complex logarithms, which are multi-valued and when 
; calculated by the MandelbrotBC3 formula, can create an infinity 
; of fractals for every possible fractional value of Z.  So there 
; are actually an infinity of Zexpe fractals to be explored.
; 
; Today's image lies in the Zexpe Mandeloid fractal that comes 
; about when the expression Z^(e)+C is iterated by the 
; MandelbrotBC3 formula at ground level of the hyperladder with no 
; function applied.  This parent resembles a quadratic M-set 
; rotated 90 degrees, with an ersatz main bud on the north side 
; and an ersatz East Valley on the south side.  There is some kind 
; of pathological growth on the southwestern side of the main bay, 
; but this does not enter into today's image, which lies in the 
; East Valley of the parent.
; 
; The name "Grounded in Zexpe" implies that the image lies in one 
; of the Zexpe fractals and was calculated at ground level of the 
; hyperladder.  The art rating of a 7 and math rating of a 6 
; indicates that the artistic worth is about average and there is 
; little new stuff to be found in the math aspect of the image.  
; Luckily, the calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes is fast enough to 
; keep fidgetiness and impatience at bay.  The web sites can 
; eliminate the fidgetiness.
; 
; Enjoy the finished image at:

; 
; Where the image may be seen without the chore of calculating it.  
; And be sure to check the variations at:

; 
; The sunshine was dimmed by haze today here at Fractal Central, 
; but the temperature of 41F +5C was the warmest in two weeks.  
; New fractal cat Jazzy celebrated the thaw by starting a tussle 
; with Nico, but when Nico forgot his strength and got a bit too 
; rough, Jazzy called it quits and ducked under the bed.  The 
; fractal humans simply had another normal day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the appropriate time, whenever 
; that might be.  Until then, take care, and before we condemn the 
; evil big greedy corporations who care only about their profits 
; and don't concern themselves with poverty, let's check to see 
; who is giving them the money that makes them so profitable.
