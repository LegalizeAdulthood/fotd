; 
; FOTD -- December 12, 2013 (Rating A-8,M-8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's striking image rates an 8, which is a pretty good rating 
; for a fractal that does not exist.  The image is a manifestation 
; of a totally evaporated Julia set, consisting of nothing but 
; inside stuff, which if left unchanged, would be a total blank.  
; The Mandelbrot set it comes from is also totally blank inside 
; stuff.
; 
; The manifestation has nothing to do with the appearance of a 
; religious savior.  It appears when the apparently featureless 
; inside stuff is rendered with an active inside fill such as the 
; bof60, which can dredge up something from nothing.
; 
; The reason for the art rating of an 8 is obvious when the image 
; is seen.  The reason for the math rating of an 8 is a bit more 
; subtle, but it assuredly is there.  I chose the name "The Rags 
; of Time" because it has a rather poetic sound to it.  I can see 
; nothing in the image to justify such a name.
; 
; The calculation time of a mere 8 seconds can be cut to near 4 
; seconds by calculating the image with the symmetry set to 
; 'origin'.  If this is still too slow, the web sites are ready to 
; ride to the rescue.
;

; 
; The partly cloudy skies here at Fractal Central today were no 
; problem.  The temperature of 21F -6C was another story however.  
; The fractal cats had a reasonably quiet day, though 4-month-old 
; fractal kitten Jazzy sometimes annoys 10-year-old fractal cat 
; Nico when she wants to play and he wants to sleep.  A warning 
; hiss or mild growl usually puts her off.  The fractal humans had 
; a day of finishing the seasonal fractal decorations for the 
; holidays, which are Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanza, Solstice and 
; the New Year etc.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted either tomorrow or in 24 hours.  It 
; makes no difference to me.  Until whenever, take care, and 
; sometimes it's hard to keep everyone happy.
