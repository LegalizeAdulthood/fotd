; FOTD -- December 02, 2013 (Rating A-7,M-8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the parent fractal that results when 
; Z to the power of 1.021897 is iterated at ground level of the 
; hyperladder with no function applied.  Not coincidentally, this 
; value is the square root of the exponent of yesterday's image, 
; and also the 32nd root of 2.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image closely resembles the parent 
; of yesterday's image, though with less chaos along the edges of 
; the large bay, which is shaped much like an elephant seal with a 
; large pendulous nose.  Today's image is located in the chaos 
; near the straight southern shore line of the large bay.
; 
; The amount of semi-organized detail in the scene is unexpected 
; in a fractal created by an exponent of 1.02..., but images do 
; not lie, and the stuff in today's image did not come from 
; nowhere.  (Or did it?)
; 
; The name "Thirty-Second Root" refers to the exponent of Z.  The 
; art rating of a 7 indicates that the image is worthwhile, though 
; perhaps not as striking as some past fractal scenes.  The math 
; rating of an 8 shows that the amount of detail in the image is 
; quite unexpected.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes will pass quickly enough.
; 
; For convenience, the image has already been calculated and 
; posted to the official FOTD web site at:
;

; 
; A cloudy sky and temperature of 41F +5C made today entirely 
; un-notable here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats, who are 
; not quite ready to share the window shelf, took turns watching 
; the outside scene.  The fractal humans, who wonder what the 
; world is coming to, kept their wonder alive by watching the TV 
; news at lunch time.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted soon.  Until whenever that might 
; be, take care, and when people dislike a big corporation, they 
; usually fight it by organizing a boycott against the 
; corporation's products.  The big oil corporations certainly are 
; disliked, even hated, so where are the cries for a boycott of 
; products derived from petroleum
