; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- October 27, 2013 (Rating A-8,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the parent fractal that results when 3.5 
; parts of Z^(-1.1) are combined with 0.5 part of Z^(-5.5) before 
; (1/C) is added on each iteration.  The default screen view of 
; this parent is little more than a field of unorganized blobs 
; forming a hint of a valley, but two full outzooms reveals a 
; fully formed but quite distorted Mandeloid, with a ring-lined 
; filament extending southeast to where it joins a large ring.  
; Today's scene, with its abundance of sharp bright spikes, lies 
; near the point where this filament joins the large ring.
; 
; Since the season is one of fright, and sharp things such as 
; daggers and axes are trendy at this time of year, when I saw the 
; scary sharpness in the image, I named it "Fright Night".
; 
; With a modicum of coloring effort going into the image, its 
; rating is worth an honorable 8.  The math worth remains a 6, 
; since the MandAutoCritInZ formula has been doing its thing for 
; over a decade, and has long since lost its math impact.
; 
; The calculation time of 4 minutes is slow, no denying it, but 
; once again the web sites are on the job, with not only the 
; original image but assorted variations as well.
; 
; The finished image is available on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; which may soon be re-designed with new and greater features.
; 
; The image with additional variations is available at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and also at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; and:
; 
;   <http://user.xmission.com/~legalize/fractals/fotd/about.html>
; 
; Today brought a mix of sun and clouds to Fractal Central, while 
; the breeze from the northwest and temperature of 54F 12C added 
; a proper end-of-October atmosphere to the scene.  The fractal 
; cats, still interested in getting accustomed to each other, had 
; little interest in the outside conditions.  The humans had a 
; reasonably quiet day.
; 
; The next FOTD will likely be posted in about one day, but 
; possibly two days.  Until next time, take care, and they can't 
; put it on the news shows if it isn't true.  Or can they?...
