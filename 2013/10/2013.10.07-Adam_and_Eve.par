; FOTD -- October 07, 2013 (Rating A-8,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The question might arise as to why I named today's image "Adam 
; and Eve".  The answer is simple.  While searching for a name, I 
; noticed four 'fig leaves' in the corners of the image -- one 
; leaf for Adam and three for Eve.  (Don't ask for details.)  The 
; name then came automatically.
; 
; The generating formula is the same one that I have used for the 
; past week or so, which mixes various portions of Z, Z^3, 1/Z and 
; Z^2.  Today's parent Mandeloid is the one that results when Z is 
; initialized to the critical point at 0.098...  This parent 
; resembles two partially critical M-sets sitting butt to butt 
; with a very prominent valley separating the two main bays.  
; Today's scene lies on the eastern edge of the northern branch of 
; this valley.  The western edge, which I will check in tomorrow's 
; FOTD, holds entirely different sub-features.
; 
; The artistic worth of 8 is mostly due to the coloring.  
; Rendering the scene with the inside set to 'fmod' produced the 
; smoothly curved elements that have been colored.  The math value 
; of 5 indicates that the math trick has lost all impact.  This 
; rating will remain until we move on to a new julibrot.
; 
; The image calculates in 1-1/2 minutes on most all modern 
; machines, but calculation is still a bit of a chore.
; 
; So to make life easier, check the finished images at:

; 
; Today began cloudy here at Fractal Central.  Rain arrived in a 
; sudden heavy squall just before noon with a 40mph 60kph wind, 
; and continued lighter into the afternoon.  The temperature fell 
; from 75F 24C late in the morning to 59F 15C at post time, and it 
; is still dropping.  The fractal cat slept through most of the 
; heavy rain, but became active when a flap arose among the local 
; pigeons.  We humans made it through the day without incident, as 
; we have done on countless previous days.
; 
; The next FOTD will be created and posted within a reasonable 
; time.  Until reason prevails, take care, and some big questions 
; have no simple answers.
