; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- October 10, 2013 (Rating A-6,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image I mixed straight Z with 0.5 part of Z^2, 
; 0.333... part of Z^3 and 0.25 part of Z^4 and then set initial 
; Z to -1, the critical point of the mixture.  (I entered the 
; value as -0.999... because of a program glitch.)  The resulting 
; Mandeloid resembles a Mandelbrot set with two large wings 
; sprouting from the north and south sides of the East Valley, 
; which is grossly enlarged but, at least on the surface, not very 
; interesting.
; 
; Today's image does not lie in this area however.  It is located 
; very deep, near a larger minibrot in a minor valley on the east 
; shore line of an oddly shaped minibrot on a filament extending 
; from the large period-3 bud on the northwest shore line of the 
; main bay.  
; 
; The art and math aspects both rate a 6, which is a little above 
; average but nothing to get excited about.  The colors clash too 
; much and are too splotchy to rate anything higher, and the math 
; is nothing new either.  I might have done better with the colors 
; if I had not become preoccupied with four-dimensional stuff.
; 
; The name I gave to the image, "The Worm has Turned", had some 
; meaning when I thought of it, but I have since lost track of 
; whatever the meaning might have been.
; 
; The slow calculation time of 7-1/4 minutes may be avoided by 
; checking the FOTD web sites.
;

; 
; A cloudy sky with a temperature of 59F 15C kept spirits under 
; wraps here at Fractal Central today.  The fractal cat hid his 
; depression under the chair cover; the fractal humans had too 
; much other stuff to do to feel very depressed.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted before long.  The discussion should 
; include a bit about four-dimensional curiosities, especially the 
; weird motion possible only in space of more than three 
; dimensions known as double rotation.  Until then, take care, and 
; this Saturday we will see what the wooly bear caterpillars have 
; to say about the weather of the coming winter.
