; FOTD -- October 11, 2013 (Rating A-9,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Those who have no interest in the fourth dimension should skip 
; to the start of the fractal stuff 12 paragraphs below.  The 
; image is pretty good, at least in my humble opinion.
; 
; The fourth spatial dimension, where the Julibrots live, holds 
; many things that defy common sense when they are squeezed into 
; our everyday three dimensional space.  One of the most curious 
; is the strange motion known as double rotation, in which a 4-D 
; object such as a hypersphere may rotate around two absolutely 
; perpendicular planes at the same time, with each plane rotating 
; on itself independently of the motion of the other plane.  
; 
; In 3-D space, when two rotations are applied to an object, the 
; rotations combine into a single resultant rotation, but a 
; double-rotating 4-D hyper-object is in an entirely different 
; condition.  This strange motion is impossible to visualize in 
; 3-D space, but with some effort I have worked up a crude 
; visualization of a hypersphere subject to double rotation.  
; Hopefully, my description will communicate at least some of my 
; visualization.
; 
; The trick is to rotate the view in 4-D space.  I begin by 
; visualizing a 3-D sphere like the earth.  On the curved 2-D 
; surface of this 3-D sphere, it is possible to move away from the 
; equator at a right angle in only two directions.  On the earth 
; these directions are straight north and south, and following 
; these two geodesics one will reach the polar points of the 
; rotating sphere.
; 
; But on the curved 3-D surface of a 4-D hypersphere it is 
; possible to move away from the equatorial circle at a right 
; angle in any direction in a plane perpendicular to the 
; equatorial circle.  Regardless of the direction one chooses, if 
; he sets out at 90 degrees to the equator and follows a straight 
; geodesic line on the surface of the hypersphere, he will 
; intersect the polar circle.  The direction in which he sets out 
; determines the point of the polar circle he will intersect.
; 
; I now drop a dimension and rotate the view 90 degrees.  The 
; equatorial circle vanishes except for the point at which the 
; explorer is standing.  He now sees himself as standing at a pole 
; of the sphere.  The great circle he sees circling the spherical 
; slice of the hypersphere at 90 degrees from his location is the 
; actual polar circle.  This is as close as I can come to 
; visualizing a hypersphere.  I do it one 3-D slice at a time.
; 
; Rotating back so that the entire equatorial circle is again in 
; view, the explorer sees that the visible part of the hypersphere 
; is rotating exactly as the earth does, with the equatorial 
; circle rotating on itself.  He now is observing a 3-D slice of a 
; hypersphere in a state of a single rotation, and though he 
; cannot see it, he knows that every point of the the polar 
; axis-plane is remaining stationary while it turns in place.  Now 
; the fun begins.
; 
; There is nothing to prevent the polar axis from rotating on 
; itself also, with the equatorial circle as its axis, and when it 
; does, the two rotations are totally independent.  The resulting 
; motion of the hypersphere is called double rotation and like 
; everything else in 4-D space, it is impossible to visualize.
; 
; But to make an effort at visualization, let's assume that, just 
; as on earth, the equatorial circle is rotating on itself once 
; every 24 hours.  So far, so good.  But now let's assume that the 
; polar circle is rotating on itself once every hour.  While 
; standing very near the equator, the explorer finds his location 
; on the hypersphere rotating around the closest point of the 
; equator while being carried forward with the equator and tracing 
; out a kind of helix.
; 
; The explorer sees the point where he stands rotating around the 
; equator 24 times every time the equator makes one revolution on 
; itself, but the point is not tracing out a simple 3-D helix 
; looped into a ring, only a close approximation.  The farther 
; from the equatorial circle he wanders, the stranger the motion 
; becomes.  If the explorer were standing very close to the polar 
; circle, he would find the point rotating around the entire 
; hypersphere 24 times before it rotated around the polar circle 
; once, tracing out something like a twisted garden hose, and if 
; he stationed himself at a point halfway between the two axis 
; circles, the point would trace out something that could be 
; visualized only by a being with 4-D vision.  The incredible part 
; is that the hypersphere remains rigid while subject to double 
; rotation, undergoing no strain or distortion.
; 
; A vague idea of the motion of double rotation can be found by 
; observing the 3-D shadow of a double-rotating skeletal 4-D 
; hypercube.  Such projections are probably on the internet, 
; though I have not yet searched.
; 
; The fun does not end here however.  In six-dimensional space, 
; triple rotation is possible, but that's a story for another day.
; 
; Now let's get to today's fractal.
; 
; To create today's image I cut the portions of Z of yesterday's 
; formula in half.  This keeps the critical point unchanged.  The 
; resulting parent Mandeloid is larger than yesterday's, with more 
; prominent 'wings'.
; 
; Today's scene lies near a minibrot northeast of the north wing 
; of its parent.  This minibrot is connected to the main body of 
; the parent by a broken filament, but unlike almost all 
; minibrots, which are connected to the main body of the parent at 
; their East Valleys, this minibrot is connected at the southern 
; branch of its Seahorse Valley.  Today's scene lies in this 
; strange Seahorse Valley connection.
; 
; I named the image "Vision in the Sky".  Something about it 
; reminds me of a dream I had long ago, where I saw a similar 
; object in the sky.  The math interest rates only a 6, but the 
; artistic value is a superior 9.
; 
; The rather lengthy calculation time of 4-1/2 minutes is a 
; drawback.  The web sites will remove this problem however.
; 
; Enjoy freedom from calculation pains by viewing the finished 
; image at one of the web sites at:

; 
; After a night that brought 3.25 inches, 8cm of rain and some 
; minor flooding, today dawned cloudy with light rain still 
; falling.  The rain ended before noon and the sky brightened in 
; the afternoon, but the sun failed to appear.  The temperature of 
; 64F 18C gave no cause for complaint.  The fractal cat, who does 
; not like water, spent the day checking the outside conditions 
; and sleeping under the chair cover.  The humans were thankful 
; that the heavy rain resulted in only a few small puddles in the 
; fractal basement.
; 
; The next FOTD fractal will be posted in the proper time, October 
; 13 is the best guess.  Until whenever, take care, and don't be 
; concerned if you fail to understand what I have written say 
; about the fourth dimension and double rotation.  I don't 
; understand it myself.
