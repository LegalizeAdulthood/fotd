; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- October 25, 2013 (Rating A-8,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image I combined 2 parts of Z^(-2.5) with one part of 
; Z^(-4.5) and added (1/C).  The parent fractal that results is a 
; large shapeless open area filled with blobs of debris.  Two 
; large irregular rings lie to the west of this open area, which 
; are connected by one of the strangest minibrots, (If a minibrot 
; is what it is.), that I have yet found.  Today's scene lies just 
; to the southeast of this 'minibrot', on a filament extending 
; from it.  The trip in from the surface or out to it is quite 
; interesting.
; 
; The name "Star of Anchara" indicates that today's image lies 
; deep inside its parent fractal, just as, according to some 
; fringe groups, the mystic land of Anchara lies deep in the 
; interior of the planet earth.
; 
; The artistic rating of an 8 shows that extra effort went into 
; the coloring.  But the math rating of a 6 shows that, except for 
; the strange minibrot on the parent's surface, little new math 
; interest lies in the image.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 seconds will pass in a couple 
; flashes.  A visit to the web sites will cut the flashes down to 
; one.
; 
; To enjoy today's mathematical wonder with a minimum of effort, 
; check the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and also the sites at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; and
; 
;   <http://user.xmission.com/~legalize/fractals/fotd/about.html>
; 
; where interesting variations are posted.
; 
; More clouds than sun, with a temperature of 50F 10C, kept the 
; Halloween feeling quite strong here at Fractal Central today.  
; The fractal cats spent the day testing each other's limits.  The 
; new little 1-kg girl, Jasmine, is learning that she must give 
; the older 6-1/2-kg guy, Nicholas, a bit of peace now and then, 
; and the older guy is learning that the newcomer cannot be batted 
; around at will.  The fractal humans made sure the fractal cats 
; understood the rules.
; 
; The next FOTD will probably not be posted until Oct. 27.  Until 
; then, take care, and what about bigfoots and other assorted 
; monsters?  With all the well-founded reports of sightings, it is 
; impossible, except in the opinions of hard-core skeptics, to 
; shrug off all these reports as delusions of the gullible.  At 
; the same time, if such monsters did exist, we would certainly 
; have found some hard evidence such as bodies by this time.  And 
; BTW, let's get Sebastien back on the list.  He comes up with 
; some pretty good images, and I'm not sure why he quit the list 
; in the first place.
