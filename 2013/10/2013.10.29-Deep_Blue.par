; FOTD -- October 28, 2013 (Rating A-8,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; We return today to the best known fractal of all, the Mandelbrot 
; set, where we check the main stem and find a minibrot on a high-
; order filament radiating from a series of ever-smaller minibrots.
; 
; Most of the somber effect is due to my coloring, which earns the 
; art aspect an excellent 6.  Since the M-set is the best known of 
; all fractals, the math is so familiar that I could rate the math 
; aspect no higher than a 5.
; 
; The name "Deep Blue" refers to the heavy color scheme.  Yes, my 
; colors do seem to be becoming more depressive lately, but there 
; is nothing much I can do about it, since I am only partly in 
; control of the appearance of the images.  (To see a change in 
; the appearance of the image, reset the bailout to 10.)
; 
; The scene lies deep enough to make arbitrary precision math 
; necessary.  This greatly slows the calculation time, but the 
; main stem is a fast area for arbitrary precision math, and the 
; final calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes is well within reason.  
; If any unreason remains, the web sites can bring a return to the 
; world of reason.
; 
; View the finished product quite reasonably at:

; 
; Near perfect end-of-October weather prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central today.  The older fractal cat tried to enjoy the sun on 
; his shelf, but the new fractal cat kept annoying him by batting 
; at his dangling tail.  He finally had enough and tucked his tail 
; under him.  The fractal humans had a slow but pleasant day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the proper time.  Until we find 
; out what time is proper, take care, and a rational world view 
; would be far simpler to maintain if rational physicists doing 
; serious science didn't keep theorizing invisible worlds that 
; obviously remind people of the spirit worlds claimed to exist by 
; spiritualists.
