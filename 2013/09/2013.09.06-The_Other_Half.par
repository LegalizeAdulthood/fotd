; 
; FOTD -- September 06, 2013 (Rating A-6,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal was created with the same iterated expression as 
; yesterday's, but it is found in an entirely different parent 
; fractal.  This is because today's parent fractal was initialized 
; to a different critical point, which appears as the value of the 
; real(p5) parameter.
; 
; I used the Fractint program to plot a second critical point 
; graphically.  (Fractint can draw basic graphs in which critical 
; points can be tracked down and measured.)  I do not do this very 
; often because the process is tedious, but in today's case the 
; result was satisfying.  I found a new fractal, resembling 
; yesterday's parent in some aspects but differing in other ways.
; 
; I named today's image "The Other Half" because it is a scene in 
; a parent fractal that is the second critical slice of 
; yesterday's Julibrot.
; 
; Once again, the artistic value of 6 lags behind the math value 
; of 7, which makes the 13-minute calculation time not much of a 
; bargain.  But the web sites are always there to save time and 
; frustration.
; 
; Be rational and unfrustrated.  Check the finished images at:

; 
; With its totally cloudless skies, today would have been 
; absolutely perfect if it had been just a few degrees warmer here 
; at Fractal Central.  As it was, the morning low of 43F +6C and 
; afternoon high of 70F 21C were a little too chilly for relaxing 
; in the outdoor shade.  The fractal cat relaxed under a chair 
; cover, where he spent the afternoon as little more than a lump.  
; The fractal humans, who are anything but normal, had a normal 
; day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted when I get in the mood to do it.  
; Long experience says that the time will be either 24 or 48 
; hours.  To be sure when, check back at these times.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and when bad guys use guns to kill innocent 
; people, the liberals say we should solve the problem by passing 
; laws that will affect only the good guys who have guns.  
; (Criminals don't obey laws.)  This is crazy enough, but then the 
; conservatives say we should solve the problem by increasing the 
; number of guns in circulation, so we will be ready to protect 
; ourselves from the bad guys.  Would the rational side please 
; stand up.
