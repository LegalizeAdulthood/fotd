; FOTD -- September 19, 2013 (Rating A-6,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the world that results when the 
; expression Z^1.666... is iterated PI levels up the hyperladder.  
; This world is a parent fractal with a football shaped main bay 
; centered at the origin, with XY symmetry and large buds on the 
; Y-axis at the north and south edges of the football.  Except for 
; these two prominent buds, the shore line of the fractal, though 
; lined with sandy debris, is exceptionally free of buds.
; 
; A prominent minibrot lies in the debris on the ENE shore line of 
; the main bay.  This minibrot also exists in the other three 
; symmetrical quadrants.  Today's scene lies near another minibrot 
; near the large prominent northeast minibrot, but beyond its 
; field of influence.
; 
; The image has a somewhat creepy feeling, with the yellowish 
; tendrils reaching outward from the minibrot in the upper left 
; corner, ready to wrap around and snatch away any fractalist 
; unwary enough to stray within reach.
; 
; I named the image "Lime PI in the Sky" as kind of a joke.  Key 
; lime pie is my favorite pie, and PI is a transcendental number, 
; which certainly has no flavor.  Also, 'pie in the sky' is what 
; is sometimes said of the dream of those who put too much faith 
; in hypothetical bliss to come in the sky in heaven after they 
; die.  (I'm not saying it isn't so, but I have yet to see any 
; convincing signs that it is.)
; 
; The rating of both the art and math aspects is an everyday 6, 
; while the lengthy calculation time of 3-1/3 minutes removes any 
; pretense of the image being a bargain.  Salvation of the 
; material kind is available on the FOTD web sites.
; 
; For calculation relief, the image may be viewed already 
; calculated on the following web sites:

; 
; Cloudless skies and a temperature of 75F 24C made today nearly 
; ideal here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cat celebrated the 
; fine outside weather from the inside.  Instead of sleeping the 
; afternoon away, he got in the mood for play, and satisfied 
; himself when I brought out a string, which he chased and caught. 
; The humans had more mundane things to do.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted when I get a round tuit.  Until I 
; find the tuit, take care, and people report seeing things such 
; as alien spaceships, bigfoots, lake monsters, ghosts and 
; fairies, etc., etc.  And people also report being abducted, 
; taken into alien space ships and examined by the aliens.  It is 
; very unlikely that all these people are lying, yet any sensible 
; person knows that such things do not exist.  If they did, 
; especially with so many cameras everywhere, we would have solid 
; evidence.
; 
; So where are the bigfoot bodies?  Where are the unambiguous 
; photos of alien space ships?  Where are the ghost photos that 
; look like something more than a condensation cloud?  Where are 
; the recorded spirit voices that sound like more than static?
; 
; Absolutely everyone who reports experiencing something that 
; science implies is impossible cannot be lying, mistaken or 
; deluded.  What do these contradictions mean?  The contradictions 
; are good ideas for topics of future discussions however.  I'll 
; take them one at a time with no guarantee of making anyone, 
; especially born again believers or born again skeptics, happy.
