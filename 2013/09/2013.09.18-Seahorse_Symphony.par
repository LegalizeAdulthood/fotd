; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- September 17, 2013 (Rating A-8,M-8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's striking image combines four parts of straight Z with 
; three parts of Z^2, two parts of Z^3 and only one part of Z^4 on 
; each iteration before adding straight C.  This whimsical 
; assemblage of numbers creates a parent fractal that is basically 
; a classic Mandelbrot set.  This M-set however is surrounded by a 
; vast cloud of satellite dots, each of which is an entire fractal 
; universe.  Today's scene is located in one of these island 
; universes in the interior of the north branch of Seahorse Valley 
; of the parent M-set.
; 
; The terraced effect was created by rendering the image with the 
; outside set to 'tdis', which measures the total distance a point 
; travels before it escapes over the fractal horizon.
; 
; The critical point of today's concoction was rather easy to 
; find.  When the first rough approximation registered -0.9998..., 
; it was a pretty sure sign that the exact critical point is 
; likely minus-1, a common critical point.  When I entered this 
; value, it proved to be correct.
; 
; The art and math values both rate an 8, at least in my opinion.  
; The rather slow calculation time of 3-1/2 minutes is a drawback 
; however, though the web sites can take care of this time problem.
; 
; Checking the following web sites will save time.

; 
; A cloudless sky and a temperature of 66F 19C made today near 
; perfect for the end of summer here at Fractal Central.  The 
; fractal cat must have thought so as he sat on his scratching 
; post and pondered the pigeons feeding in the back yard.  The 
; humans spent the day wondering what is wrong with the world.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the right divine time.  Until 
; the deity speaks, take care, and when a man kills 12 people with 
; a gun, blame the gun, then try to get the politicians to pass 
; legislation that would reduce the number of mass shootings.  
; (I'll have much more to say about such simple minded thinking in 
; a day or two.)
