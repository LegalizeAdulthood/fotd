; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- September 02, 2013 (Rating A-7,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's deep toned and rather depressing fractal is a venture 
; into one of the rogue zexpe fractals -- the one that appears 
; when the expression Z^(epsilon)+C is iterated 9999 levels up the 
; complex hyperladder with no function applied.
; 
; The parent fractal appears as a fairly conventional zexpe 
; fractal, with the expected two large period-2 buds.  But it is 
; rotated a bit clockwise and surrounded by much smaller minizexpe 
; fractals disconnected from the main body.  Today's scene is 
; located in what appears to be an East Valley of the largest 
; satellite minizexpe, which lies just south of the southwest 
; period-2 bud of the main zexpe.
; 
; I named the image "Purple Pancakes", not a very appetizing name 
; but fully appropriate when one attempts to count all the purple 
; blotches scattered about the scene.
; 
; The art and math ratings are unexceptional, since the image's 
; tricks have already been done many times in the past.  The image 
; is still totally new however, and well worth the 1-1/2 minutes 
; required to rename and run this letter as a parameter file.  Of 
; course, the nuisance of running the parameter file may be 
; avoided by checking the finished image on one of the web sites.

; 
; Typical summer weather prevailed here at Fractal Central today, 
; with a mix of sun and clouds, a temperature of 90F 32C, high 
; humidity and the expected thunder clouds in sight, though not at 
; FC.  The fractal cat made the most of things by sleeping and 
; eating.  The humans, who had their holiday on Friday, kept watch 
; on things.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the foreseeable future.  Check 
; at regular intervals, because who knows? the future might be 
; tomorrow.  Until whenever, take care, and when things are going 
; wrong, forget the bright side of things with the associated 
; positive attitude.  It's a lot of unfounded wishful thinking.  
; Get with reality, forget the feel-good dreams, develop an honest 
; negative attitude, and look for the dark side.
