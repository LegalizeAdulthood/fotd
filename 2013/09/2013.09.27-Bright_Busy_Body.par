; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- September 27, 2013 (Rating A-8,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us back to yesterday's Julibrot though not 
; to yesterday's parent fractal.  Today's parent results when 
; yesterday's expression is calculated with Z initialized to the 
; second critical point of the expression, which is 0.225...  And 
; like yesterday's parent fractal, today's is also indescribable, 
; though unlike yesterday's it has X-axis symmetry.
; 
; The closest I can come to describing this parent is to call it 
; part of a Mandelbrot set with its west half mostly covered by 
; debris.  Today's scene lies in the northern branch of an 
; apparent Seahorse Valley.  I see a lot of East Valley type stuff 
; in it however.
; 
; The image is unusually brilliant and filled with an incredible 
; amount of detail.  This inspired the name "Bright Busy-Body", 
; which does not imply an intelligent old lady who puts her nose 
; into everyone's affairs.
; 
; The artistic worth of 8 exceeds the math value of 6, while the 
; calculation time of 6 minutes is admittedly excessive.  This 
; excessive time is where the web sites will rush to the rescue.
; 
; To see the image without the annoying chore of calculating it, 
; check the official FOTD web site, where the non-fractal 
; political and philosophical stuff will also be posted whenever I 
; feel like writing some.  The official site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The finished image is also posted at the following sites:

; 
; The weather was perfect here at Fractal Central today.  Even the 
; usual early morning fog failed to appear, leaving a mostly sunny 
; day with a temperature of 72F 22C.  The fractal cat enjoyed the 
; comfortable conditions so much that he fell asleep in the chair 
; that is both his favorite and my favorite, while the humans did 
; the dull boring things humans do to fill the days of life.
; 
; The next FOTD will most likely not be posted until Sep. 29, two 
; days from today.  Until the exact moment arrives, take care, and 
; eventually, one of those TV doomsday shows will be right.  So 
; have a good day while you can.
