; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- September 20, 2013 (Rating A-6,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the same parent fractal as yesterday's, 
; but it is located far from the area where yesterday's was found. 
; Today's image lies in a field of debris in the northwest 
; quadrant of the parent, just north of the X-axis where the axis 
; intersects the western edge of the football-shaped main bay.
; 
; I named the image "Sandy Symmetry" when I noticed that the large 
; minibrot is symmetrical with respect to its center.  The most 
; unusual aspect is that, despite the symmetry of the minibrot, 
; the lower iteration parts of the surrounding pattern have no 
; symmetry at all.
; 
; With more time, I might have found a better color palette for 
; the image.  As it is, I could rate the art aspect no higher than 
; a modest 6.  But at a rating of an above-average 7, the math 
; aspect takes some of the sting out of the missing artistic worth.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes will seem to pass faster 
; when there is some other activity to fill the wait.  The fastest 
; way of all to view the image is to check the web sites.
; 
; The completed image is available on the web sites at:

; 
; Early morning fog gave way to partly cloudy skies by 10am here 
; at Fractal Central, with an afternoon temperature of 79F 26C.  
; The fractal cat slept through most of the fine weather, 
; wondering why the humans were so busy doing unnecessary human 
; things.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear almost by magic in the appropriate 
; time.  Until that time arrives, take care, and the U.S. is not 
; only the most frightening nation on earth, it is also apparently 
; the most frightened.  (I do not call our country 'America' 
; because this is the name of the continent.)
; 
; But what are we so frightened of that makes so many of us turn 
; our homes into virtual armories and respond with such anger when 
; we hear anything that might reduce free access to guns?  I doubt 
; that any other country would be able to defeat our military 
; forces and turn us into slaves without destroying themselves and 
; the entire planet in the process.
; 
; As I see it, we are basically frightened of our mortality, which 
; is the underlying fear infesting our modern technologically 
; advanced but spiritually bankrupt culture!  The other threats 
; simply serve as things that make our spiritual fears appear 
; more concrete and rational.  I will have more to say about this 
; curious situation in future discussions.
