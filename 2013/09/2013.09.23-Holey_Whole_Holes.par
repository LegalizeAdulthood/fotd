; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- September 23, 2013 (Rating A-8,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fancy minibrot lies in the parent fractal that comes 
; about when various portions of Z^(1), Z^(2), Z^(3) and Z^(4) are 
; combined on each iteration when Z has been initialized to the 
; critical point of -2.028...
; 
; This parent consists of an obviously critical though distorted 
; Mandelbrot set in the normal orientation, with two large lobes 
; sprouting from its East Valley area, pointing northeast and 
; southeast.  These extra lobes appear definitely non-critical, 
; but they are surrounded by debris strings, which if searched, 
; reveal curious critical areas.  Today's scene lies in a string 
; of this debris near the north end of the northeast lobe.
; 
; The art rating of an 8 is mostly due to the coloring.  It did 
; take a bit of time to work up the color palette and apply it to 
; the image.  The math rating of a 7 is average.  Nothing really 
; new appears in the image or formula.
; 
; The name "Holey Whole Holes" is admittedly silly, but before 
; fractals were discovered, was the idea itself of so much from so 
; little not considered silly?
; 
; The calculation time is a nice even two minutes
; 
; The official FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The finished image plus variations is also available at the 
; following three sites:

; 
;   <http://user.xmission.com/~legalize/fractals/fotd/about.html>
; 
; Morning clouds gave way to some afternoon sun here at Fractal 
; Central today, while the temperature of 63F 17C kept the proper 
; autumn feel in the air.  The fractal cat would have preferred a 
; bit less autumn.  The humans had an average day, which means 
; busy but uneventful.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear, that much is sure.  The exact time of 
; the appearance is the question.  Until the moment of appearance 
; arrives, take care, and from now on, the daily opinion, if any, 
; will appear in the version of the FOTD discussion posted to the 
; official FOTD web site.
