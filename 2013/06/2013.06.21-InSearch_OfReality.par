; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- June 20.2013 (Rating A-7,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is evaporated, which means that all the 'outside' 
; stuff, from which the points eventually will escape, has 
; vanished and been replaced by a screen consisting of totally 
; 'inside' stuff, from which no points will ever escape.  This bit 
; of mayhem is a result of the ridiculous bailout radius of 
; 10^100, better known as one-googol, which has been set by the 
; imag(p3) parameter.
; 
; A flat screenfull of all-inside stuff can be quite boring, but 
; the active inside fills can often bring these 'dead' images to 
; life.  In today's image the 'bof61' fill does the job.
; 
; The formula behind the madness subtracts 2.72 parts of Z^(-2.7) 
; from 8.5 parts of Z^(-1.6) then adds (1/C) on each iteration.  
; This creates a parent fractal with X-axis symmetry, which 
; resembles a Mandelbrot set rotated 180 degrees with its west end 
; facing east and its normal east end replaced by a large open 
; bay.  A kind of double crescent moon lies in this open area, and 
; today's scene lies in one of these crescents.
; 
; The name "In Search of Reality" does not refer to one of the 
; current crop of contrived 'reality' TV shows.  It refers to the 
; questionable reality of things like fractals, sub-atomic 
; particles, and of course ghosts.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes is slow enough to make the 
; calculation a bother.  But the web sites can bring a miracle 
; cure.
; 
; Forget about calculating the image on that DOS-challenged 
; machine.  Let me be the one who does the work.  Check the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition rendering is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Back images without limit are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The weather was near perfect here at Fractal Central today, with 
; a temperature of 82F 28C and a Photoshop-blue sky decorated with 
; the kind of clouds that have faces in them.  The fractal cat 
; slept all afternoon while the humans went on a short trip in the 
; surrounding countryside.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted before too long, most likely within 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and skeptics know that truly 
; paranormal things such as ghosts are all in the mind.  At the 
; same time, some people have already experienced the paranormal.  
; But it's a trick of their minds, and they must be shown their 
; understandable mistakes.  To hear scientific claims that make 
; ghosts and hauntings seem like everyday normality, they should 
; talk with a cosmologist or a physicist.
