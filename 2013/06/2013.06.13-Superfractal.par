; FOTD -- June 13, 2013 (Rating A-7,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Look up in the sky!  It's a bird, it's a plane, it's 
; Superfractal, complete with its superinsignia on its chest.  
; Well, actually, it's an Oblate view of one of the strange 
; rectangles in the East Valley of the split main minibrot on the 
; negative X-axis of the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid.
; 
; Today's image might not be faster than a bullet, more powerful 
; than a locomotive, or able to leap tall buildings in a single 
; bound, but if it had appeared in the 1930's, around the time the 
; other superhero did, it would have been considered super indeed.
; 
; My opinion of the image's artistic worth is in the range of a 7, 
; while the math worth rates a humdrum 5.  The math aspect might 
; have rated a point or two higher if so many similar rectangles 
; had not appeared so many times before.
; 
; The name "Superfractal" came to mind when I saw a stylized 
; letter 'S' in the image.  The 'S' consists of what remains of 
; the open area of the curious Julia rectangle.
; 
; Requiring a wait of 8-1/2 minutes, the calculation time is slow, 
; there is no doubt of that.  But the wait can be eliminated by 
; checking the web sites.
; 
; The image has been rendered and posted to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Hi-def versions are at:

; 
; The back images are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day began with a bang as a heavy thunder-storm broke out 
; here at Fractal Central.  When the storm ended, the rest of the 
; day brought lots of clouds and a few light showers.  With a 
; little sun mixed in and a temperature of 79F 26C, it was still a 
; pleasant day however.  The fractal cat, who did not like the 
; thunder, braved the storm nevertheless in his favorite chair.  
; The humans noted that the additional 1.15 inches, 3cm, of rain 
; was too much of a good thing for the fractal garden, which is 
; becoming rather waterlogged.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted when the bull cows come home.  
; Until whenever these apparent hermaphrodites arrive, take care, 
; and keep affirming that there are no aliens from space secretly 
; running the mess we've worked ourselves into here on earth.  
; After a while, you might actually start to believe yourself.
