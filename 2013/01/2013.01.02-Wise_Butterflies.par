; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- January 02, 2013 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image continues the theme of yesterday's, with a shift 
; upward to an exponent of (-6.01).  Since the image is so close 
; to being a repeat, I could not give it an equally high rating, 
; but the rating of 8-1/2 that I did give it is not to be sneezed 
; at.
; 
; I named the image "Wise Butterflies".  I can give no logical 
; reason for such a name.  It is simply a phrase that popped into 
; my mind when I shut off my thinking for a few minutes as I 
; studied the image.
; 
; The calculation time of 12 seconds seems unreal.  But that's the 
; time it took for the image to finish on the now ancient 2000mhz 
; unit.  It will take longer than this to set up and run the 
; included parameter file.
; 
; Save the effort of setting up the parameter file by viewing the 
; finished image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; And check the hi-def variations at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Thousands of back images are posted at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A mix of sun and clouds prevailed here at Fractal Central today, 
; while the temperature of freezing made it feel quite seasonal.  
; The fractal cat spent the afternoon on the shelf in the 
; southwest window while the sun was out, and near the heat when 
; the sun was obscured.  The semi-fractal humans had a back-to-
; work day, which was notably un-exciting.
; 
; I hear that some people were disappointed when the world did not 
; end on December 21.  As for myself, I could not have been 
; disappointed, because I was virtually certain that nothing would 
; happen on doomsday.  All predictions of doomsday through all of 
; history have had one thing in common -- they have been wrong.  
; And I saw no reason to expect the latest 'Mayan' doomsday to be 
; any different.  IMO, our whole culture is the doomsday scene.
; 
; I am pretty much a skeptic about most of the strange and unusual 
; things we are given on TV as likely fact.  This includes alien 
; spacecraft visiting earth, alien abductions, bigfoots wandering 
; our forests, lake and other monsters, Bermuda triangles, 
; assorted conspiracy theories, and most other things that make no 
; sense.  But this does not mean I am a totally boring rational 
; thinker.  I do believe in ghosts and invisible 'spirit' worlds, 
; which puts me right up there among the irrational kooks.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted soon.  Until that earth-shattering 
; moment arrives, take care, and don't give up all hope of 
; doomsday destruction.  The media moguls ordaining the public 
; mood will soon invent another looming doomsday for us to worry 
; about.
