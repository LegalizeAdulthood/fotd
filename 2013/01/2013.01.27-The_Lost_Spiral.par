; FOTD -- January 27, 2013 (Rating 7+)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a slice of a spiral that lies in the 
; Seahorse Valley area of the Z^2+C Julibrot, a fact that is 
; confirmed by the name "The Lost Spiral".  But the image holds no 
; spiral.  Instead, it shows a series of concentric rings which 
; break apart into two separate spirals near the center.
; 
; So what is wrong here?  Where is the spiral?  Actually, we are 
; looking at a slice of it.  Everything in the image is a part of 
; the same great spiral, but sliced in an odd direction.  Fractal 
; spirals are four-dimensional things that twist and turn in 
; unimaginable ways, and when sliced in odd directions can produce 
; the most unusual cross-sections.
; 
; The full 4-D 'object' that is sliced by today's image does not 
; actually appear on the screen.  It lies in the nearby hyper-
; space.  The two small spirals at the center are actually two 
; slices of the same hyper-object, which is twisted in 4-D space 
; so that today's image slices through it two times, exactly as 
; a slice through the center of a single donut would produce two 
; apparently separate circles.  The outer rings correspond to the 
; rings produced by a slice through a set of nested spheres.
; 
; The image rates a little over a 7.  The plus sign is due to the 
; minor math interest, which adds very little to the artistic 
; worth.
; 
; Incidentally, the image has been stretched and skewed to a 
; significant degree to clarify the features.
; 
; The coloring detail of the image was created by rendering it 
; with the outside set to 'tdis'.
; 
; I would be the first to agree that the calculation time of 7-1/2 
; minutes is slow.
; 
; Have no worry when nothing appears on the screen for a minute or 
; two.  It takes a while for the calculation to reach the rings, 
; which do not intersect the edges of the frame.  All these 
; problems can be avoided however by visiting the web sites.
; 
; The fastest way to view the spiral fragment is to view it on the 
; official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; High definition variations are posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Though with such slow images as we have had recently, there 
; might be a delay in calculating and posting them.
; 
; The historic back images are available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day here at Fractal Central began with a very chilly temper-
; ature of +5F -15C.  But with clear skies, light winds and an 
; unusually strong sun, it rose to an afternoon high of a rather 
; pleasant freezing.  The fractal cat took full advantage of the 
; sun, spending the entire afternoon on his shelf in the southwest 
; window.  The humans, meanwhile, took it as easy as possible.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a minimum of 24 hours, a maximum 
; of who knows what.  Until whenever arrives, take care, and first 
; we have inventions, then the inventions become luxuries, and 
; then the luxuries become one more technology-based necessity 
; that we could not possibly survive without.
