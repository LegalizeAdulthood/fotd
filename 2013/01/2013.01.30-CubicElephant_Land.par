; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- January 30, 2013 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's semi-glorious image is a simple view of a cubic minibrot 
; in the eastern Elephant Valley of the Z^3+C Mandeloid.  (The 
; parent fractal also has an elephant-type valley on the west side 
; of the main bay, but this valley simply mirrors the eastern one.)
; 
; I chose this particular minibrot because it is a good example of 
; anti-trifurcation, and also because it is an unusually 
; impressive scene in the cubic Mandeloid.
; 
; The rating of 7-1/2 includes an extra half-point as a reward for 
; the extra effort I put into the flashy coloring.
; 
; The name "Cubic Elephant Land" is a comment on the exponent of Z 
; and also the cubic elephants that abound all through the scene.
; 
; The calculation time of 40 seconds is fast by anyone's 
; standards, but the FOTD web sites are always available to make 
; the operation even simpler.
; 
; Be happy!  View the image already calculated at:

; 
; The heavy clouds hung on here at Fractal Central today, inter-
; spersed with heavy showers of rain.  The temperature reached a 
; spring-like 64F 18C but could not be enjoyed with rain falling 
; so frequently.  Nicholas, the fractal cat, checked the weather 
; outside several times, but spent most of the day asking for more 
; food.  The humans, being human, did human things.
; 
; The next FOTD will eventually be posted, most likely sooner 
; rather than later.  Until whenever, take care, and regardless of 
; how bleak the outlook might be, remember that it could always 
; take a turn for the worse.  (Then try to think positive.)
