; FOTD -- February 13, 2013 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To create today's image, I combined 10 negative parts of 
; Z^(-1.6) with 2 negative parts of Z^(-3.7) and added (1/C) on 
; each iteration.  When the calculation was finished, I found 
; myself with a parent fractal that was little more than a large 
; irregular open hole with Mandelbrot features along its southern 
; boundary and a large cloverleaf object floating inside its 
; northern part.  I found today's scene when I checked the eastern 
; edge of the obviously Mandelbrot stuff on the southern boundary 
; of the large irregular hole.
; 
; The name "Nothing Much" describes what I found there.  But 
; 'nothing much' implies a little something, and a little 
; something is what we find in today's image, which is perhaps 
; most notable for its well-divided areas that are unusually flat. 
; Actually, these flat areas would have been nearly totally flat 
; if I had not used the 'tdis' outside option when rendering the 
; scene.
; 
; As it is, the image rates a nominal 7, good enough to be worth 
; the 2-1/4 minutes required to calculate it.  Curiously, I think 
; this is the first image in which I have used a negative maxiter 
; with the 'tdis' outside.
; 
; The finished image is posted online at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; High-definition versions are at:

; The FOTD back images are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A cloudy day with a temperature of 41F +5C ended with a burst of 
; wet snow at nightfall.  The snow never amounted to more than an 
; inch (2cm) however, and by midnight, had ended.  The fractal cat 
; had an average day for an indoor cat.  (Indoor cats live far less 
; exciting but far safer lives than the stray and feral cats that 
; roam the area.)  The humans had an average human day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in approximately 36 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and I hear that our schools now need far more 
; computers and internet access in the classrooms if they hope to 
; do an adequate job of teaching students.  But if this is so, 
; how, in primitive classrooms without computers, did we learn 
; enough to develop the present day computers that have now become 
; so necessary?
