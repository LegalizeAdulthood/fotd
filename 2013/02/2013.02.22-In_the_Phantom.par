; FOTD -- February 21, 2013 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in yesterday's 'phantom' parent 
; fractal, which was revealed by switching the value of initial Z 
; of the Feb. 18 image to the second critical value of the 
; generating function, which is -1.  The location is near a larger 
; minibrot in a tiny valley on the western shore line of the large 
; western bay of today's parent.
; 
; Today's parent fractal, which appeared as yesterday's FOTD, is 
; quite unusual.  It is filled with minibrots, but the minibrots 
; are not the expected quadratic variety as they are in the other 
; parent fractal of today's function.  Instead, as is illustrated 
; in today's image, they appear to be of an order somewhere around 
; 2.5.  Actually, today's entire parent is strange, and deserves a 
; more careful examination, which I will do in the next few days.
; 
; The rating of an 8 is divided half-and-half between mathematical 
; interest and fractal artistic value.  The name "In the Phantom" 
; describes the location of today's scene -- in a fractal that 
; first appeared as a buried 'phantom' fractal in the background 
; of the image for February 18.
; 
; The calculation time of 6-1/2 minutes is slow.  Checking the web 
; sites can cut the wait to seconds.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>

; 
; A mix of sun and clouds, complete with a few flakes of snow, 
; made today a typical sample of midwinter weather here at Fractal 
; Central.  The temperature of 34F +1C was almost exactly average 
; for the day.  The fractal cat spent several hours on the shelf 
; in the southwest window, trying to enjoy the off-and-on sun, 
; while the humans passed the day working.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted, that much is certain.  The only question is exactly when 
; it will be posted.  Until whenever, take care, and have fun.
