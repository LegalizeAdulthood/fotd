; FOTD -- February 08, 2013 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a quadratic minibrot surrounded by its 
; typical bifurcating pattern of elements.  But wait!  Something 
; is wrong.  The minibrot must be some kind of circus freak.  It 
; bears very little resemblance to a typical quadratic minibrot.
; 
; The reason is that it is not a pure quadratic minibrot.  The 
; minibrot has been caught in the process of morphing from a 
; quadratic to an order-11 one.
; 
; On its surface, the parent fractal, once you back out far enough 
; to see all of it, is a hugely oversized Mandelbrot set.  But in 
; its depths, it is corrupted by order-eleven energies.  Today's 
; image lies in an elephant trunk on the south shore line of the 
; parent, at a depth where the order-eleven corruption is just 
; beginning to wreak its havoc on the minibrots.
; 
; Finding nothing really outstanding in the image, I could rate it 
; no higher than a hum-drum average 7.  The colors are blended 
; smoothly enough, but at least in my opinion, they lack harmony.
; 
; The name "Something is Awry" describes the hopelessly corrupted 
; minibrot at the center.  The calculation time of only one minute 
; is quite brief however, and will cause little frustration for 
; those who feel the image has laid an egg.
; 
; The finished image is posted online at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>

; High-definition renderings of the FOTD images are posted at:

; 
; Heavy clouds prevailed all morning here at Fractal Central, 
; making the ominous media forecast of a super-blizzard seem all 
; the more ominous.  But as of post time, the temperature is a 
; rather balmy 37F +3C and nothing has yet fallen from the clouds. 
; I'm beginning to suspect another gross exaggeration from the 
; profit-driven weather media.  The fractal cat must agree.  All 
; day, he has been notably unconcerned with the weather.  The 
; humans are mildly concerned, but expect little more weather 
; action than a mildly inconvenient inch or two of slush, if even 
; that.
; 
; The next image will be posted in a couple days, but with nothing 
; guaranteed.  Until whenever, take care, and we should be ready 
; to accept the truth even when it proves to be something we do 
; not want.
