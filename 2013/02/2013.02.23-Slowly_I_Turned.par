; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- February 22, 2013 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Slowly I Turned".  The name has nothing 
; to do with the image.  It is actually a phrase from an old 
; Abbott and Costello comedy skit.  Those aged enough to be 
; considered venerable will remember the movie.  The rest must 
; forever wonder why the phrase was so funny.
; 
; Today's image is no joke however.  It shows a Z^(2.3) minibrot 
; in the phantom parent fractal of two days ago.  This parent 
; consists of a large three-lobed central bay with smaller bays on 
; the west and east and west ends.  Today's image is located in a 
; blunt valley on the western edge of a bud on the northwest edge 
; of the western lobe of the large central bay. 
; 
; The rating of 7-1/2 indicates an image just slightly above 
; average.  The calculation time of 11-1/2 minutes is very slow, 
; making a trip to one of the web sites by far the better choice.
; 
; Much time may be saved by viewing the finished image on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Variations in high-definition are or soon will be posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; If the variations are not yet posted, it is because some of the 
; hi-def variations can be quite time consuming to generate.
; 
; The many thousands of FOTD back images are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day dawned clear, but clouds moved in as the sun rose, and 
; the rest of the day was cloudy with a temperature of 32F 0Z and 
; a few light flurries of snow.  The fractal cat quit the window 
; shelf as soon as he saw the lack of sun.  The humans had a busy 
; day.  With too much work and both of us feeling under average, 
; testiness prevailed.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted when the time is right, and there 
; is a good chance that might not be for two days.  Until then, 
; take care, and everyone knows the solutions to the nation's 
; problems.  Why then have the problems not yet been solved?
