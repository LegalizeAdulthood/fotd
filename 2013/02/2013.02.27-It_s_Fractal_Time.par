; FOTD -- February 27, 2013 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Since the flu shot did not work this year, we are both still 
; feeling lethargic from the flu here at FC today, which means the 
; discussion will be brief.
; 
; I named the image "It's Fractal Time" because even after 24 
; years, fractals are still fun.  The rating of 7-1/2 indicates my 
; lack of real enthusiasm for the image.
; 
; Today's scene is another dive into yesterday's parent fractal.  
; Today we check very deep into the East Valley area of a minibrot 
; on the northeast edge of the parent's prominent 'fan'.
; 
; These fractal fans almost always appear with the 'handle' 
; pointing west and the open blade to the east.  They are common 
; in fractals that combine two negative powers of Z, but rarely 
; appear in other fractals.
; 
; Due to its extreme magnitude, the calculation time of the image 
; is a slow 9 minutes, almost all of which may be saved by 
; checking the web sites.
; 
; So relieve all stress and calculation anxieties by viewing the 
; finished image on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Variations in hi-def are available at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And thousands of FOTD back images are available at>
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Rain fell all night and morning here at Fractal Central today.  
; The afternoon remained cloudy with a temperature of 45F +7C.  
; Nicholas, the fractal cat, gave up on the sun well before noon, 
; but then laid claim to my favorite TV chair, from which he would 
; not be dislodged.  The humans meanwhile made it through another 
; unpromising day.
; 
; The next FOTD *will* be posted, that much is clear, what is in 
; doubt is the exact time it will be posted.  My best guess is in 
; 24 hours.  Until whenever, take care, and if the Catholic Church 
; ever starts changing its standpoint, who knows where the changes 
; will stop?  Maybe the church will go so far as to admit that its 
; most important articles of faith such as the existence of God, 
; salvation and heaven are not quite as certain as it has always 
; taught.  After all, one would think that by this time science 
; would have found at least a hint of something.
