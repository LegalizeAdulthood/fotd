; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- November 04, 2013 (Rating A-7,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To create today's parent fractal I combined 1.75 negative parts 
; of Z^(-4.5) with 3 negative parts of Z^(-1.75) and added (1/C) 
; on each iteration.  Calculating with the reciprocal of C usually 
; turns the fractal inside-out, so that the negative exponents of 
; Z create a lake rather than an island.  In today's case however 
; the parent does not follow the rules, and appears as a butterfly-
; shaped island with large black spots on its wing tips.  These 
; black spots are actually bays, and today's image lies deep in 
; the northern valley of the northern bay.
; 
; My extra coloring effort raised the original humdrum rating of a 
; 5 to a respectable 7.  The math rating of a 7 is based on the 
; unusual doubly inside-out parent butterfly fractal.
; 
; The name "Christmas is Coming" is a statement of fact that can 
; be verified by a glance at the calendar.  I chose the name 
; because I felt a strong seasonal mood in the color scheme.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/3 minutes is not too bad, but it is 
; not all that great either.  Fear not.  The web sites are always 
; close at hand.
; 
; Relief from time distress may be found at the official FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted.  Classier variations are 
; available at:

; 
; The day began clear and calm, with a chilly temperature of 23F 
; -5C, and progressed through a sunny morning and partly-cloudy 
; afternoon, with a high temperature of 43F +6C.  The older 
; fractal cat, Nicholas, spent most of the time sleeping in my 
; favorite chair, while the young kitten, Jasmine, who has almost 
; recovered from her sprained arm, spent the time alternating 
; between sleeping and playing with her catnip mouse.  The humans 
; passed the day doing what humans usually do, though I'm not sure 
; average humans spend as much time on fractals as I do.
; 
; The next FOTD will most likely be posted in 24 hours.  If not, 
; it will appear in 48 hours.  Until next time, take care, and I 
; will once again place my full faith in science when it can give 
; a reasonably satisfactory reply to the question of why we exist. 
; The usual scientific reply is to claim that the question is 
; meaningless or to refer the questioner to the answers given by 
; religion, even while hypocritically implying that religious 
; belief is only a comforting superstition with no reality behind 
; it. . . .
; 
; ("We do not invent the things we say," the erudite scientists 
; loudly proclaim, "we only pass on what we find to be true.")
