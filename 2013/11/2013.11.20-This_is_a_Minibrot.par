; FOTD -- November 20, 2013 (Rating A-8,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; "This is a Minibrot"
; 
; This phrase is not only the name of today's image, but it is 
; also a harsh fact of the image.  The tiny hole at the center of 
; the scene is a minibrot in the parent fractal that came about 
; when I calculated the expression Z^sqrt(2)+C at a height of 14 
; levels up the hyperladder with no function applied.
; 
; This parent is a shapeless thing, impossible to describe in 
; words, with no resemblance at all to a recognizable Mandelbrot 
; set.  Today's image lies on a filament extending from a mis-
; shapen bud on the northeast side of the parent.
; 
; I chose sqrt(2) as the exponent of Z because the minibrots in 
; this family of fractals are sometimes surrounded by two- and 
; four-way symmetry, making them easier to find, though nowhere 
; near as easy as straight quadratic minibrots.
; 
; I sometimes wonder what separates a minibrot from the countless 
; other holes that parent fractals are often filled with.  As I 
; see it, the difference is that true minibrots do not fill in 
; regardless of how high the maxiter is raised.  Also, minibrots 
; almost always lie in a basin, with the number of surrounding 
; elements increasing without limit as the edge of the open area 
; is approached.  The other holes that fill fractals are often 
; simply random open areas that never fill in, or open areas at 
; the center of bottomless spirals that will fill in with a higher 
; maxiter.
; 
; Most minibrots are of the quadratic variety, even in fractals 
; created by a combination of exponents other than 2.  This 
; quadratic shape appears to be the generalized shape of 
; minibrots, much as parabolas are the generalized shape of curves 
; in the graphs of many functions.  Today's minibrot is of order 
; 1.414... a variety which has no generalized shape at all, and is 
; therefore quite interesting.
; 
; The art rating of an 8 shows that I am quite satisfied with the 
; colors.  The math rating of a 7 was given a boost by the colors. 
; There is little new math stuff in the image however.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes is slower than I would 
; have preferred, but the FOTD web sites can eliminate the 
; slowness.

; 
; The day began with a biting cold temperature of 23F -5C but the 
; clear sky and resulting strong sun bumped it up to 43F +6C by 
; afternoon.  The fractal cats, who are just learning to play 
; together, were too busy chasing each other up and down the 
; fractal hallway to take advantage of the afternoon sunlight 
; flooding their shelf in the southwest window.  The humans, much 
; less playful, spent the day tending to more pressing but less 
; interesting things.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted when the time is right.  Until 
; whenever that might be, take care, and I admit that fractals are 
; awesome, but are they groovy?
