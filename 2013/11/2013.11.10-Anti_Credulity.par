; 
; FOTD -- November 10, 2013 (Rating A-8.5,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image combines Z^3 with 0.333 parts of Z^5 before adding 
; straight C on each iteration.  This expression produces a parent 
; fractal that begins as the main bay of a Mandelbrot set that has 
; been rotated 90 degrees so that its normally west end faces 
; north.  I say it begins as an M-set because only the main bay is 
; close to appearing normal.
; 
; This main bay, at the southern extremity of the parent, is 
; reasonably normal, but starting with the main period-2 bud, the 
; fractal loses its M-set characteristics and an ever larger 
; series of bays takes over, becoming ever stranger the farther 
; north we go.  Today's scene lies at the entrance to a minor cove 
; on the northeast shore line of the farthest north bay, which is 
; the largest and strangest of all.
; 
; The image is most notable for its coloring, which is almost 
; totally of my own design and earns me, (at least IMO), a bonus 
; of 1.5 points, raising the total rating to a quite honorable 
; 8.5  The math however is a straightforward combination of two 
; simple exponents of Z, which holds its rating to an average 5.
; 
; The name "Anti-Credulity" is a synonym for skepticism.  It is 
; what I would have felt if someone had told me of fractals in the 
; 1960's, when I was very much alive, cranky and complaining about 
; the world's situation.  And now that I'm a septuagenarian, with 
; all the implied benefits, I have become even crankier.
; 
; Fortunately, the calculation time of only 1-1/4 minutes will 
; keep my grouchiness from spreading, and if a bit of it does 
; leak out, the web sites will make quick work of it.
; 
; To promote anti-grouchiness, the image has already been 
; calculated and posted at:

; 
; Mostly cloudy, blustery but not too chilly conditions prevailed 
; here at Fractal Central most all day, with a temperature of 52F 
; 11C.  The fractal cats had an active day, chasing each other up 
; and down the hallway until Nico grew bored and told Jasmine to 
; slow down.  The humans, meanwhile, had an average day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and the most dependable sign of the truth of an offensive 
; opinion is when it becomes politically incorrect to speak it in 
; public.
