; 
; FOTD -- November 11, 2013 (Rating A-7.5,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was created by combining 0.5 part of Z^6 with Z^3 
; and adding straight C on each iteration.  The parent fractal is 
; a large boomerang-shaped bay with X-axis symmetry, surrounded by 
; countless smaller holes.  Today's scene lies near a hole just 
; inland of the southwest shore line of the large bay.
; 
; Not surprisingly, the holes radiating from the central minibrot 
; in today's image are shaped almost exactly like the nearby 
; larger hole.  Most of the effect was achieved by rendering the 
; scene with the outside set to 'tdis', which creates the terraced 
; effect.
; 
; The name came about when I had the impression of an octopus with 
; double the number of arms, which could only be called a 
; "Hexadecapus".
; 
; The art rating of 7.5 reflects the coloring effort I put into 
; the image, with less than ideal results.  The math rating of a 5 
; shows that nothing new and unexpected is revealed in today's 
; FOTD.
; 
; The calculation time of only 35 seconds is quite fast.  Viewing 
; the finished image on the web sites is equally fast.
; 
; Make life easier by viewing the finished image plus all the 
; unexpected variations on the web sites at:

; 
; More clouds than sun prevailed here at Fractal Central today.  
; With little wind, the temperature of 50F 10C felt comfortable 
; enough, though the older fractal cat, Nicholas, would have 
; preferred more sun on the shelf in the southwest window.  The 
; fractal humans made it through the day with little happening 
; that was worth remembering.
; 
; The next FOTD will grace the list in about 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and environmentalists want to fight global 
; warming and at the same time eliminate dangerous nuclear power 
; plants.  These are worthy goals, but despite the optimistic 
; claims of the dreamers, clean renewable energy can supply only 
; a tiny part of our energy demand.
; 
; This means that to achieve a cleaner safer environment, people 
; will need to survive with much less energy.  I doubt that many 
; would be willing or able to make the necessary sacrifices, such 
; as getting rid of their motor vehicles, living without air-
; conditioning in warm humid climates, (Swamp coolers would work 
; well enough most of the time in hot dry climates.), and 
; eliminating the energy guzzling internet and mobile phone 
; networks.
; 
; And, being people who care, we would also want to help the 
; emerging nations raise their standards of living, which means we 
; would need to supply them with the necessary energy.  The 
; question is, with fossil and nuclear energy no longer available, 
; and our own energy demand continuing to increase, where would 
; the additional energy to help the underpriviliged but emerging 
; nations come from?
