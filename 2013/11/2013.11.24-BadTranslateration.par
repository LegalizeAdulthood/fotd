; 
; FOTD -- November 24, 2013 (Rating A-6,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the parent fractal that results when the 
; expression Z^(1.85)+C is iterated 0.5094505 part of one level up 
; the hyperladder.  I picked this odd height because it produces a 
; fractal that almost has X-axis symmetry, not that it makes much 
; difference in the resulting fractal.  (Since the symmetry is 
; illusional, X-axis symmetry, which appears right, will not work 
; with today's particular parameters.)
; 
; This parent fractal resembles a Mandelbrot set with its west 
; half cut off and its East Valley split into two halves.  Today's 
; scene lies on the north shoreline of the northern East Valley.
; 
; The name "Bad Translateration" might refer to some abstruse 
; point of advanced matrix math, with deep philosophical 
; ramifications involving reality.  Actually, it means nothing.
; 
; The nearly shapeless minibrot at the center bears little 
; resemblance to any kind of M-set, while the overall pattern is 
; far too haphazard, with no central theme.  As a result, the art 
; value is an unimpressive 6, while the math stuff, which has 
; often been seen before, rates no higher than a humdrum 5.
; 
; To make things worse, the calculation time of over 5 minutes 
; will lead to impatience in those so prone.  My solution to the 
; problem is to rush to the web sites.
; 
; View the finished image on the web sites without the chore of 
; doing the calculation.  The sites may be accessed at:

; 
; The mostly sunny skies here at Fractal Central today were 
; spoiled by a temperature of 23F -5C and a biting northwest wind. 
; The fractal cats spent the day being glad they were inside.  The 
; fractal humans spent the day doing the things humans do indoors 
; on a cold Sunday afternoon.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in probably 24 hours.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and we should feel sorry for the liberal 
; environmentalists, who care about both the environment and the 
; underprivileged.  I have rarely seen anyone in such a dilemma.  
; They say the world must cut its carbon emissions, and at the 
; same time help the emerging nations achieve a better standard of 
; living.
