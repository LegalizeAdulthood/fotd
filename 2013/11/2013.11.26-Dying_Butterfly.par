; FOTD -- November 26, 2013 (Rating A-9,M-8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In yesterday's discussion I said that the day's fractal was 
; filled with hard to find minibrots.  But difficulty is no 
; put-off for me when it comes to finding fractals.  Using the 
; 'fmod' method, I found a minibrot on the first inzoom.  Today's 
; image shows that minibrot.  In the upcoming FOTD's I will show 
; several more minibrots that are equally unlikely.
; 
; The minibrot lies in the large field of debris extending 
; southwest from the tooth-shaped open area of yesterday's 
; fractal.  The fuzziness is partly due to the inherent fuzzy 
; nature of the minibrot itself and partly due to a curious 
; breakdown of resolution in the area immediately surrounding the 
; minibrot.  Those using fractal programs with better resolution 
; might be able to clear away part or perhaps all of the fuzziness.
; 
; In my opinion, the art rating of a 9 is justified.  And due to 
; the unexpected complexity of the minibrot, the math rating of an 
; 8 is also justified.
; 
; The name "Dying Butterfly" describes the first thing I saw in 
; the image.
; 
; The calculation time of 4 minutes is on the slow side.  But the 
; web sites are always there to speed things up to instantly.
; 
; The finished image is posted online at:

;

; 
; Today was unpleasant from dawn to dusk here at Fractal Central.  
; The day began with light snow, which piled up about 3cm before 
; changing to rain in the afternoon, while the temperature slowly 
; rose from 30F -1C to 34F +1C.  The fractal cats took a few peeks 
; at the slush outside but spent most of the day sleeping and 
; playing.  The new fractal cat Jasmine, (we call her Jazzy), is 
; developing into quite an athletic little feline, leaping a meter 
; (3 feet) into the air after her dragonfly toy.  The old fractal 
; cat Nicholas, (we call him Nico), wonders where she gets all her 
; energy.  The fractal people spent the day watching the ice come 
; and go.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the proper time.  Since I have 
; no idea what time might be proper, I can give no exact time.  
; Until whenever the proper time arrives, take care, and no one is 
; perfect.  People should expect only lies and disappointment from 
; the politicians they choose to be leaders.  So to avoid future 
; disappointment, expect nothing, as I did 5 years ago.  A nega-
; tive attitude might be unpleasant, but it is all too often 
; correct.
