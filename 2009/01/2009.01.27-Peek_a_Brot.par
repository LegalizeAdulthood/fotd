; FOTD -- January 28, 2008 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's lively little image came about when one part of Z^3 was 
; subtracted from three parts of Z^2.  The resulting parent 
; fractal is a slightly under-sized Mandelbrot set located just 
; beyond the left edge of the opening frame and rotated 180 
; degrees so that its negative spike is now a positive spike, (at 
; least it's pointing in a positive direction), and its East 
; Valley is now a West Valley.  There is little out of the 
; ordinary about the details of the parent fractal except for a 
; scattering of disconnected extra stuff beyond both the positive 
; (negative) spike and West (East) Valley.  Today's image is a 
; scene deep in the most distant bit of debris in the scattering 
; of debris west of West (East) Valley.
; 
; When rendered in the 'normal' manner, with the 'normal' equal-
; iteration bands, the scene is dull indeed, but when rendered 
; with the outside set to 'fmod', the scene really comes to life.  
; The entire image has been rotated 180 degrees to return the 
; parent fractal and the minibrot at the center of the image to 
; the normal position, with the spike pointing west.  This is a 
; self-imposed rule that I usually follow.
; 
; I rated the image at an 8-1/2 which includes a half-point reward 
; for the coloring, which gets something from nothing.  To see the 
; 'nothing' change the outside from 'fmod' to 'iter'.  The name 
; "Peek-a-Brot" must have some significance, but at the moment I 
; can see very little reason for it.
; 
; The very brief calculation time of 18 seconds can be made even 
; briefer by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Still proud of catching the mouse on Monday, the fractal cats 
; stood tall here at Fractal Central on Tuesday.  The lack of sun, 
; the threat of snow, and the temperature of 27F -3C, didn't worry 
; them a bit.  My day was about average.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours, which is the average time between FOTD 
; postings.  Until then, take care, and never stop searching for 
; the ultimate fractal.
