; FOTD -- January 29, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Since today's image is more of an experiment than an effort at 
; fractal art, I decided to give it no rating.  The parent fractal 
; is a grotesquely bloated Mandelbrot set with order-1000001 under-
; tones.  Today's image lies in one of the elephant trunks in East 
; Valley.
; 
; I named the image "Crouching Minibrot" because part of it is 
; occupied by a hidden minibrot.  The black area at the right side 
; of the image is the edge of a minibrot of order 1,000,001.  This 
; means it has exactly one-million similar bays around its peri-
; meter, which caused me to open my desktop calculator.
; 
; Since only four bays appear in the image, this means that only 
; 1/250,000 of the total circumference of the minibrot appears on 
; the screen.  On my screen the four bays extend over a distance 
; of 30cm or one foot, which means that the total circumference of 
; the minibrot must be 250,000 feet or 7,500,000cm.  Dividing this 
; distance by 3.14159 we determine that, at the same scale, the 
; diameter of the minibrot whose edge appears at the right side of 
; today's image must be near 2,400,000cm or 24km, which is near 15 
; miles.  It's quite a minibrot.
; 
; To see the entire circular minibrot, turn off the logmap and 
; reduce the magnitude of the image to 1,000,000.
; 
; Perhaps the most curious thing in the image lies in the peninsu-
; las that separate the bays, where the same pattern repeats, only 
; very slowly changing from one peninsula to the next.  I see much 
; stuff for investigation here.
; 
; Despite all the weirdness, the image calculates in only 1-3/4 
; minutes, about the time required to visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and appreciate the finished experiment there.
; 
; Snow, sleet and freezing rain made for a most unpleasant day 
; here at Fractal Central on Wednesday.  The temperature of 30F 
; -1C only added to the unpleasantness.  But strangely, the 
; fractal cats seemed to enjoy the day, watching the neighborhood 
; snow removal activities from their window shelf, with obvious 
; fascination.
; 
; My day would have been pleasant had it not been for the task of 
; clearing the fractal sidewalks.  Five inches of sleet is quite 
; heavy to move around.  If nothing worse happens, the next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and I wonder 
; what the world is really made of.
