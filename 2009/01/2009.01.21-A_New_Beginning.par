; FOTD -- January 21, 2009 (Rating Optimistic)
; 
; Fractal and political visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I posted yesterday's FOTD, I was feeling irritated because 
; of the frozen sink drain.  Then when I read the e-mail claiming 
; that I had directed the members of the list to an AOL web site 
; about the inauguration, I wrote a hasty reply and struck the 
; send button before counting to 10.  Actually, AOL itself adds 
; these little perks at the bottom of all its overpriced e-mails.
; 
; But I was rather surprised by some of the replies to my hasty 
; response, especially those that expressed disappointment with 
; my opinion of what the new administration might achieve.
; 
; For one thing, I fail to see the connection between the search 
; for beauty and my opinion of the ability of the new administra-
; tion to solve the country's problems.  (If I am wrong, and I 
; could easily be wrong, and the hoped-for miracles actually are 
; brought about, I will be the first to admit my mistake.)
; 
; I believe I have amply shown my appreciation of fractal beauty 
; in the thousands of fractals I have posted to this list over the 
; past almost 12 years.  And I have shown my appreciation of the 
; beauty of nature in my careful observations of the FC sky and my 
; continuing reports of the FC weather.  And at least most of the 
; time, but not always, I also appreciate cats!
; 
; Now on to the fractal business before I get scolded by the all-
; seeing god of the Fractint list.
; 
; Today's image has a kind of beauty about it.  The beauty might 
; be a bit hard to recognize, but it is there, waiting for some 
; intrepid fractalist to discover and enjoy it.  The image is a 
; scene on the main spike of its oversized parent Mandelbrot set, 
; in the area of the East Valley of the large minibrot.
; 
; A quick glance gives the impression of discontinuities, though 
; none actually exist in the image, where everything blends 
; smoothly together without breaks.
; 
; The optimistic rating and the name "A New Beginning" reflect the 
; national mood of the day.  I'll not speculate on what the mood 
; might be in a year or two.  But regardless of moods, the calcula-
; tion time of only 45 seconds will give no problems.
; 
; If other problems should arise however, the finished image may 
; be seen on the FOTD web site at:

;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Tuesday began with clear skies and a temperature of 5F -15C here 
; at Fractal Central.  But at noon the clouds moved in and the 
; fractal cats turned cranky.  The afternoon high of 27F -3C left 
; them cold.  Their biggest thrill came during the middle of the 
; night, when a noisy cat fight broke out nearby.  Another thrill 
; came in the afternoon, when a mouse darted across the kitchen 
; floor, barely escaping Cassie's pounce.
; 
; My day was filled with work, and to keep FL happy I joined her 
; to watch the inaugural festivities on TV.  To my surprise, I 
; actually enjoyed the ceremonies.  The next FOTD will be posted 
; on schedule in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and wait for 
; the sunrise.
