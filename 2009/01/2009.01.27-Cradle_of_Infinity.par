; FOTD -- January 27, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes yesterday's image to the limit.  I named it 
; "Cradle of Infinity" because somewhere in the vicinity of the 
; value of the real(p3) parameter, the Julia set expands to 
; infinity before collapsing back on itself.  With the limited 
; mathematical precision available, I came as close as possible to 
; the point of infinity, close enough for today's image to give a 
; pretty good idea of what that ideal fractal must look like.
; 
; The zig-zag boundaries are a result of rendering the fractal 
; with the inside set to 'zmag'.  I have no idea how the rather 
; lurid color scheme came about.
; 
; If I had put a little more effort into the coloring, the rating 
; of a 7 might have been a bit higher.  The calculation time of 
; 3-1/2 minutes should bring little hardship.  And even this may 
; be eliminated by dashing out to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; Monday featured partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 28F -2C 
; here at Fractal Central.  But the fractal cats did not waste 
; time complaining about the weather, they spent the day celebrat-
; ing their glorious victory.
; 
; An annoying mouse has been darting around the fractal kitchen 
; the past few days.  Monday morning the intrepid mouse darted out 
; once too often.  Both cats were on kitchen patrol when the mouse 
; dashed across the room.  Nicholas, the large but clumsy black 
; british shorthair, pounced first but missed.  All was not lost 
; however, for he chased the mouse right toward small but agile 
; Cassie, who pounced and easily caught the mouse.  Not a cruel 
; cat, Cassie dispatched the mouse quickly and offered it to FL.  
; Both fractal cats were rewarded generously.  I did not see the 
; mighty victory, but FL, who was on the scene, gave complete 
; details . . . once she settled down, that is.
; 
; The rest of my day was notably average.  The next in the ongoing 
; series of gorgeous fractals will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and even a mouse deserves a break.
