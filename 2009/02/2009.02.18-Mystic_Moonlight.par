; FOTD -- February 18, 2009 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is another reworking of an old FOTD image.  The 
; old image is named "Europa".  It is an imaginary scene on the 
; icy moon of Jupiter, which appeared on June 21, 1997.  I did 
; little to the original image other than intensify the colors and 
; rotate it an infinitesimal bit.
; 
; The result is a fractal that strikingly resembles a photograph 
; of an icy but peaceful seacoast in the light of a full moon.  I 
; named the new version of the original image "Mystic_Moonlight".  
; One glance of the image will explain the name.
; 
; I wrote the formula, Man-YZ-XZ, when I was experimenting with 
; rotating images in the 4-D Julibrot figure.  Looking at the 
; formula today, I'm not sure how it was supposed to work.
; 
; I rated today's image at a 9.  I could have been more conserva-
; tive with the rating, but just because my politics tend to the 
; conservative side doesn't mean I can't be liberal with my FOTD 
; ratings on occasion.
; 
; The calculation time of 66 seconds will pass like nothing.  The 
; trip out to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to stare in awe and wonder at the finished image posted there, 
; will not only avoid all unpleasantness, but will bring instant 
; fulfillment.
; 
; Tuesday was a nondescript day here at Fractal Central, both with 
; the weather and the fractal cats.  Sunny skies and a temperature 
; of 39F 4C kept the cats in and out of their favorite window.  At 
; one point a squirrel leaped onto the opposite window sill, but 
; scampered away before the sleeping cats were aware of it.
; 
; My day was average.  The work was finished early in the after-
; noon, which left plenty of time to work on the colors of today's 
; fractal.  The next in the unending series of FOTD's will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if it leads to 
; madness when we wonder what lies behind our sensory images of 
; the 'outer' world, this probably explains how I could keep the 
; FOTD going for almost 12 years -- I must be mad!
; 
; P.S.  My current re-working of old images does not mean I will 
; stop posting new images.  I am simply tweaking a few of my older 
; images that I have long thought need improvement.
