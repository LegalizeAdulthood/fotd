; FOTD -- February 05, 2009 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The question of fractal reality sometimes arises to puzzle even 
; the most devoted fractal fans, and sooner or later every fractal 
; fan asks himself, "Are fractals real?"
; 
; To begin, fractals must have some kind of reality.  How else 
; could we have pictures and animations of them?  But it is 
; obvious that fractals are not made of material.  They appear to 
; be more like mathematical abstractions, but abstractions have no 
; shape, so how can fractals be abstractions?
; 
; Mathematics is basically human thought processes stated in 
; symbolic form, so could fractals be made of thought?  Thoughts 
; are usually considered to be less real than objective material 
; objects.  This is why we say, "ghosts are not real, they exist 
; only in the mind."  But sometimes thoughts can become almost 
; real.  In dreams, for instance, thoughts can appear quite as 
; objectively real as any material object.  So are fractals made 
; of semi-materialised thought?
; 
; If fractals are made of thought, we then wonder what thought is 
; made of?  A materialist would claim that thought is a by-product 
; of the brain.  So if fractals are made of thought, they are 
; therefore created by the neural activity of the brain.  But what 
; is neural activity?  Cognitive specialists tell us that neural 
; activity consists mainly of electric and chemical interactions 
; between neurons.  Now it looks like fractals are made of electro-
; chemical interactions.  I could continue by asking what are the 
; interactions made of, but an endless regression is now becoming 
; apparent.
; 
; At the same time, an idealist, such as myself, would tell us 
; that with thought we have reached the end of the line.  Con-
; scious thought is the ultimate reality, and it is meaningless to 
; ask what thought is made of.  My conclusion is that fractals are 
; made of thought, which can take many forms from total abstrac-
; tion to a rock-solid impression of objective material reality.  
; Fractals are quite real, in fact they are as real as thought.
; 
; Now let's end the philosophical fractal digression and say a few 
; words about today's image.
; 
; I named the image "Venusian Landscape" because something about 
; it reminds me of the first pictures sent back from the surface 
; of Venus.  I rated it at an 8 because, unlike the surface of 
; that planet, the image has a rather sunny feeling about it.
; 
; The parent fractal is a cubic Mandelbrot set surrounded by seven 
; spokes inside a circle that makes the set resemble the hub of a 
; wheel.  Today's image is located some distance to the northeast 
; of the cubic Mandeloid.
; 
; The calculation time of a zippy 1-1/4 minutes should bring 
; happiness to every fractalist.  Hard-to-please fractalists may 
; find comfort on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted for instant viewing.
; 
; Lots of sun prevailed here at Fractal Central on Wednesday, 
; though a morning low of 16F -9C made for quite a chilly start to 
; the day.  The high of 28F -2C was a little better.  The fractal 
; cats thoroughly enjoyed the sun.
; 
; With the main computer back and up and running, my day was fair 
; enough.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and is the mind a by-product of the brain or are the 
; things we call brains actually sense-produced images in the mind?
