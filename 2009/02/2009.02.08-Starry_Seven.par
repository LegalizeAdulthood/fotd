; FOTD -- February 08, 2009 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To celebrate the warmest day in several months, FL and I took a 
; trip into the surrounding country on Saturday.  Perhaps not by 
; chance, we came upon an antique emporium we had not yet visited. 
; Luckily, the place was small and we made it back to F.C. well 
; before nightfall, which left ample time for my fractal ambitions.
; 
; The image shows an order-8 minibrot on the northwest shore line 
; of a monumentally enlarged Mandelbrot set.  The location is in 
; the area where Siegel disks appear in the corresponding Julia 
; sets.  (Siegel disks are a story for another day.)
; 
; For no rational reason I named the image "Starry Seven".  Then 
; I rated it at a 7-1/2, giving myself a 1/2-point bonus for the 
; extra effort I put into the coloring.
; 
; The calculation is exactly seven minutes, within 1/100th of a 
; second.  I think this is the first time this has happened.  But 
; the time is a bit on the slow side, so for convenience, the 
; finished image has been or soon will be posted on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Some clouds moved in here at Fractal central on Saturday, but 
; when the temperature reached a high of 48F 9C, it felt almost 
; like a day in mid-May.  The fractal cats watched the scene from 
; the big window, waiting patiently for our return.
; 
; My day was average.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, 
; with no guarantee of its quality.  Until then, take care, and is 
; it unreasonable to fight for reason.
