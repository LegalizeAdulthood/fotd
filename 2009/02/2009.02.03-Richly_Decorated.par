; FOTD -- February 03, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is the most unusual parent 
; of all time.  Its main problem is that it is so small it's 
; invisible at the default opening magnitude.  But despite initial 
; appearances, a tiny mandeloid lies at the center of the opening 
; screen, and today's image proves it.
; 
; When magnified a few hundred times, this mandeloid reveals 
; itself to be splitting apart on its west side.  Its Seahorse 
; Valley has broadened into a double wedge, and deep in this wedge 
; today's scene is found.
; 
; The magnitude of 1.6*(10^12) is deceiving.  When the parent 
; fractal was shrunk, the decimal point of the coordinates shifted 
; several places to the left, giving an illusory increase in 
; precision.
; 
; The rating of a 7 seems fair enough, though if I had had more 
; time to work on the colors, I might have raised the rating to an 
; 8.  I'm not quite sure what the name "Richly Decorated" refers 
; to.  Most likely it's the areas of chaos.
; 
; The calculation time of 14 minutes is admittedly slow, but 
; nothing that a SOTA unit cannot handle with ease.  (Unless the 
; machine is over-qualified, that is!)
; 
; Those with over-qualified units may see the image by hurrying to 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and enjoying the finished image there.
; 
; Early morning clouds, steadily falling temperatures, midday rain 
; and late afternoon snow made a mess of Monday here at Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cats agreed, and didn't even try to find 
; a comfortable spot in their favorite window.
; 
; My day was so busy with other things that I had little chance 
; to be unhappy about the weather.  The next FOTD will be posted 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be ready for whatever.
