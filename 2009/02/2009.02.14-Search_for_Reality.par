; FOTD -- February 14, 2009 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "Search for Reality".  The name came about 
; when something in the image reminded be of the sub-atomic realm, 
; which is a totally different form of existence.
; 
; I have been fascinated with 'reality' ever since my father 
; introduced me to the puzzle of reality when I was around age 12. 
; Until then, I had wondered why there was such a fuss about the 
; nature of reality.  I had automatically assumed that the world 
; we see around us is real, and that was that.  Then on a Sunday 
; morning, as my father and I were looking from a second floor 
; window at a ringing bell swinging back and forth in the tower of 
; a church a block away, he turned to me and asked if the sound we 
; were hearing were the actual bell itself.  Thinking it was a 
; test of my scientific knowledge, I replied that we were not 
; hearing the bell itself, we were hearing only the sound waves 
; from the real bell.
; 
; Then he pointed to the bell swinging in the tower and asked if 
; that were the actual bell.  Without thinking, I replied that 
; yes, that is the actual bell that is making the sound.  But when 
; I said this, my father told me that I was wrong.  We were not 
; seeing the actual bell, we were seeing only the light waves 
; coming from the real bell.  When he said this, I asked him what 
; then is the real bell, and he told me that no one knows what the 
; real bell is.  The real bell, as well as the reality behind 
; everything else we see in the world, is a mystery, and this 
; mystery is what all the philosophical fuss is about.  Ever since 
; then, I have been wondering what, if anything, is really out 
; there.  And now I find myself wondering if even fractals are 
; really out there.
; 
; One thing certain (I hope) is that today's image really exists.  
; Its heavenly blue tints and gently curved neon rings have earned 
; it a rating of an 8-1/2, 1/2 point of which is a reward for the 
; coloring.  The parent fractal is the same one that has supplied 
; the past 3 days' FOTD images.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes will pass like magic once 
; the heavenly colors come into view.  Those who doubt that heaven 
; exists may see the image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; without fear of eternal condemnation.
; 
; Heavy clouds, continued breezy conditions and a temperature of 
; 41F 5C made for a typical midwinter day here in central Pennsyl-
; vania.  The fractal cats were restless due to the lack of sun, 
; and almost got into a fight over a catnip mouse.  My day was 
; rather uneventful, which, taken wrongly, might imply that there 
; actually was an 'event'.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and would the real reality please 
; stand up.
