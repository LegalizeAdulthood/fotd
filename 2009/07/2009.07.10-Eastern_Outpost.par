; FOTD -- July 11, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In keeping with the East Valley theme of July, today's scene 
; lies deep in the East Valley of a large minibrot at the eastern 
; edge of the 'fan' of the parent fractal that results when 
; various portions of Z^(-1.35) and Z^(-7.2) are combined and 
; (1/C) is added.
; 
; As promised, no elephants appear in the scene, though various 
; elephant parts are scattered about, and the alien pop-eyes are 
; also in evidence.
; 
; I named the image "Eastern Outpost" for no apparent reason.  The 
; rating of a 7 is unexceptional, but still better than the 
; parade of discombobulated pachyderms that just finished passing.
; 
; The calculation time of just under 13 minutes is admittedly 
; slow.  Most of the slowness is due to the fact that the scene 
; lies so deep in its parent valley, where the iteration count is 
; unusually high.
; 
; But why not escape the burden of running the included parameter 
; file by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a high temperature of 86F 30C, Friday was a bit too warm 
; and muggy for total comfort here at Fractal Central.  And in 
; addition, the crystal blue skies of the past few days turned a 
; hazy gray.  The fractal cats didn't mind it a bit however.  The 
; intruding tomcat appears to have gone off to prowl elsewhere.
; 
; My day was unusually busy, busy enough in fact that things 
; started to get out of control.  But the panic was nipped in the 
; bud, and in the end everything was as it should have been.  The 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and if you work at it hard enough, you too could become a 
; professional skeptic.
