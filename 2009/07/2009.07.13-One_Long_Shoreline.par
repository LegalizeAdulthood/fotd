; FOTD -- July 14, 2009 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; What does today's image have to do with East Valley?  It has 
; everything to do.  There are 12 east valleys in the image.  The 
; tip of the 12 spikes at the top of the scene are actually 12 of 
; the 10-million east valleys spaced evenly around the edge of an 
; order 10,000,001 minibrot.
; 
; On my screen the spikes at the top of the image are about 3cm 
; apart.  Since there are 10-million spikes around the perimeter 
; of this minibrot, its circumference must be 30-million centime-
; ters, which gives a diameter of about 10-million cm.  Since 
; there are 100,000 centimeters in one kilometer, the diameter of 
; the entire minibrot at the scale of the image must be about 100 
; kilometers or 63 miles.  No wonder the tiny bit of the minibrot 
; that fits on the screen appears to have a straight edge.  It's 
; the same reason that the surface of the earth appears flat.
; 
; Another curiosity is the detail inside the 12 spikes.  At first 
; glance, this detail appears to be identical in every spike, but 
; actually it changes slightly in each spike.  What an interesting 
; trip it would be to circle the entire minibrot and watch the 
; detail in the 10-million spikes gradually cycle through its 
; series of changes.
; 
; The elements at the top of the frame are made of order-10000001 
; stuff, which changes very slowly.  The elements at the bottom of 
; the frame are quadratic stuff however, and down here the changes 
; come fast.  And yes, there are countless smaller near-circular 
; minibrots in the image.  The most obvious one lies in the lower 
; right quadrant.
; 
; I named the image "One Long Shoreline" after the 300-kilometer 
; shoreline of the minibrot whose edge appears at the top of 
; today's image.  I rated the image at an 8 because that's what I 
; think it's worth.
; 
; The calculation time of 4-1/2 minutes is well within reason.  
; But if you decide to calculate the image, don't become concerned 
; when nothing shows up for a minute or so.  The top several lines 
; are blank black.
; 
; As always, the finished image is posted for immediate and total 
; gratification on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Picture perfect weather prevailed here at Fractal Central all 
; day Monday, while the fractal cats, Nicholas and Cassie, took it 
; easy.  (For the exact conditions, picture an absolutely perfect 
; day at your favorite spot on earth.)  At one point, Nicholas, 
; apparently having forgotten the talk he had with the doctor when 
; he was a kitten, got a bit frisky and started yelling like a 
; lovesick tomcat.  A quick serving of half-and-half settled him 
; down and reminded him of what the doctor had told him.
; 
; My day was un-eventful.  With only a modicum of luck, tomorrow 
; will be the same.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and wouldn't life be dull if rational-
; thinking skeptics were right when they claim the paranormal does 
; not exist?  (Of course, this in no way implies that I think the 
; skeptics are wrong.  I *know* they are wrong, even though they 
; are convinced they are right!)
