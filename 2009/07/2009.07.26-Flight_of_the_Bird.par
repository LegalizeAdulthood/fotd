; FOTD -- July 26, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is late, just as I warned might happen.  FL and I 
; decided to have a fun afternoon on Saturday, and, not wanting to 
; carry along the laptop, (I never do), I had to forget the frac-
; tal search.  But when we returnrd to FC late in the afternoon, I 
; had good luck with the search for the day's fractal.
; 
; Good luck is always necessary because one of the greatest 
; problems in the continuing FOTD is how to avoid giving the 
; impression that the images all look the same -- just another 
; minibrot with just so much more fractal variety around it.
; 
; Today's image was found in the East Valley of the parent that 
; results when 1.1 part of plain Z is combined with Z^11 and plain 
; C is added, and it actually does appear at least a little 
; different from what has gone before.  But to be honest I must 
; mention that the parent fractal is a Mandelbrot set with 10 east 
; valleys, which are on its west-southwest side.  Today's scene is 
; located in the break between valleys 5 and 6.
; 
; I named the image "Flight of the Bird", leaving it to the viewer 
; to supply the exact identity of the 'bird'.  I rated the image 
; at a 7 -- FOTD average.
; 
; The calculation time of 44 seconds is almost breathtakingly 
; fast, so if shortness of breath becomes a problem, the finished 
; image is or soon will be available for instant pleasure on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The image will bring some pleasure, but it will not answer the 
; question of why there is something instead of nothing.
; 
; A warm muggy day on Saturday with a temperature of 84F 29C was 
; given variety by a short but sharp shower at 6pm.  The fractal 
; cats do not worry about rain, so they slept through the event.
; 
; My day was relaxing.  If all goes well, the next FOTD will 
; likely be posted in about 8 hours.  If not, the wait will be 
; longer.  Until whenever, take care and worry not.
