; FOTD -- July 29, 2009 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows nothing.  Take my word for it, there is 
; nothing in the image.  If you doubt this, reset the inside to 
; 'numb' and rerun the parameter file.
; 
; True, there is nothing in the image, but like in quantum 
; physics, where a vacuum can be filled with quite a lot of 
; something, the nothing in today's image is filled with invisible 
; energies, and an active inside fill will make the energy of the 
; nothing visible.  The 'bof60' inside fill did the job in today's 
; image, where nothing fills the screen.  The nothing appears to 
; be a skeletal Mandeloid, which fades into even less than nothing 
; as it approaches its East Valley.
; 
; There is a curious thin broken line extending southeast from 
; where the East Valley of the large Mandeloid should be.  This 
; line probably holds interesting patches of nothing also, but I 
; have not yet checked it.
; 
; Since it is rather hard to give a rating to nothing, I rated the 
; image at a question mark.  The name "Nothing In Sight" describes 
; the image perfectly.
; 
; The calculation time of 4-1/2 minutes is brief enough to make 
; running the included parameter file worth the effort, especially 
; since nothing will be visible when the calculation is completed.
; 
; Another way to see nothing is to visit the FOTD web site where 
; the finished image is posted.  The web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where you might be surprised at how attractive nothing can be.
; 
; Typical midsummer weather prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Tuesday, which means heat, haze, humidity and a continuing 
; threat of showers.  The fractal cats gave up activity when the 
; temperature reached 88F 31C and spent the day under the cool air 
; vent.
; 
; My day was busy enough to keep me distracted from the hot 
; weather but not so busy as to seem hurried.  The next FOTD will 
; be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and prepare.
