; FOTD -- July 21, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Despite my questionable mood, there is a fractal for today.  Its 
; name is "Fractal Telescope" and it's pretty much the same as 
; yesterday's fractal.  If you enjoyed yesterday's image, you'll 
; enjoy today's also; if yesterday's image left you bored, you'll 
; be bored again today.  But today's image calculates in only 10 
; seconds, so regardless of how you feel, little time will be 
; wasted.
; 
; If in doubt, view the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Monday got off to a bad start here at Fractal Central when FL 
; asked why I wrote such a negative discussion for yesterday's 
; FOTD and suggested that I should learn to think in a more 
; 'positive' manner.  (She does read most of the FOTD discussions.)
; 
; I told her that I assumed we would never again explore deep 
; space because we lack the resources -- it's that simple.  And 
; being testy, as I always am during the early hours, I launched 
; into a lecture about the overblown value of 'positive thinking'. 
; 'All the positive thinking in the world will not get men to the 
; other planets.' I added.
; 
; Then, still annoyed by the original comment, a great old sci-fi 
; movie, "The Day the Earth Stood Still", came to mind.  In the 
; movie, a visitor from an advanced race of space aliens tells us 
; either to get our act together and stop fighting, or face total 
; destruction.  I speculated whether there might be a lot more 
; truth in the old movie than we first imagined.
; 
; I thought of some kooky conspiracy theories floating around.  
; One of them is about a 'Galactic Federation', of the advanced 
; races in the galaxy, which is closely monitoring mankind's 
; behavior.  When they saw us successfully reach the moon, they 
; became alarmed and feared we might soon spread our violence to 
; the other planets of the solar system and eventually the stars.
; 
; To protect themselves from our violence, they secretly ordered 
; our government to end the moon landings at once and abandon all 
; future plans for manned deep-space exploration.  This is why the 
; Apollo program was terminated prematurely.  The aliens then 
; restricted our manned space efforts to low earth orbit, where we 
; could do no harm, and kindly permitted us to develop the space 
; shuttle to give us something to keep us occupied.  We would not 
; be permitted to return men to the moon or send men to the other 
; planets until we learned how to live in peace among ourselves.
; 
; Then, almost believing my own words, I said we have failed 
; miserably, and as a result the aliens have ordered us to destroy 
; the space station, which was to have been our stepping stone to 
; the stars.
; 
; 'But hope is in sight,' I added.  The aliens will soon appear 
; openly and reveal the truth about life throughout the galaxy, 
; which we now are aware of only as the various beliefs of the 
; religions.  Hopefully, when we know the details about things now 
; considered supernatural and are given proof that these things 
; actually exist, we will have no further reason to fight about 
; our different religious beliefs.  Soon after that, we will all 
; start to love one another, everyone will be equal, no one will 
; be in need, etc. etc. etc., and we will be permitted to join the 
; Galactic Federation and, as inhabitants of the galaxy, travel to 
; the stars.
; 
; At this time, FL told me to come to my senses, and I told her 
; that she was now the one thinking negatively.  She got offended, 
; went into a sulk and sulked for most of the day.
; 
; Due to much higher humidity, the seasonal temperature of 81F 27C 
; here at Fractal Central on Monday felt more unpleasant than the 
; same temperature on Sunday, when the air was dry.  The fractal 
; cats' inner thermometers must have registered the humidity, for 
; they spent the afternoon stretched to almost their full lengths 
; of about one meter.
; 
; With FL sulking, my day was unusually quiet but not all that 
; unpleasant.  The work was out of the way by mid-afternoon, and I 
; spent the rest of the day watching reruns of the moon landing.  
; Unless a man lands on the moon before tomorrow around this same 
; time, the next FOTD will appear on schedule.  Until then, take 
; care, and do I really believe in an alien conspiracy to confine 
; mankind to the planet earth?  That's for the wise to know and 
; the others to guess.
