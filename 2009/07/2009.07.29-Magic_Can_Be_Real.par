; FOTD -- July 30, 2009 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "Magic Can Be Real".  I have forgotten the 
; reason, but one thing certain is that 100 years ago, fractals 
; themselves would have been considered magic.  Of course, stage 
; magic is real enough, but all of it is based on natural laws and 
; is not really magic in the supernatural sense.
; 
; Today's magic fractal came to pass when I combined 1/2 part of 
; Z^(5.5) with Z^(3.5) and added C.  The parent fractal is shaped 
; rather like a north-south oriented lozenge with a Mandeloid 
; hanging from its lower end.  A small oval bay lies between the 
; lozenge and the Mandeloid.  Today's image is located in the east 
; branch of the valley separating this small bay from the lozenge.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is all I could do for the image, which really 
; could have benefited from additional work on the colors.  The 
; calculation time of 6 minutes is a bit longer than the image is 
; worth.  Better value may be found however on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted for peace and contentment.
; 
; The temperature of 79F 26C was pleasant enough, but the clouds 
; and occasional light rain kept a damper on outdoor activities 
; here in the Fractal Central area on Wednesday.  The fractal cats 
; checked the weather once or twice, then Cassie found the empty 
; laundry basket and spent the rest of the afternoon curled in it. 
; When Nicholas saw he would not have the basket, he leaped to the 
; top of the secretary, where he stretched out for the afternoon.
; 
; My day was spent getting the work out of the way.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and we're 
; rational people.  We know that real magic of the supernatural 
; kind does not exist . . . or do we?
