; FOTD -- July 18, 2009 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image returns us to the elephant menagerie.  While 
; wandering aimlessly through the zoo, I stumbled upon the strange 
; elephant in todays image, which is one in a series of similar 
; elephants lined up along the shore line of East Valley of a 
; minibrot on the main filament of the fractal that results when 
; the formula Z^(1.1892)+C is calculated 4 levels up the logarith-
; mic ladder.  BTW, 1.1892 is the 4th root of 2.
; 
; The elephant in the image, as well as the unseen ones on either 
; side of it, has its trunk apparently tied in a knot, or at least 
; a spiral.  Actually, it takes quite a bit of imagination to see 
; an elephant in the image at all.  The most striking feature is 
; the sawtooth pattern that pervades the scene, and the almost too 
; intense colors.
; 
; The name "Knotted Trunk" refers to the trunk of the unfortunate 
; elephant in today's image.  The rating of a very mediocre 5 
; indicates that I don't give a croak about the trunk.
; 
; But the calculation time of 30 minutes is indeed a problem.  The 
; image is hardly worth the wait, so I recommend viewing the 
; already finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; While stuck in a traffic backup today, FL found herself next to 
; a car playing a Hip Hop 'song' at ear-splitting volume.  A white 
; woman was driving the car and FL was shocked at the violence and 
; anger expressed in the shouted words.
; 
; When FL returned to FC, she asked me how such unpleasant 'music' 
; could be so popular.  How, she asked, can people stay so angry 
; that they enjoy listening to such stuff all day.  Not wanting to 
; get into a philosophical discussion, I went to the book shelf in 
; my workroom, picked up the book "Patterns in the Void" by Sten 
; Odenwald, and told FL to read the epilogue, which describes the 
; rational but hopeless view of the world that I feel is largely 
; responsible for the festering anger and depression that makes 
; such violent music not only acceptable but actually fulfilling. 
; But the last time I noticed, she had not opened the book.
; 
; Clouds and light rain spoiled the day on Friday here at Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cats enjoyed the much cooler temperature 
; of 72F 22C.  My day was average.  The next FOTD will be posted 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and I hear that the aliens 
; are softening us up so we'll be unable to resist when they 
; arrive in force to carry us off as slaves.  But then, why would 
; an alien race so technologically advanced as to be able to 
; navigate interstellar space need something as primitive as slave 
; labor to do their menial tasks?
