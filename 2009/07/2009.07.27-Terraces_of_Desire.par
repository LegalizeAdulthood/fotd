; FOTD -- July 28, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is more a creation of program gimmicks than a 
; fractal discovery, but even so, the final result earns an honest 
; and average 7.  The parent fractal came about when I combined 
; equal parts of Z^3 and Z^5 before adding straight C.  It is a 
; double-bayed thing oriented north-south and resembling a peanut. 
; Today's image is located in a wedge-shaped bar in a double bud 
; on the southwest shore line of the southern bay of the parent.
; 
; When rendered in the normal equal-iteration manner, today's 
; image is most boring, but when the inside is set to 'fmod' and 
; the outside to 'tdis' the scene comes to life.
; 
; Most of the effect is due to the critical setting of the 'fmod' 
; proximity factor.  The terraced effect was achieved by the 
; outside setting of 'tdis'.
; 
; The name "Terraces of Desire" is a kind of joke.  It hints at 
; the junky romance novels known in the trade as bodice rippers, 
; which FL sometimes picks up when nothing better to read is 
; available.  (I must be sure she doesn't manage to read this 
; discussion.)
; 
; The rating of a 7 is good enough to make the calculation time of 
; 26 seconds worth the effort.  Even less effort will be expended 
; if the finished image is viewed on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Typical warm summer weather prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Monday, with a temperature of 86F 30C.  A few small showers were 
; in the area around noon time but none fell at FC.  The fractal 
; cats seemed content with the conditions, and spent most of the 
; day sleeping, though a bit of a row broke out when Nicholas 
; tried to chase Cassie from her sleeping spot on the living room 
; ottoman.  Nicholas ended up shaking off a scratched ear; Cassie 
; ended up with the ottoman.
; 
; My day was fair enough.  The next FOTD will likely be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and let me know when men get 
; to Mars.
