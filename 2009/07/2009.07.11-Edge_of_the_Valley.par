; FOTD -- July 12, 2009 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yesterday's image is found deep in the interior of the East 
; Valley of a large minibrot in a double-negative-Z fractal.  
; Today's image is found near the edge of the valley at about the 
; same depth as yesterday's.
; 
; Many of the same types of elements are in the image, though the 
; overall effect is much richer.  A good part of the richness 
; comes from the coloring, which I suspect is a bit too gaudy, and 
; holds the rating to a less-than-overwhelming 6.  The coloring 
; was particularly difficult with this image.  Regardless of what 
; I tried, the colors turned out either too busy or too flat.
; 
; The name "Edge of the Valley" refers to the fact that today's 
; image is located on the edge of its parent valley.
; 
; At first glance, those ubiquitous elephants are nowhere to be 
; seen in today's image, though a closer, but slow, investigation 
; will probably turn up some elephant parts and maybe an entire 
; elephant or two.
; 
; Perhaps the greatest problem with the image is its inconvenient-
; ly long calculation time of 37 minutes.  Go ahead and run the 
; included parameter file if you wish, no harm will be done.  But 
; by far the most convenient way to view the image is to surf out 
; to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the finished product there.
; 
; Saturday brought clouds, humidity, and eventually, sprinkles of 
; rain to Fractal Central.  The humidity made the temperature of 
; 82F 28C feel more like 90F 32C.  The fractal cats, being comfort-
; loving creatures, enjoyed themselves stretched out under the 
; cool air vent in the computer room.
; 
; Meanwhile, my day was average, with another average day expected 
; on Sunday.  The next FOTD, a near glorious scene in some remote 
; East Valley, will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and if it makes you feel good, believe it.
