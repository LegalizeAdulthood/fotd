; FOTD -- July 20, 2009 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Possible new formula alert!
; 
; Today's curious image must take a back seat to an event that 
; happened on this day 40 years ago, when a man first set foot on 
; the moon.  Yes, I know the exact date was July 21 in parts of 
; the world, but why quibble?  Back then, I was still in my wonder 
; years, perhaps a bit wiser than a few years earlier, but I 
; certainly had not yet realized the power of politics, nor had I 
; reached my present state of cold cynicism.  I thought I was 
; lucky enough to have been born at the right time to see mankind 
; actually begin the exploration of the solar system, just like in 
; those stories I was reading and in the shows I was watching on 
; TV.
; 
; But something went wrong.  After a few more dramatic journeys to 
; the moon, the manned exploration of outer space (low earth orbit 
; is not outer space) came to an abrupt end.  Instead of expanding 
; our exploration to the planets, we settled on developing a 
; reusable shuttle that could do little more than enter low earth 
; orbit.  To ease the disappointment, we were told of all the 
; scientific wonders that the shuttle program would bring, but so 
; far, except for the Hubble telescope when it was finally brought 
; into focus, the scientific wonders have been conspicuous only by 
; their absence.
; 
; Of course, the shuttle program gave us the international space 
; station, a white elephant if ever there was one.  It might bring 
; some minor benefits eventually, though if so, I have yet to hear 
; of them.  And I now hear that once the shuttle program ends in a 
; year or so, the space station will be considered junk, and 
; unless Russia wants to take it over, it may be sent to burn up 
; in the atmosphere over the ocean.  It now looks like the space 
; station was dreamed up only to justify the expense of the 
; shuttle program by giving it something to do.  What a waste of 
; money!
; 
; True, the dreamers are talking of men going back to the moon and 
; even to Mars in a decade or two.  Anyone who thinks this will 
; happen should pay attention to the news.  Where will the money 
; come from?  The current administration, which is very liberal 
; with spending, can't even find the money for critically-needed 
; health care reform, medicare and social-security, etc.  Given 
; the present dire economic conditions, what would voters think of 
; spending trillions of additional dollars on a space exploration 
; program?  The answer is, 'don't even think of it'.
; 
; I was not born too early to see mankind explore and colonize 
; space, the sorry truth is that it will never happen, not in our 
; lifetimes nor in the lifetimes of our descendants.  An organiza-
; tion of space explorers exploring the galaxy in space ships is a 
; fantasy.  It always was a fantasy and always will be a fantasy.
; 
; Some ideas are even more bizarre.  Some say we could reach inter-
; stellar space by leaving our bodies behind like un-necessary 
; baggage and making the trip with only our minds, which would 
; need no life-support system, nor even a ship.
; 
; It's too bad that this is also a fantasy.  Would we ever spend 
; money and effort trying to separate our minds from our bodies 
; (astral projection) when science tells us that our minds are a 
; function of our brains?  And even if it were possible, how could 
; astral explorers prove what they had discovered without people 
; on earth wondering if the discoveries were mere fantasies of the 
; explorers' minds?
; 
; The things I say are negative and not at all hopeful, but they 
; are fact.  And one thing we must never lose is the courage to 
; face the truth even when it is harsh and not what we want to 
; hear.  My one glimmer of hope is that some rational thinker will 
; point out an error in my reasoning.
; 
; Since no one is likely to do this, let's turn our attention to 
; fractals, which don't really exist but can be explored anyway.  
; I named today's image "Julia from the Side" because it's an 
; almost-Julia set of an image created by the DivideBrot series of 
; formulas, with a mixture of Z^101 and Z^2.  The DivideJulibrot 
; formula included in the parameter file might be posted for the 
; first time in this FOTD.  I'm not sure.
; 
; The image is just different and curious enough to earn a rating 
; of an 8.  And the calculation time of an incredibly short 1-1/2 
; minutes only helps the rating.
; 
; But as always, the most enjoyable way to see the finished image 
; is to view it on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The near-perfect summer weather continued here at Fractal Cen-
; tral on Sunday, laying to rest any lingering fears about man-
; made climate change, AKA global warming, at least in this area, 
; though I hear that the fears of warming are rising along with 
; the temperature in Alaska.  The high temperature of 81F 27C and 
; blue sky filled with puffy white clouds made Sunday in the FC 
; area seem like a holiday on one of the Hawaiian islands.
; 
; Never having been to Hawaii, the fractal cats had no comment.  
; My day was fair enough.  FL was happy with the antique treasure 
; she found in Benton yesterday -- a victorian lamp shade with 
; lots of fringes.  Unless we reach the stars within 24 hours, the 
; next FOTD will be posted then.  Until the next time, take care, 
; and nothing negative I might say about space exploration will 
; change the fact that I am certain that precognition does exist.
