; FOTD -- July 04, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; East Valley is sometimes called Elephant Valley.  The reason is 
; because, with just a little imagination, the fractal features 
; there can be seen to resemble elephants.  I have often mentioned 
; elephants in the FOTD discussions, but until now I have only 
; been talking about them, and not actually showing one in its 
; full glory.  Well, in today's image this oversight has been 
; corrected.
; 
; As the name "The Elephant" indicates, today's image shows an 
; East Valley elephant standing guard over its bud, as all fractal 
; elephants must do.  This particular elephant is the period-30 
; one on the southern shore line of East Valley.  The periodicity 
; is determined by the number of filaments leading into the 'star' 
; with the small red ring around it on the elephant's rump at the 
; far end of the filament leading from the bud.
; 
; The elephant's trunk is quite obvious, though material elephant 
; trunks do not terminate in an endless spiral.  One of the big 
; floppy ears elephants are famous for is quite obvious also, as 
; is its ponderous rump, which is marked by the 30-pointed star.  
; Like all fractal elephants, this one has a large minibrot on its 
; shoulder, with lesser minibrots around its mouth and belly.
; 
; The poor pachyderm appears to have a problem with its front legs 
; however.  Its front legs, like those of a tyranosaur, are so 
; small as to be virtually useless.  I doubt that those tiny legs 
; could ever reach its mouth to stuff in some tasty vegetation.
; 
; Many other elephants are scattered about the scene.  Every 
; smaller bud has an elephant standing guard over it, though the 
; individual elephants become less recognizable as the buds get 
; smaller, until they blend into a general elephant haze over the 
; tiny buds along the main shoreline.
; 
; As we go deeper into East Valley, the elephants appear pretty 
; much the same, but they move closer together as the fractal 
; elements get pinched off, until their trunks rather inelegantly 
; touch the rumps of the elephants in front of them.  As we move 
; out of the valley, the elephants' bodies gradually lose solidity 
; and turn into mere fractal filaments.  When we reach the very 
; last elephant, the period-2 one, the only thing left is its 
; trunk, which has become perfectly straight and is now the nega-
; tive stem.
; 
; Elephants are four-dimensional creatures that exist in all six 
; perpendicular planes of the Julibrot, as well as the oblique 
; slices.  But they have subtle differences in each of the planes 
; as well as the in-between slices.  In the next FOTD, I will 
; check the appearance of elephants in the Julia orientation.  
; After that, who knows.
; 
; I could give today's image no rating.  After all, East Valley 
; elephants are things the tyro fractalist finds during his first 
; hour with his first fractal program.  But there is still much to 
; be said about the endangered fractal creatures that are rumored 
; to communicate with subsonic sounds, so stay tuned to this 
; channel for the latest dope.
; 
; With a calculation time of a sizzling 3 seconds, today's image 
; is one of the all-time fastest, but it's still more fun to see 
; the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Friday turned out fair enough here at Fractal Central, the only 
; flaw being a brief shower in the afternoon.  Otherwise it was 
; partly cloudy with a temperature of 79F 26C, all of which was 
; fully appreciated by the fractal cats.
; 
; My day was unusually busy, which explains but does not excuse 
; the lateness of this FOTD.  The next FOTD, once again late, will 
; be posted in 24 hours, maybe sooner.  Until then, take care, and 
; if you still think global warming is a threat that calls for 
; prompt and panicky government legislation, notice this summer's 
; weather, something the legislators are apparently not doing.
