; FOTD -- March 09, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image with the ominous name was created with the Mystic2 
; formula, a formula that does God only knows what.  I certainly 
; don't know.  One thing I do know is that the image consists 
; entirely of 'inside' stuff brought to life by the 'bof60' active 
; inside fill, which colors the points according to how close they 
; come to the origin in their wanderings.
; 
; The Mystic2 formula draws nothing but blank circles of radius 1. 
; All the action comes from the trapped areas inside the circles.  
; As today's image shows, the things that might be done with the 
; areas inside the circles are endless.
; 
; The image reminds me of the cover of a cheap "terror" novel so I 
; named it "Abyss of Destruction", a name that might be given to 
; such a story.  I gave no rating because I consider it unworthy 
; of one.
; 
; The image is sensitive to the values of the parameters, particu-
; larly both parts of the p3 parameter.  The fast speed of the 
; image makes experimentation very easy.  Changing the function 
; totally changes the image, as does changing the inside fill.  So 
; actually, an entire range of images are waiting to be made 
; manifest by tweaking these parameters.
; 
; The calculation time is only 25 seconds on my P4-2000mhz unit, a 
; time that will bring satisfaction to those, if any, who might be 
; disappointed by the result.
; 
; Of course, calculation may be entirely avoided by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A partly cloudy springlike day with a temperature of 75F 24C 
; when I left Old Fractal Central at 1:00pm on Sunday turned into 
; a raw overcast drizzly day with a temperature of 48F 9C by the 
; time I reached New Fractal Central at 4:30pm.  The new fractal 
; cats greeted me when I arrived, caught a scent of Thomas, the 
; old fractal cat, and asked what I had been doing for the past 32 
; hours.  I answered their question with a double treat of tuna 
; and cheddar cheese.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in about 12 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and let me know when the world ends.  I don't want to 
; miss it.
