; FOTD -- March 21, 2009 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Be warned!  There will be no FOTD for March 22.  I promised FL 
; we would go on an antiquing expedition on Saturday, and there 
; is no way to get out of it.  (Besides, I kind of enjoy browsing 
; through the stuff [they call it collectibles] other people threw 
; out.)  The next FOTD will be posted on March 23.
; 
; In today's image we return to the most famous of all fractals, 
; the Mandelbrot set, where we focus our interest on a tiny mini-
; brot near the tip of the main spike.  Today's scene lies on a 
; filament extending from the large bud on the northwest shore 
; line of the main bay of the tiny minibrot.
; 
; There's not much more to be said about the image, which rates 
; only an average 5 because of its excess familiarity.  The name 
; "End of the Spike" is a misnomer, since the spike has no real 
; end.  The minibrots on it keep growing smaller as the limit of 
; 2 is approached, but never come to an end.
; 
; The calculation time of the image is 3-3/4 minutes.  Most of 
; this time is due to the magnitude, which makes arbitrary preci-
; sion math necessary.
; 
; But why fiddle with calculating when the completed image is 
; posted for instant viewing on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather was a bit chilly for the first day of spring here at 
; Fractal Central on Friday.  The temperature of 41F 5C and brisk 
; north wind made it feel more like early February.  The fractal 
; cats soon grew disgusted with the continued coming and going of 
; the sun, and instead of waiting for the last cloud to blow by, 
; decided to worry us for an extra treat of tuna.  needless to 
; say, their persistence was rewarded.
; 
; My day was moderately busy.  With the antiquing trip coming up, 
; there will be no FOTD for March 22.  The next one will be for 
; March 23.  Until then, take care, and be skeptical of the things 
; skeptics don't believe in.
