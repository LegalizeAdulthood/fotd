; 
; FOTD -- March 25, 2009  (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; A couple days ago Ted wrote that there are times when my rating 
; system makes it really hard to believe that the system exists as 
; something coherent and predictable, hopefully unaffected by the 
; weather, my mood, or the stock market fluctuations.
; 
; There is a good reason why this is so.  My rating system is 
; totally arbitrary, not at all coherent and predictable, with no 
; scientific validity at all, and very much affected by my mood at 
; the moment I decide on the rating.
; 
; The original letter continues: A coherent rating system would 
; mean a system which takes into account a set of different 
; aspects of the rated object, evaluates some of the most signifi-
; cant, and by combining these values, offers a usable way of 
; placing the rating of the object somewhere between 'Isn't it 
; wonderful!' and 'What a waste!'.
; 
; If I rated the images like this, it would be too close to doing 
; statistical science to be much fun.  I try to avoid doing things 
; in a scientific manner as much as possible.  It makes life far 
; too scientific and far too little fun.
; 
; For example, look at the trouble I have had since 2001 trying to 
; convince hard-core skeptics that a form of precognition does in 
; fact exist.  Their devotion to a rational skeptical view forms a 
; mental block that is almost impossible for them to overcome.  
; (If they even wanted to overcome it.)
; 
; By contrast, by avoiding the rational approach, I can indulge in 
; far more interesting and outlandish ideas such as the possibil-
; ity that the universe is a fractal being constantly recalculated 
; on God's cosmic computer.
; 
; There is more to the original letter, and I'll have more to say 
; about it in future FOTD's.
; 
; Today's image came about when I calculated the Mandeloid formula 
; Z^(2.01)+C at PI levels up the logarithmic ladder.  At this 
; transcendental level the parent fractal is a Mandelbrot set that 
; has split apart on the west side and rotated a few degrees 
; clockwise.  Today's image is located in an area of chaos between 
; the two split-apart parts of the main bud of the parent.
; 
; I named the image "Spring Has Sprung".  Its quality is about 
; average, thus the rating of a 6.  The name came to mind when I 
; noticed the first yellow daffodil of the season in bloom this 
; afternoon.  
; 
; The calculation time of 55 seconds makes calculating the image a 
; pleasure.  Equally joyful is the trip to view the completed 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Tuesday dawned clear and cold, with a very un-springlike tempera-
; ture of 19F -7C, but by afternoon the strong sun had warmed it 
; to 48F +9C and the light winds made the day quite pleasant.  The 
; fractal cats agreed as they competed for the best spot on the 
; shelf by the sunny window.
; 
; My day was rather busy.  Tomorrow is likely to be even busier.  
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and when will the common man see the benefits of the space 
; program.  Or perhaps the question should be, "where are the much 
; hyped benefits of the space program?"
