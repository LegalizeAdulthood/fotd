; FOTD -- March 15, 2008 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; So today's image rates only a 4.  What's wrong with a rating of 
; a 4?  I could rate it no higher because I put absolutely zero 
; effort into the coloring.  All the work was done by the Fractint 
; program, which as today's image almost shows, sometimes creates 
; unexpectedly good colors.
; 
; The parent fractal was created when I subtracted 2 parts of 
; Z^(-1.2) from 1/2 part of Z^(-5) and added (1/C).  This parent 
; is an oversized thing with a huge 'fan'.  It is totally beyond 
; verbal description, but may easily be seen by outzooming and 
; turning off the logmap.  I think today's scene is located near a 
; larger minibrot in the East Valley area of a still larger mini-
; brot near the edge of the 'fan' of the parent fractal.
; 
; Tha name "Waiting for Autumn" makes no sense at all, except for 
; those who live in the Southern Hemisphere.  Up here on the 'top' 
; side of the globe, we're waiting for spring.
; 
; I admit that the calculation time of 6-1/4 minutes is on the 
; slow side, but watching fractals calculate is almost fun.  Those 
; not amused by this kind of fun may find satisfaction on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the finished image is or soon will be posted for instant 
; gratification.
; 
; The high temperature of 54F 12C made up for the hazy skies and 
; weak sun here at Fractal Central on Saturday.  But Nicholas, the 
; oversized black British Shorthair fractal cat took little 
; notice.  He spent most of the day nursing his sore tail, which 
; somehow got caught behind a closing door this morning.  Given 
; several extra treats of tuna, both Nicholas and his tail will 
; survive.  Cassie, the small blue-cream calico, bristled to twice 
; her size when she heard Nicholas yell when his tail got caught 
; in the door.  But she soon deflated, and by evening all was 
; forgotten and forgiven, with two contented cats curled on the 
; living room rug.  Except for the cat excitement, my day was 
; average.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and it's all relative.
