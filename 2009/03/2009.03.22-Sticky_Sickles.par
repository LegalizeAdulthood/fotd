; FOTD -- March 23, 2009 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There was no FOTD for March 22 because FL and I took the day off 
; on Saturday to go antiquing.  FL found a 'great' victorian lamp 
; shade at a 'great' price and ended the day happy.  I ended the 
; day exhausted.
; 
; Today's image is kind of a bedraggled thing, a little past its 
; prime magnitude and showing its wrinkles.  But it's still worth 
; a quick look, especially since it takes only 2 minutes to finish 
; on a SOTA machine.
; 
; The parent fractal is little more than a grossly oversized 
; network of intertwined filaments, mixed with a few small open 
; areas.  Today's image is located near one of the open areas.
; 
; I had something in mind when I named the image "Sticky Sickles", 
; though I have completely forgotten what I was thinking of.  I do 
; see a series of sickle-shaped things surrounding the central 
; minibrot however, so I guess this had something to do with the 
; name.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is a bit liberal, though not as liberal as you 
; know what.  In all honesty I can not claim that the image is any 
; better than merely average.
; 
; The image is a fast one.  Equally fast is the trip to the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the already-calculated image is posted in completed form 
; for instant bliss and moderate satisfaction.
; 
; Too little sun broke through the clouds here at Fractal Central 
; on Sunday to keep the fractal cats happy while we were away.  
; The temperature of 54F 12C was close to normal, but the cats 
; would have preferred more.  When we got back around 7pm, the 
; cats were at the door, scolding us for our absence.  I'll post 
; the next FOTD in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and how is it 
; possible for people who are clearly wrong to know that they are 
; right?
