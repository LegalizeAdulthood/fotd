; FOTD -- March 18, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In yesterday's brief discussion I commented that the center of 
; yesterday's image looked interesting.  Since then, a quick 
; inspection has shown that the center of yesterday's image is 
; indeed interesting.
; 
; Today's scene is a blow-up of the eye-shaped object at the 
; center of yesterday's image.  At first glance it appears to have 
; 6-way symmetry around the center, but a closer examination will 
; reveal that the symmetry is actually 3-way, with only the 
; opposing arms being similar.  An even closer exam will show that 
; there is no symmetry at all.  The whole thing is an illusion.
; 
; So enjoy the illusion of symmetry while it lasts.
; 
; I suspect that even more interesting things lie deeper in the 
; center of today's image, and I'll check there later today.  
; Unfortunately, we are already near the limit of resolution, so 
; I'm not sure how much deeper I'll be able to go.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is based mostly on the unusual mathematical 
; aspects of the image.  The name "On the Inside" indicates the 
; location of the image with respect to yesterday's image.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes is reasonable enough to 
; please a rationalist who enjoys fractals.  The trip to the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; will please the more credulous.
; 
; Winter staged a sudden return here at Fractal Central on 
; Thursday.  The fractal cats staged a fine show of sulking when 
; the sun failed to shine on their window shelf in the afternoon.  
; Cassie asked me to turn on the sun; Nicholas just sulked.  An 
; extra large treat of tuna restored their normal cat moods.
; 
; For me the day was busier than I would like to have seen, but 
; not so busy that things got hectic.  The next FOTD is due in 24 
; hours.  I expect that it will actually be posted at that time.  
; Until then, take care, and if we found extraterrestrial life, 
; would it prove the believer's view that the universe was inten-
; tionally created to generate life, would it prove the skeptic's 
; view that extremely unlikely things sometimes do happen, would 
; it prove none of the above, would it prove both of the above, or 
; would it prove nothing at all?
