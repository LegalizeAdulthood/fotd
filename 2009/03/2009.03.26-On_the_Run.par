; FOTD -- March 26, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I ended yesterday's FOTD discussion with a casual question about 
; what benefits the space program has ever produced.  And one of 
; the replies was GPS -- the global positioning satellite system.  
; This is indeed a benefit.  In the bad old days, we actually had 
; to do things like note the positions of the stars and the time 
; of day, and then do some mathematics if we wanted to know where 
; on earth we were.  (I wonder if they still teach celestial navi-
; gation at the Naval Academy.)
; 
; Luckily, there is no navigation problem with today's image, 
; which was produced by subtracting Z^(2.6) from Z^(2.4).  To see 
; the action, simply load up the included parameter file, strike 
; the 'go' button and within a few minutes the parameter file will 
; generate the image.
; 
; I named the image "On the Run".  There is about as much reason 
; behind the name as there is behind some of my ratings.  And BTW, 
; I have been considering dropping the rating system.  All it does 
; is deter some people from checking the images.  If I do drop the 
; ratings, viewers who want to know the quality of the day's image 
; will have to calculate the image themselves or go view it on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and make their own rating.
; 
; BTW, today's image rates an adequate 7.  I really don't think it 
; is worth much more.  (Opposing opinions cheerfully accepted.)
; 
; Increasing clouds marred Wednesday here at Fractal Central, 
; though the temperature of 55F 13C was not at all bad.  The 
; fractal cats complained when their afternoon sun failed to 
; appear, but otherwise were happy enough.
; 
; My day was rather busy.  Tomorrow should be the same.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and I 
; just saw a Higgs particle pass through the room.
