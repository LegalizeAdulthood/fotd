; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It yesterday's image we set the real(z) axis perpendicular to 
; the Mandelbrot plane at the -0.75 limit of Seahorse Valley.  In 
; today's image we do the same with the imag(z) axis, which gives 
; us the Rectangular aspect of the valley.  The question then 
; immediately arises, which Z axis is actually perpendicular to 
; the Mandelbrot plane.  The answer is that they both are.  And 
; every other line in the Julia plane is perpendicular to the 
; Mandelbrot plane as well.  The two planes are absolutely perpen-
; dicular to each other, with every line in both planes perpendic-
; ular to every line in the other.  Absolute perpendicularity is 
; one of those strange unvisualizable things that cannot exist in 
; spaces with dimensions less than 4.
; 
; Seahorse Valley is filled with holes that resemble crossed 
; peanuts, which I call peanut holes.  Today's image shows one of 
; these holes in its full glory, with many other holes scattered 
; about.  These holes are not true areas of trapped points, but 
; bottomless pits of ever increasing iteration count.  In today's 
; image the maxiter is 110,000, but even this value leaves the 
; peanut hole wide open.  A much greater maxiter of 1,000,000,000 
; or so would totally close it however, greatly increasing the 
; already very slow calculation time in the process.
; 
; The unlikely values in the parameter file show that the image 
; has been greatly stretched and skewed to bring the large peanut 
; hole to a reasonably undistorted state.  Such distortion that 
; needs to be undone is very common in the Rectangular and other 
; odd planes.
; 
; I gave today's image no rating.  After all, how could a mere 
; peanut hole earn a rating?  In addition, the calculation time of 
; 1-1/3 hours will try the patience of even the most patient 
; fractalist.  I strongly recommend viewing the finished image on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy clouds blanketed the Fractal Central area on Thursday, but 
; no rain fell during the daylight hours and the temperature 
; hovered around a very comfortable 73F 23C.  The fractal cats had 
; nothing to say about things.
; 
; My day was occupied with work.  But the efficiency eventually 
; paid off and the work was finished by 4pm.  The next FOTD will 
; be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and no comment at 
; this time.
