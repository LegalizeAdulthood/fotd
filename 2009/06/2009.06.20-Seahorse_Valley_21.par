; FOTD -- June 21, 2009 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Would the real "Seahorse Valley" please stand up.  Today's 
; scene, with its unresolved minibrot and well-resolved peanut 
; holes, lies in Seahorse Valley.  But this valley is not the 
; obvious one.  It is the Seahorse Valley of the large minibrot at 
; -1.75 on the main stem of the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; It makes little difference however.  The smaller version has all 
; the features of the large 'true' valley, and even a few extra 
; things such as filaments thrown in.  In fact, today's image is 
; located on one of these filaments leading from a bud on the west 
; side of the parent valley.
; 
; At a depth of +0.00003i, the scene is quite far down into the 
; valley.  Only the super-high-speed type=mandel algorithm enables 
; the image to calculate in an astonishing 35 seconds.  I would 
; have switched to arbitrary precision math for a slightly better 
; rendering, but a test showed that this would have increased the 
; calculation time to a very slow 8-1/2 hours, hardly worth the 
; slight improvement.
; 
; There must be something of worth in the image, or else I would 
; never have rated it at a 7-1/2.  The greenish-blue background is 
; of my creation; the program did the rest.
; 
; If the calculation time of 37 seconds is too fast for comfort, 
; why not zip out to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the finished image there.
; 
; Saturday began with heavy rain here at Fractal Central.  By noon 
; the steady rain changed to heavy showers, which continued on and 
; off into the evening.  The temperature hovered around a reason-
; able 70F 21C all day.  The fractal cats slept through most of 
; the wetness, becoming active only at mealtime.
; 
; My day was average -- enough said.  Unless something totally un-
; expected happens, the next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and with an added space 'nowhere' becomes 
; 'now here'.  (I saw it on a church bulletin board.)
