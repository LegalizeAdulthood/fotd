; FOTD -- June 16, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Start with the number 5, extract the square root, add 1 to this 
; root and divide the sum by 2.  The result is the golden ratio, 
; 1.618, where (a) is to (b) as (b) is to (a+b).  Also, the 
; reciprocal of 1.618 equals 1.618 minus 1, and all of this is 
; curiously important in making fractals.
; 
; Since this is Seahorse Valley month, I decided to see what goes 
; on in the Seahorse Valley of the Z^1.618+C Mandeloid.  The first 
; thing I discovered is that this Mandeloid has no Seahorse 
; Valley, but my disappointment did not last long, for the 
; (-Z)^1.618+C Mandeloid, which is far more interesting, has a 
; very well developed Seahorse Valley.
; 
; In today's image we explore quite deep into this valley, where 
; the going is very slow, but the rewards for the patient 
; fractalist, very great.  Due to a lack of time, today's image 
; just scratches the surface of this part of the valley.  In that 
; scratch however I found a minibrot resembling a large ant 
; swimming in elements resembling scalloped potato slices.
; 
; Most of the detail in the potato slices was achieved by 
; rendering the image with the outside set to 'tdis'.  The rating 
; of a 7 does not quite justify the calculation time of over an 
; hour.  I recommend saving an hour of so of precious time by 
; going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image posted there.
; 
; Monday proved to be a repeat perfect day here at Fractal 
; Central, with the thunder clouds again remaining far to the 
; northeast.  The crystal blue skies, puffy clouds overhead and 
; temperature of 81F 27C made the fractal cats very happy.
; 
; My day was average, which is the average situation.  Tuesday 
; will likely be average again, which is also average.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, and this also is average.  
; Until then, take care, and Theists say God created man, while 
; Atheists say man created God.  I say maybe they both are right.
