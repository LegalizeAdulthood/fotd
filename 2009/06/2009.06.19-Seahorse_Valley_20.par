; FOTD -- June 20, 2009 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Blazing peanut holes, minibrots, and a trip to Seahorse Valley 
; -- they're all present in today's image.  The scene lies in the 
; shell of a much larger peanut hole moderately deep in the true 
; Seahorse Valley, which is the one in the classic Mandelbrot set.
; 
; There is little to be said about the Mandelbrot set that has not 
; often been said, so I will say little.  But I do think that the 
; image rates an honest 8, mostly because scenes in peanut holes 
; are not that common.
; 
; The calculation time of 3 minutes and 50 seconds is true on the 
; P4-2000mhz machine.  On the old P-200mhz the image takes 1 hour 
; and 5 minutes to finish.  And curiously enough, if the 'outside' 
; is set to 'tdis', which makes an equally interesting image, the 
; calculation takes over 9 hours even on the P4-2000.
; 
; But why not forget all these timing hassles and hurry on out to 
; the FOTD web site, where the finished image can be seen with no 
; calculation required at all.

; 
; Friday began here at Fractal Central with the threat of rain, 
; but by noon the dark clouds had cleared away, leaving a blue sky 
; speckled with clouds of the altocumulus variety and temperatures 
; around 75F 24C.  The fractal cats, unconcerned with clouds or 
; temperature, kept their eyes on two beat-up stray cats prowling 
; the area.  When the intruders went away, the resident fractal 
; cats congratulated themselves for a job well done.
; 
; The next FOTD has a 67-percent chance of appearing in 24 hours.  
; The other 33 percent is the chance that FL will be bitten by the 
; antiquing bug again.  Until next time, take care, and science 
; has most all of the answers to some questions and some of the 
; answers to most all the questions, but it never will have all 
; the answers to all the questions.
