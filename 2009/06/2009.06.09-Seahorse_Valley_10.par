; FOTD -- June 10, 2009 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The theme of the month of June is Seahorse Valley of the Mandel-
; brot set.  But there are many seahorse valleys other than the 
; one in the M-set.  In today's image we go quite deep into the 
; valley that sets off the large bud on the negative X-axis of the 
; Z^4+C Mandeloid.  Not surprisingly, we find much of the same 
; type of features that fill the depths of the classic M-set, 
; though down here they come in powers of 4 rather than 2.
; 
; There is not much more to be said about the image, except that I 
; could rate it no higher than a 6.  The calculation time of 15 
; minutes is a bit too slow to for such a mediocre image.  Con-
; sidering all this, I recommend viewing the finished image on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Tuesday dawned with a spectacular thunder-storm here at Fractal 
; Central, but the rest of the day showed a big improvement, with 
; partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 86F 30C.  The fractal 
; cats spent most of the day ignoring the weather while stretched 
; on the floor.
; 
; I am trying to talk FL into adding an occasional comment to the 
; FOTD discussion to contrast with my rather cynical views, but so 
; far she prefers to remain silently in the background.  We'll 
; keep working at it however.  In the meantime, fractal cat Cassie 
; says, "purrrrr", and cat Nicholas says, "meow".
; 
; My day was busy enough to verge on being rushed, but at the end 
; of the day, after ample complaints, everything had worked out to 
; everyone's satisfaction.  The next FOTD will be posted in about 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and then do it again.
