; FOTD -- June 25, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene on the east side of the north branch of 
; the twelfth valley out the negative stem of the Mandelbrot set, 
; eleven valleys beyond Seahorse Valley.  This valley has no name, 
; and I intend to give it none.
; 
; I arrived at the remote scene while I was searching for a limit. 
; The more remote the valleys become, the more they start to look 
; the same.  Today's image shows what I assume to be the limit of 
; the scenery in the higher-order valleys.  Similar scenes first 
; appear around the 4th valley out, and the scenes change little 
; in the valleys beyond there.
; 
; The ridiculous maxiter of 20-million is no mistake.  All these 
; iterations are actually necessary to fully resolve the scene.  
; By comparison, a similar scene in the 4th valley would require a 
; maxiter of only 100-thousand, and would calculate in a minute or 
; two.
; 
; The three brilliant yellow areas are filled-in peanut holes.  It 
; can be seen that the center filled-in hole in the peanut hole is 
; actually the 'star' at the end of the filament extending from 
; the bud.  The two 'bulbs' on either side of the center are end-
; less spirals on either side of the star.
; 
; I also see some kind of animals in the scene, though I'll not 
; try to identify them.  They're clearly not elephants, but 
; they're not seahorses either.  Maybe they're spider monkeys.
; 
; I could hardly give a rating to an image with so little to offer 
; and so much time required for the calculation.  But I will say 
; that 50 minutes may be saved by viewing the finished image on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a high temperature of 88F 31C and a hot sun, things were a 
; bit too warm for absolute comfort here at Fractal Central on 
; Wednesday.  The fractal cats were skittish because of the noise 
; of work being done on a neighboring house, but this did not keep 
; them from checking often to see exactly what was happening.
; 
; My day was busier than average but still well under control.  
; I'll be taking a short trip back to Old Fractal Central on 
; Thursday to do a little porch maintenance, so the FOTD for June 
; 26 might be late.  Until whenever, take care, and never doubt 
; the word of science.
