; FOTD -- June 23, 2009 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's scene in Seahorse Valley actually has a seahorse in it.  
; The little sea creature lies near the right edge of the frame, 
; with its tail merging with an elephant's trunk.  I have no idea 
; what a ponderous elephant is doing in a valley reserved for sea-
; horses (and pipefish) but I only report what I see.  There the 
; elephant is, and I must show it.
; 
; The scene lies in the Oblate direction at c=(-0.78), just to the 
; west of the center of Seahorse Valley.  The vertical direction 
; has been stretched to about 3 times its normal height to make 
; the seahorse recognizable.  A nominal amount of skewing was 
; needed to straighten things out.
; 
; The rating of 7.5 rewards myself for a modicum of color work.  
; The calculation time of under 11 minutes borders on slowness, 
; but the calculation may be eliminated entirely by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather on Monday here at Fractal Central 60 miles north of 
; Harrisburg was surely the reference standard to which all future 
; claims of perfect weather must be compared.  Start with a high 
; temperature of 77F 25C, the middle of the human comfort range, 
; continue with a humidity of 50 percent, again in the middle of 
; the comfort range, go on with kodachrome (now digitally intensi-
; fied) blue skies and puffy cumulus clouds so clear and sharp it 
; seemed you could reach out and touch them.  Mix in a refreshing 
; north breeze and just the right amount of ground moisture to let 
; crops and gardens grow their best.  Too bad it was just a bit 
; too cool for a comfortable dip in the pool.  The fractal cats 
; slept through it all.
; 
; My day was average.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  In 
; it I will take a one-day break from the Seahorse Valley theme to 
; demonstrate an incremental venture from our normal space into 
; the fourth dimension.  Until then, take care as always, and when 
; the weather is perfect, don't cheer up.  Remember that it can 
; only get worse.
