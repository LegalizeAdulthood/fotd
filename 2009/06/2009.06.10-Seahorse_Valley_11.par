; FOTD -- June 11, 2009 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the Oblate aspect of Seahorse 
; Valley.  The Oblate aspect is defined by the real(z) and imag(c) 
; axes of the Julibrot.  To find the Oblate view, take the point 
; at -0.75 on the negative X-axis of the Mandelbrot set and 
; imagine the real(z) axis cutting perpendicularly through this 
; point, extending in front of and behind the screen.  This line 
; is actually the X-axis of the basic Julia set of Seahorse 
; Valley, and when taken with the real and imaginary C axes 
; defines a three-dimensional hyperslice of the four-dimensional 
; Julibrot figure.  Now rotate the 2-D image on the screen 90 
; degrees around the vertical axis, through this imaginary 3-D 
; hyperslice until it sits in an upright position perpendicular to 
; the screen, facing left and right.  This is the oblate aspect of 
; Seahorse Valley.  It's easier to think about than describe in 
; words.
; 
; Now that we have our bearings in Seahorse Valley, what we find 
; in there is a whole slew of those things I call peanut holes.  
; In today's image the holes are filled in because of the maxiter 
; of one-million, but they may be seen in their full glory by 
; lowering the maxiter to 7,500.  Curiously, these peanut holes 
; appear in all aspects of Seahorse Valley, while the Mandeloid 
; elements such as minibrots vanish soon after we leave the 
; Mandelbrot orientation.
; 
; I added superfluous detail to the scene by rendering it with the 
; outside set to 'summ', and then I colored it to resemble a scene 
; on some surreal alien planet.  I rated it at an 8 because I kind 
; of like scenes on alien planets.  The calculation time of under 
; 10 minutes will probably be cut to less than half on a current 
; S.O.T.A. (state-of-the-art) machine, once the machine is taught 
; how handle the Fractint program.  Or perhaps it is best to 
; forget teaching a new computer old tricks, and trek electronical-
; ly out to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to view the finished image in its full glory there.
; 
; Thickening clouds here at Fractal Central on Wednesday did not 
; dim the spirits of the fractal cats, who spent a good part of 
; the day chasing each other up and down the hallway.  The tempera-
; ture of 84F 29C was just about normal for the end of spring.  My 
; day was busy but under control.  The next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and does dark energy come from 
; the world of fractals?
