; FOTD -- June 14, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Whenever the FOTD for Sunday is late, as it is today, it usually 
; means a surprise antiquing trip erupted on Saturday, the day I 
; find the Sunday image and write the discussion.  This Saturday's 
; trip took us to Carlisle, a town about 20 miles, 32km, west of 
; Harrisburg.  Luckily, FL found nothing absolutely necessary to 
; our survival.
; 
; The venitian blinds in today's image really are part of the 4-D 
; Seahorse Valley complex.  To save time, I'll not try to describe 
; the direction in which the north branch of the valley complex 
; was cut to give the effect.  Since the area is four-dimensional, 
; the words would have little meaning.  But I will say that the 
; open black strips are buds seen from the side, and I'll add that 
; in 4-D space certain angles can have two independent values.
; 
; I have posted similar images several times in the past, so I 
; could not give today's image a rating.  Another problem is that 
; the image takes almost 1/2 hour to calculate on the 2000mhz 
; machine, but this problem may be solved by viewing the finished 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it will soon be, if it is not already, posted.
; 
; A few showers were around the area on Saturday, but it stayed 
; dry back here at Fractal Central, giving the 4-D fractal cats a 
; hopefully pleasant day while their humans were away.
; 
; I survived -- enough said.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and measure your angles.
