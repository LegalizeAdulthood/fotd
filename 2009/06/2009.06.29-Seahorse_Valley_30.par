; FOTD -- June 30, 2009 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a puzzle.  Everyone knows that Mandelbrot-type 
; minibrots are impossible in Julia sets, so how do we explain the 
; obvious midget M-set in today's image, the parent of which is a 
; Julia set.  To see this Julia set, reduce the magnitude to 0.5 
; and recalculate the image.  The Seahorse-Valley Julia set that 
; soon fills the screen is obvious.
; 
; Well, two things need to be explained.  To begin, the minibrot 
; is somewhat warped.  Its two period-3 buds as well as its main 
; stem are missing.  And in addition, the parent Julia set is not 
; quite a Julia set.  It is double-rotated 1/1000 of one degree 
; from the true Julia orientation.  This rotation is extremely 
; small -- the width of one centimeter as seen from a distance of 
; over 1/2 kilometer -- but it is enough to reveal the Mandelbrot 
; shape of the minibrot.  To see the minibrot magically turn into 
; the Julia set of the center of the main Mandelbrot bay, change 
; real(p1) and real(p2) to 90.  Yes, 1/1000 of one degree can make 
; this much of a difference.
; 
; Other things of interest are the four partially-filled peanut 
; holes and the breakdown of the 2,4,8... series of elements 
; surrounding the minibrot.  This breakdown is no surprise, since 
; it often appears in warped minibrots such as the minibrot in 
; today's image.  The unusual texture of the image was achieved by 
; rendering it with the outside set to 'summ'.
; 
; I rated the image at an 8.  I think it has enough interest to 
; earn such a rating.  The calculation time of just over 9 minutes 
; is rather slow, but nothing to get excited about, especially 
; since the image may be viewed on the FOTD web site without the 
; need to calculate it.  The web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Picture perfect weather prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Monday -- at least the fractal cats thought so.  They thoroughly 
; enjoyed the blue skies, puffy white clouds, low humidity and 
; temperature of 84F 29C.
; 
; >From indoors I half enjoyed the outside conditions.  Meanwhile, 
; FL, having asked a question on Sunday that I had no immediate 
; answer for, enjoyed an afternoon in her garden, keeping a sharp 
; lookout for japanese beetles in the roses.
; 
; The next FOTD, the first of a new month, will be posted in 24 
; hours.  I wonder what the new theme, if any, will be.  Until 
; then, take care, and the pleasantly cool summer we're having 
; this year should quiet those greenie fanatics clamoring about 
; the imaginary perils of equally imaginary man-made global 
; warming . . . at least until it gets hot again.
