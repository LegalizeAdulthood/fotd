; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Anyone looking at yesterday's image can see at once that nothing 
; interesting lies at the tips of those narrow brilliant diagonal 
; lines inside the central bay of the Seahorse Valley Julia set.  
; But not being 'anyone', I took a look anyway.
; 
; The going was incredibly slow, but I finally found a scene that 
; rates an honest 9.  What I found is a screen filled with spider 
; webs, peanut holes and glowing comets.  This is exactly what I 
; found in a recent trip to the deepest depths of the true 
; Seahorse Valley.
; 
; Today's image is not sliced in the Mandelbrot direction however. 
; It is sliced in a virtual Julia direction, yet it is filled with 
; the stuff normally found in the Mandelbrot direction.
; 
; I did not check for Mandelbrot minibrots in the scene.  The 
; going is simply too slow.  But the image has a minibrot feeling 
; to it, and I would not be surprised to find some minibrots 
; hiding in the depths, perhaps only slightly perturbed.
; 
; And I wonder if this is a way of getting extra magnification for 
; nothing.  First we enlarge the valley as I did in yesterday's 
; image, then we can dive into the already enlarged valley and get 
; something for nothing.  Of course, it is impossible to get some-
; thing for nothing, and I suspect that all we're doing here is 
; shifting the decimal point, meaning that breakdown would happen 
; at a much less magnitude.
; 
; The name of the image is simply a catalog number.  The rating of 
; a 9 indicates that I am quite pleased with what I found in such 
; an un-promising location.
; 
; The calculation time of over 3 hours is no mistake.  I very 
; strongly recommend hurrying to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to enjoy the pleasure of seeing the image already calculated.
; 
; FL asked no interesting questions Thursday, so I have no reason 
; to wax philosophical.  (BTW, where is Mister Phil O. Sophical?)  
; The fractal cats had ample reason to complain however.  The lack 
; of sun and temperature of only 68F 20C was not to their liking, 
; and they showed their dissatisfaction by tearing apart one of 
; their catnip mice.
; 
; My day was slightly busy, but otherwise uneventful.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until next time, take care, 
; and if we found why there is something instead of nothing, we 
; would solve most other un-answerable questions.
