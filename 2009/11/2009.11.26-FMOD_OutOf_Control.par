; FOTD -- November 27, 2009 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The worst failed to happen here at FC on Thursday.  Due to a 
; last-minute change of plans, the expected guests thankfully 
; failed to arrive, leaving FL and myself to enjoy the oversized 
; dinner alone, which is actually the way I usually prefer it.
; 
; The lack of visitors also allowed time to search for a fractal.  
; I soon found one of marginal quality, which now appears as 
; today's FOTD.
; 
; The name "FMOD Out of Control" refers to the wildly exaggerated 
; image, which was created by combining negative fractional parts 
; of Z^3 and Z^5, then adding C, and finally rendering the scene 
; with the 'outside=fmod' option in effect.
; 
; The parent fractal is a ragged Mandeloid standing on its nose, 
; with a narrow open area on its south-poimting main stem.  
; Today's scene is located in a minor valley in one of the bays of 
; this small open area.
; 
; Like yesterday's image, today's is handicapped by too much 
; gaudiness, which cuts the rating by a full point.  With more 
; time, I might have been able to work the image up to a rating 
; of 7.  As it is, the rating of a 6 will have to stand.
; 
; The calculation time of just over 4 minutes should cause little 
; pain.  Any residual discomfort may be relieved by taking an 
; aspirin or by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy clouds continued here at Fractal Central on Thursday, 
; though most of the day was dry.  The fractal cats gave up 
; waiting for the sun early, and passed the afternoon curled up, 
; sleeping.  Including the semi-banquet, my day was reasonable.  
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and walk cautiously.
