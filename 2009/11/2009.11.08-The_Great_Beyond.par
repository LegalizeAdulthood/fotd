; FOTD -- November 09, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I recently watched one of those shows claiming that the world 
; will end in December of 2012.  I was already taking the doomsday 
; stuff very lightly, when an ad appeared for an automobile that 
; they claimed could run for 15 or 20 years before finally wearing 
; out.  When I heard this, I started laughing, wondering if the 
; auto designers realized they were wasting their efforts creating 
; an auto that would run for up to 20 years when the world has 
; only 3 years to go.  But then, maybe the auto will be able to 
; travel the road to heaven.
; 
; Far more important is the problem of fractals in heaven.  
; Without fractals, heaven would be more like the place down 
; below, at least to me.  But then, maybe they have computers of 
; infinite speed in heaven.
; 
; Today's image is a repeat of a very early FOTD image, which 
; appeared in April of 1997 under the name "Gothic".  This time 
; around, I recolored the original image, backed off a bit and 
; slightly stretched the entire scene.
; 
; The image is a scene in the 4-dimensional Hypermandelbrot set, 
; which is just about all I can say about it.
; 
; I named the image "The Great Beyond".  The background bud in the 
; shape of a gothic arch, or ogive, is totally beyond reach.  For 
; over 10 years I have tried futilely to find a way to bring this 
; background arch to the foreground.  I guess the arch will remain 
; forever in the great beyond of the fractal world.
; 
; Since the image is a virtual repeat, I could not give it a 
; rating.
; 
; The calculation time of 6-1/5 minutes will drag on most 
; machines.  To avoid impatience I recommend viewing the finished 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Sunday was perhaps the best November day of all time here at 
; Fractal Central, with cloudless skies, light winds and a temper-
; ature of 66F 19C.  The fractal cats actually had more sun than 
; they desired before becoming overheated and stretching out in a 
; shady corner by a north window.
; 
; My day was well with reason, even though my opinions often are 
; not.  The next FOTD can reasonably be expected to be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and prepare for who knows what.
