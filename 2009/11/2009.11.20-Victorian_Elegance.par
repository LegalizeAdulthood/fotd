; FOTD -- November 21, 2009 (Rating 7-1/2)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I think today's image is the first one that was not named by me. 
; When FL saw the image, she remarked, "How elegant.  It almost 
; looks Victorian."  I immediately named the image "Victorian 
; Elegance".
; 
; The parent fractal is an oversized thing consisting of a near 
; circular main bay with several buds of questionable periodicity. 
; The filaments that extend from the buds terminate in rings.  
; This parent was created when I combined various portions of 
; Z^(-1.05) and Z^(-5.5), then added (1/C).  Today's scene is 
; located on the eastern shore line of the main bay.  
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 might have been an 8 if I had worked on 
; the colors longer.  But a 7-1/2 is well above what we have been 
; seeing in the FOTD's lately, so I decided to let it go at that.
; 
; The calculation time of just over 7 minutes will demand a bit 
; of patience, but the result will be worth the effort.  And if 
; patience is in short supply, the finished image is posted for 
; immediate gratification on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A mixture of clouds and sun, and a temperature of 55F 13C made 
; Friday a near-average day for mid-November here at Fractal 
; Central.  The cats of the fractal variety had an average day 
; also, which means they slept through 75 percent of it and asked 
; for food the rest of the time.
; 
; In my department, the day was a bit busier than average, but 
; things worked out well and the day ended with the work caught 
; up.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and when in fractal land, do as the fractals do.
