; FOTD -- November 26, 2009 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Due to a rush in the graphics department, there was no FOTD for 
; November 25 2009, nor will there ever be one.
; 
; For several months I have been posting the FOTD's to both the 
; Fractint list and the philofractal list, but I have not seen a 
; FOTD philofractal posting appear for a week or so.  The list 
; might be down for the count, or maybe it is having temporary 
; problems.  In any event, if the P.F. list dies, the loss will be 
; only a mild one.
; 
; I sometimes wonder whether hasty, sub-standard fractals such as 
; today's are worth the effort.  Perhaps I should not post FOTD's 
; until I have images worthy of being shown to the world.  But for 
; now we'll see how it goes.
; 
; As for today's image, it is a scene in the parent fractal that 
; results when various negative portions of Z^(0.92) and Z^(-1.08) 
; are combined, and (1/C) is added.  This parent fractal is a 
; shrunken Mandeloid with part of its main bay cut off.  Today's 
; scene lies near the tip of a filament extending from a bud on 
; the southwest shore line of the main bud of the parent.
; 
; The name "Fractal Run Riot" refers to the wild palette of 
; colors, which is so gaudy that it actually holds the rating of 
; a 6 down a point or so.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes will cause little if any 
; discomfort.  Absolute comfort may be found however on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted, ready to bring complete 
; happiness.
; 
; Heavy clouds and a continuing drizzly rain made Tuesday and 
; Wednesday anything but pleasant here at Fractal Central.  With 
; all the dampness, the temperature of 50F 10C felt more like 34F 
; 1C.  The fractal cats must have agreed, for they spent both days 
; in the warmest places they could find.
; 
; For me both days were busy, but tomorrow will be slower.  The 
; next FOTD is due to be posted in 24 hours, but FL is planning a 
; mini-feast on Thursday, so I'll give a 75-percent chance that 
; the FOTD will actually be posted on schedule.  Until then, or 
; whenever, take care, and is the earth the only planet in the 
; universe with intelligent life, or is the existence of intelli-
; gent life an impossible fantasy?
