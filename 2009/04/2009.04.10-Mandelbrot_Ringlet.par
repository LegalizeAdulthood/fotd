; FOTD -- April 10, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After all these years, an occasional trip back to that king of 
; all fractals, the Mandelbrot set, always seems to yield a sur-
; prise or two.  Today's scene lies far out on a filament in the 
; interior of the north branch of Seahorse Valley of the large 
; minibrot on the main spike of the Mandelbrot set, and after all 
; this description, it's no wonder there's a little surprise in it.
; 
; What I find surprising in today's image is the thin ring of 
; debris surrounding the central minibrot.  Normally, the 
; Mandelbrot debris fields are much broader.
; 
; There is not much more to be said about the image, but one thing 
; virtually certain is that if this universe is limited and if it 
; is the only one that exists, then this particular minibrot has 
; never before appeared on the screen of a computer.  By contrast, 
; if this universe is infinite or if an infinity of similar para-
; llel limited universes exist, then this minibrot has appeared on 
; an infinity of computer screens.
; 
; Bombastic speculation aside, after not-too-careful considera-
; tion, I rated the image at a 7.  Then I noticed the narrow ring 
; of chaos surrounding the minibrot, and named it "Mandelbrot 
; Ringlet".
; 
; Despite being well beyond the range of conventional math, the 
; image calculates in a not-too-slow time of 3-3/4 minutes. An 
; even faster way to enjoy the image is to hop like the Easter 
; Bunny out to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and gaze in awe and wonder at the already calculated image there.
; 
; Thursday here at Fractal Central was much improved.  Partly 
; cloudy skies and a temperature of 61F 16C are hardly ideal, but 
; the periods of sun came at just the right time, and the fractal 
; cats had a very pleasant day.
; 
; With a customer who was unhappy when we gave him what he asked 
; for and he saw that it did not work, my day was not so pleasant. 
; But that's how it goes sometimes.  Tomorrow however should be 
; better, permitting more time for a better FOTD.  Until next 
; time, take care, and though the commandment says 'thou shalt not 
; steal' I also hear that God helps those who help themselves.
