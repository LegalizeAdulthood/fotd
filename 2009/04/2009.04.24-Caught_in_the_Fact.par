; FOTD -- April 24, 2009 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image came about when I subtracted Z^(1.1) from Z^(-1.1) 
; and added straight C.  I chose these values because exponents 
; between Z^(2) and Z^(-2) make the most interesting fractals when 
; mixed together in the iteration soup.
; 
; The effect of surrounding blackness filled with star-like dots 
; and tendrils was created by rendering the image with the logmap 
; intentionally set to too high a value.  The fancy scalloped 
; shapes surrounding the central minibrot are a natural bit of the 
; fractal however.
; 
; The parent fractal consists of a large Mandeloid facing south-
; east, with a main bud as large as its main bay, and a second 
; Mandeloid a bit to the northwest, connected to the larger 
; Mandeloid and slightly cut off by a discontinuity.  Today's 
; scene lies in a train of scattered debris leading from the 
; smaller Mandeloid toward the larger one, but being cut off by 
; the discontinuity before reaching it.
; 
; The name "Caught in the Fact" leaves open the question of what 
; fact.  God only knows, and He isn't telling.  The rating of a 
; 6-1/2 means that I like the image just enough to grant it FOTD 
; status even though my coloring was responsible for the extra 1/2 
; point of the rating.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-2/3 minutes will bring smiles to the 
; faces of the time challenged.  A trip to the awesome FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to view the completed image there will bring a smile to the 
; faces of everyone.
; 
; Partly cloudy skies brought off-and-on happiness to the fractal 
; cats of Fractal Central on Thursday, while the gusty winds and 
; temperature of 54F 12C made it feel like mid-March rather than 
; late April.  My day was fair enough.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and when I get to 
; heaven I'm going to tell God to take sensitivity training, 
; learn anger management and start obeying His own commandments.
