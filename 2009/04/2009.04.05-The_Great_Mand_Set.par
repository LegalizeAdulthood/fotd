; FOTD -- April 05, 2009 (Rating N.A.)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a slightly redone FOTD from the past.  (I leave 
; it to the viewer to find the original version.)  It's all I had 
; time for after FL and I spent most of the day Saturday exploring 
; an antique emporium near Chambersburg, PA.  (The trip was not 
; wasted.  FL found an old carpet that she insisted we simply had 
; to have.)
; 
; Today's image shows "The Great Mandelbrot Set", floating in the 
; sky above a world it has just created but to which it has not 
; yet added the details.  (Any resemblance to the assumed Deity of 
; our universe is purely intentional.)  The proportions of the 
; Great Mandelbrot Set are slightly different than those we are 
; used to, but there can be no mistaking that it is a Mandelbrot 
; set.
; 
; The nascent universe and its creator were created by subtracting 
; some Z^(0.45) from about twice as much Z^(0.98) and adding 
; straight C.  Since basically the same image is being posted for 
; the second time, I could give it no rating, but even so, I think 
; it's a bit more striking than average.
; 
; The calculation time will cause no impatience.  At a godlike 
; speed of 25 seconds, it will finish before boredom even thinks 
; of arising.  Those with over-challenged computers may view the 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Gusty winds, thick clouds and a temperature of 48F 9C took all 
; the fun out of life here at Fractal Central on Saturday.  At 
; least, that's what the fractal cats told us when we returned 
; from the antiquing expedition around 9pm.  A quick treat of tuna 
; cheered the cat duo, though I had to go into my archives to find 
; today's fast FOTD.
; 
; The next FOTD is due in a mere 8 hours.  But whether the FOTD 
; actually appears on schedule is a matter of chance.  Until next 
; time, take care, and seek union with the great fractal.
