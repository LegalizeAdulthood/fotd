; FOTD -- April 27, 2009 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The Saturday trip to Old Fractal Central, where Thomas, the one 
; remaining old fractal cat still lives, went well enough, but I 
; didn't get back to new F.C. until almost midnight, and this is 
; my excuse for having a very lazy day on Sunday.
; 
; Today's image, which I found effortlessly with the Fractint 
; evolver feature, is another of those MandNewt things that are a 
; total puzzle to me.  But whatever the image is, it rates a 6, 
; and is relatively easy on the eye.
; 
; A large part of the image consists of 'inside' stuff brought to 
; life by the 'bof60' inside fill.  Some interesting scenes might 
; lie deeper inside the image, but I was too lazy to check.
; 
; The name "Half Asleep" refers not only to the appearance of the 
; fractal but to the awareness level of the fractalist as well.  
; The calculation time of 3-1/4 minutes will bring joy to the 
; hearts of every fractal fan, as will a trip to the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted for immediate viewing 
; followed by absolute bliss.
; 
; The bright sun on Sunday here at Fractal Central looked promis-
; ing at first, but when the air temperature reached 91F 33C, the 
; sun no longer brought comfort.   The fractal cats tried lying in 
; the sun for a couple minutes, then stretched beneath the cool 
; air vent.  Needless to say, April is too early to turn on the 
; cool air, so the cats complained and cooled down on their own.
; 
; After the trip to Old Fractal Central on Saturday, I spent 
; Sunday doing little or nothing.  FL spent the day working in her 
; garden, while I checked her progress every hour or so to give 
; the impression I would be ready to help . . . if she needed it.  
; Luckily, she never did.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and I just saw a Higgs particle 
; fly past the window.  And it stopped long enough to look in.  I 
; guess this makes me world famous.
