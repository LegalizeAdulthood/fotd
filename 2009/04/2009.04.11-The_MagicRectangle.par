; FOTD -- April 11, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows one of the strange rectangles that exist in 
; a Julia set of the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid.  (To see one of the 
; actual rectangles check the Z^(2.003)+C Julia set with a C-value 
; of -1.7435+0.0i at the Z coordinates of 0.00019+0.07388i, with 
; the magnitude set to 100.  It's not a perfect rectangle, but 
; it's close enough to be quite surprising.) 
; 
; When we check today's image however, we wonder what has happened 
; to the rectangle.  The rectangle, or at least one slice of it, 
; actually is in the image.  It appears as the dark bluish area in 
; the lower right corner, with the narrow white line across its 
; center.
; 
; The rectangle has been reduced to a single narrow line because 
; today's image is not a Julia set.  It is what I call an Oblate 
; set, a slice through the four-dimensional Julibrot figure that 
; is defined by the imaginary C-axis and the real Z-axis.  It is 
; actually a fractal hybrid -- half Julia, half Mandelbrot.
; 
; Even though no full rectangle appears in the image, I named it 
; "The Magic Rectangle".  The missing rectangle is made up for by 
; the image's unusually strong impression of a three dimensional 
; scene.  I have no idea what the quite solid looking things might 
; represent however.
; 
; I rated the image at a 7, which means I consider it to be an 
; average FOTD image.  The calculation time of 1-1/4 minutes is 
; unusually fast, which will be good news for those who prefer 
; more than a single slice of their rectangles.
; 
; Another way of viewing the image is to surf out to the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view it in completed form there.
; 
; Totally miserable conditions prevailed both with the weather and 
; the fractal cats here at Fractal Central in central Pennsylvania 
; on Friday.  The spitting rain and temperature of 46F 8C kept the 
; cat duo glued to the warmest radiator, glaring at the outdoors 
; in full sulk.
; 
; My problem was not the weather -- I had no time to worry about 
; that -- but with the rush that won't go away.  I still managed 
; to find time for the fractal however.  And I would not be sur-
; prised in the least if another fractal were to show up in about 
; 24 hours.  Until next time, take care, and never question the 
; fractal truth.
