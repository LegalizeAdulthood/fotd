; FOTD -- April 15, 2009 (Rating 8.75)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows an apparently cubic minibrot caught in the 
; act of anti-iterating, a phenomenon that I recently discovered, 
; or more accurately heard about.  I named it "Planetary Nebula" 
; because it rather looks like one.
; 
; Anti-iteration is when the number of elements is repeatedly cut 
; in half as we approach a point of attraction, rather than 
; constantly doubling, as is the case with normal minibrots.  (A 
; planetary nebula is formed when a normal-sized star runs out of 
; nuclear fuel late in its life and puffs off its outer layers in 
; a gaseous shell until it finally collapses into a white dwarf.)
; 
; On the surface, the parent fractal of today's image resembles a 
; grossly oversized Mandelbrot set, but deep in its depths every-
; thing turns cubic.  Today's scene is located on a filament exten-
; ding southeast from the main bay of the third largest minibrot 
; on the main stem of the Mandelbrot-like parent, at a depth where 
; everything has become almost but not quite cubic.
; 
; The rating of an 8-3/4 includes 1/2 point for mathematical 
; interest and 1/4 point for the coloring.  The calculation time 
; of an incredibly fast 43 seconds will pass in an instant when 
; the top part of the image first appears.  Those with a high-
; speed connection to the internet may download the finished image 
; from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; in even less time.  Those with a dial-up connection may need to 
; wait a few seconds longer.
; 
; Clouds, rain and drizzle kept the fractal cats in a sour mood 
; all day Tuesday here at Fractal Central.  The temperature of 48F 
; 9C cheered them none at all.  Only a combination of tuna, turkey 
; and cheese made the duo bearable.
; 
; My day was a bit improved however -- the day's work went better 
; than expected.  If the luck holds, the next FOTD, which will be 
; posted in 24 hours, will also be better than expected.  Until 
; then, take care, and if the government gave everyone a tax 
; refund of one million dollars, all our economic problems would 
; instantly be solved as they went out and spent the money.
