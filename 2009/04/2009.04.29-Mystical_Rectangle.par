; FOTD -- April 29, 2009 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Tuesday was interesting here at Fractal Central.  FL and I were 
; at breakfast with the TV playing softly in the background, when 
; FL suddenly asked, "are we going to die?"  Without much thought, 
; I answered, "Of course," and FL exclaimed something like 'oh my 
; God!'  I was reading the paper, and did not realize that the 
; quarter-hourly swine-flu scare was being hyped on the TV morning 
; news show and she was referring to the flu scare.
; 
; When I realized what she was talking about, I assured her that 
; the whole doomsday atmosphere was created to get people to worry 
; so that they would spend more time watching the news channels 
; and thereby enable the stations to charge more for their adver-
; tising.  But the whole thing really started my philosophical 
; juices flowing.  I love mysteries, and next to the fourth dimen-
; sion, death must be the biggest mystery of all, so expect some 
; morbid musings in the not too distant future.
; 
; A more immediate concern is how to rate today's fractal.  After 
; at least 2 minutes of contemplation, I realized that I would 
; never be able to honestly rate the latest appearance of my old 
; friend, the rectangle in the Z^(2.003) Julibrot, so I rated it 
; as a question mark.
; 
; The name "Mystical Rectangle" refers to the mystery of trying to 
; determine the true four-dimensional shape of the object that is 
; rectangular in only two of its four dimensions.
; 
; Today's orientation is very close to the Julia direction, just 
; far enough removed to make the scene interesting.  I'm not sure 
; what slices the JulibrotZpwr formula cuts in Julibrot, but I 
; have never found similar slices with any of the other four-dimen-
; sional formulas.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/4 minutes is very fast.  Equally 
; fast is the trip to view the finished image on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The April heat wave continued here at Fractal Central on Tues-
; day.  The fractal cats made the most of things by avoiding the 
; hot sun and temperature of 90F 32C.  The humidity remained low 
; however, so the cats were reasonably happy.  My day started 
; slow, but turned busy when an unexpected job arrived around 10am.
; 
; Crises notwithstanding, the next FOTD fractal will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and why worry about the flu, 
; when the disease that will kill everyone is already out there.  
; It is not yet fully defined, but it is 100-percent fatal and 
; everyone is certain to contract it and die of it.  Its name is 
; 'something'.  (Don't blame me for mentioning the unpleasant and 
; inescapable truth!  I didn't make things this way.  The Big Guy 
; up in the sky did it, so blame Him.)
