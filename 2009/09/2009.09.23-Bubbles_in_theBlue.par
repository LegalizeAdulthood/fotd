; FOTD -- September 24, 2009 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; A FOTD fractal with a rating of a 9 is a rare beast, but today 
; we have one, a welcome relief from the string of 6 and 7 rated 
; images.
; 
; The parent fractal came about when I subtracted 0.2 part of 
; Z^(-7) from 0.2 part of Z^3 and added (1/C).  This parent 
; resembles nothing as much as a network looking like an overdone 
; pancake with various shaped holes scattered about.  The largest 
; hole is a twisted Mandelbrot set with a wedge pointed at its 
; East Valley.  Today's scene is located on the shoreline of this 
; wedge.
; 
; The unusual effect was achieved by rendering the scene with both 
; the outside and inside set to 'fmod' with a proximity of 1.  The 
; image is divided about 50-50 between inside and outside parts.
; 
; One glance at the image will show why I rated it at a 9.  A 
; second glance will explain the name "Bubbles in the Blue".
; 
; The calculation time of just over 1 minute will make taking the 
; glances a very brief task.  But there are always those overquali-
; fied computers that will not run DOS fractint.  Those with such 
; units may view the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; My Wednesday ponderings were on the four-dimensional phenomenon 
; known as double rotation, where an object such as a hypersphere 
; may be subject to two totally independent and distinct rotations 
; at the same time.  Of all the unvisualizable things possible in 
; 4-D space, this is perhaps the most intriguing, for unlike most 
; other 4-D stuff, it has no analog in 3-D space.
; 
; Morning sun gave way to afternoon clouds here at Fractal Central 
; on Wednesday, while the temperature reached a summer-like 82F 
; 28C.  The fractal cats are still more concerned with their power-
; ful new catnip rats than the weather.
; 
; My day was about average.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and what we need is a fractal tea 
; party.
