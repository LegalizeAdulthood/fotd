; FOTD -- September 16, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Back in my wonder years I sometimes wondered how long it would 
; take a space ship to reach infinity if it traveled at infinite 
; speed.  Sometime later I realized that the speed of light is in 
; effect infinite speed, since at light velocity the spatial 
; direction in which an object is moving contracts to zero, and 
; the trip, however long from our viewpoint, is accomplished 
; instantly.  I have yet to decide how long it would take to reach 
; infinity at the speed of light, but I now suspect the question 
; is a wrong one, based on a wrong assumption.  One thing certain 
; however is that from a photon's point of view, the photon does 
; not exist at all.  However great the distance it travels from 
; our point of view, in the photon's own world it is absorbed the 
; same moment it is emitted.
; 
; With a magnitude of over 2*10^(13), today's image is as close 
; to infinity as one is likely to come with the MandAutoCritInZ 
; formula and the Fractint program.  The magnitude inspired the 
; name "Conquest of Infinity".  Luckily, the mathtolerance entry 
; makes such an extreme magnitude reachable.  There is a minibrot 
; at the center, but it is far beyond resolution and I'm not sure 
; of what order it is.  The parent fractal has Z^2, Z^3, and Z^6 
; minibrots in the vicinity of today's image, so who knows what 
; lies unseen in the depths.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is above average.  We have had many ratings of 
; 7 recently, so many in fact that it is starting to become 
; boring.  The calculation time of 2-1/4 minutes is reasonable for 
; those with some time to spare.  Those with no spare time on 
; their hands may escape the task of calculating the included 
; parameter file and enjoy the image by viewing it on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The next several FOTD's will explore some of the fractal 
; craziness in the area of the parent fractal in which today's 
; image lies.  It makes no sense at all to see an order-6 minibrot 
; in a fractal created by combining Z^4 with 2 parts of Z^3, but 
; take my word, in today's parent fractal it does happen.  Well, I 
; guess anything is possible in the world of fractals.
; 
; Sunny skies and a temperature of 79F 26C made Tuesday a near-
; perfect day here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats agreed, 
; and if it had been a bit cooler, they would have spent the 
; afternoon on the sunniest shelf in the southwest window.
; 
; My day was average.  With only a little luck, tomorrow will be 
; the same.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and all too often one man's wisdom is another 
; man's nonsense.
