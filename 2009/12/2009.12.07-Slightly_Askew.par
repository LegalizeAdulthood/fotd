; FOTD -- December 08, 2009 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Slightly Askew".  The name does not 
; refer to the image.  It refers to the thinking of those who are 
; on a media-induced quest to save the earth from the presumed 
; imminent disaster of man-made global warming.
; 
; Today's FOTD is a lot hotter than the temperature rise.
; 
; The image shows a minibrot and its orangeish elements on a dark 
; blue background and surrounded by a field of scattered debris, 
; almost resembling a galactic cluster of stars.
; 
; In my opinion, the rating of a 8 is a bit exaggerated, though 
; some might consider it about right.
; 
; The parent fractal is a Mandelbrot set with large fir-tree 
; shaped holes at the end of its filaments.  Today's scene is 
; located in the East Valley area of this parent M-set.
; 
; The unusually brief calculation time of under 45 seconds makes 
; running the included parameter file almost a pleasure.  Absolute 
; pleasure may be found on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the completed image is posted.
; 
; Heavy clouds and occasional snowflakes prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central on Monday.  The temperature hovered around 34F 1C, which 
; made topcoats the order of the day.  The fractal cats made the 
; heat source the order of the day.
; 
; The work was finished just after lunch, which made me happy.  
; The day's fractal turned out to be acceptable, which increased 
; my pleasure.  FL, who cannot suppress her instinct that the 
; earth needs to be saved from global warming, was made unhappy 
; when she heard about the 'climategate' scandal on the midday 
; news.  But regardless of the future temperature or ocean levels, 
; the next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and run for your lives.  We'll soon be under 30 feet of 
; water.
