; FOTD -- December 04, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; A busy day here at FC on Thursday the 3rd means a brief 
; discussion for the FOTD for Friday the 4th.
; 
; The image is an admittedly two-dimensional scene in our old 
; friend, the Mandelbrot set, the mother of all fractals.  The 
; location is rather deep in the north branch of Seahorse Valley 
; of the large minibrot on the main stem of the even larger 
; minibrot at -1.75 on the main stem of the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; Since Mandelbrot-set scenes are so familiar, I gave the image 
; no rating.  But do not assume that the lack of a rating means 
; the image is worthless.  Go ahead, risk 8 seconds and run the 
; included parameter file.  The worst that can happen is a disap-
; pointing fractal.  And that 'delete' key is always available.
; 
; The name "In a Remote Valley" refers to the valley in which the 
; scene is located.
; 
; This is the electronic digital age, for what it is worth, so why 
; not take advantage of all the cyber-wizardry by taking a virtual 
; journey to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted for instant viewing.
; 
; Thursday was a mild day for December here at Fractal Central, 
; but heavy clouds and brisk winds made the temperature of 55F 12C 
; feel more like freezing.  The fractal cats must have agreed.  
; They spent most of the day by the heat.
; 
; My day was busier than we had expected, which explains why I 
; turned to the dependable Mandelbrot set for the FOTD.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care and 
; don't get bamboozled by the sensation-seeking media.
