; FOTD -- December 12, 2009 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies just beyond the large minibrot on the 
; infinitely-divided main stem of its parent fractal, which 
; closely resembles a Mandelbrot set, but is actually a mixture of 
; Z^(2) and Z^(2.05).
; 
; I named the image "The Unexpected".  Unexpected things often 
; turn up in fractals, but I doubt that I have ever seen an image 
; with as much varied and seemingly unconnected stuff lying around.
; 
; A minibrot does lie at the center of the image, but 
; unfortunately it is well beyond resolution.
; 
; I was totally puzzled as to how to rate the image.  I finally 
; let it go with a rating of a question mark, which means the 
; viewer's guess is as good as mine.
; 
; With so much variety in the image, I found it near impossible to 
; color satisfactorily.  Feel free to tweak the colors.  A better 
; palette might exist, though I lacked the time to find one.
; 
; The calculation time of under three minutes will give the eager 
; fractalist just enough time to prepare himself for the image.  A 
; bit of preparation is also recommended for those who choose to 
; avoid calculation by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; I think FL is finally coming around.  We were watching the news 
; at lunch on Friday, when a report about climate change came on.  
; After hearing of the dissenting opinions about global warming, 
; she asked if I thought we actually have the power to change the 
; earth's climate.  Not wanting to get into a debate with so much 
; graphics work yet to be finished, I answered 'probably not'.  
; But the comment got my philo-political juices flowing, so expect 
; a bit of political musing in the not-too-distant future.
; 
; Partly cloudy skies, biting winds and a temperature of 25F -4C 
; made Friday a day to forget here at Fractal Central.  The 
; fractal cats forgot the weather before the day even began, and 
; spent most of their time seeking the warmest spot around.
; 
; My day was rather busy.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  It is due to be posted then, but whether it appears on 
; time is up to fate.  Until the next time, take care, and let me 
; know when the greenies start discussing the real environmental 
; threat -- the earth's over-population.  When they demonstrate 
; that they know what the greatest threat to man's survival is, 
; then I'll start taking them more seriously.
