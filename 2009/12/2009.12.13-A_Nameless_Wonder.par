; FOTD -- December 13, 2009 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As expected, an antiquing trip arose from nowhere on Saturday, 
; and by the time the adventure was over, it was too late for a 
; proper fractal search.  Today's image came about almost automati-
; cally, which is why I could rate it no better than a below-
; average 4.
; 
; The parent fractal is a Mandelbrot set, or more accurately, the 
; east half of a Mandelbrot set.  Today's image is found in the 
; partially eroded East Valley area of this parent fractal.
; 
; The name "A Nameless Wonder" might itself be considered a name, 
; creating an apparent logical paradox, but then everything I say 
; is untrue, so why worry ourselves about it.
; 
; The calculation time of a little over 4 minutes is not at all 
; too much time to expect the ardent fractalist to devote to the 
; calculation.  Those who eschew ardency may see the finished 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Saturday was near-perfect here at Fractal Central, but FL and I 
; were away all day, so I can only assume the fractal cats enjoyed 
; the sun and temperature of 36F 2C.
; 
; Sunday began with light rain and a sheet of ice covering every-
; thing in sight.  In the afternoon the temperature rose just far 
; enough above freezing to melt the ice, and then the setting sun 
; broke through the clouds to end the day in a non-violent blaze 
; of glory.  The fractal cats took the day's weather in stride, 
; keeping within a quick dash of the heat, of course.
; 
; For me, both days were quite busy with Christmas stuff.  The 
; next FOTD is due in a couple hours.  Needless to say, it will 
; not be posted on time.  Until whenever, take care, and bet your 
; money on the warming side of the climate debate.
