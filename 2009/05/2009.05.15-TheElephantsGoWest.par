; FOTD -- May 15, 2009 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; We have just seen the weird rectangular things that appear on 
; the negative stem of the Z^2.003 Mandeloid.  But what would 
; happen if the parent fractal were rotated 180 degrees so that 
; East Valley lies on the negative stem?  At a height of 1050 
; steps up the logarithmic hyperladder, the MandelbrotBC3 formula 
; does just that.
; 
; When East Valley lies on the negative stem it spreads out into a 
; wedge, while the elephant stuff along its north and south edges 
; breaks up into a series of circular herringbone things.  Today's 
; scene with its circular herring bones lies in the debris between 
; two larger herring bones.
; 
; Unfortunately, the image proved almost impossible to color satis-
; factorily.  It is far too chaotic to produce any kind of smooth-
; ness to contrast with its over abundance of chaos.  As a result, 
; I could rate it no higher than a 5.  More work might have found 
; better colors, but I had no time to search.
; 
; The name "The Elephants Go West" describes the 180-degree trip 
; taken by the normally eastward-bound elephants before they 
; reached today's state of decay on the west end of the fractal.
; 
; The calculation time of 6 minutes, 6 and 66/100ths seconds has a 
; lot of sixes in it.  I guess it could be a sign that the beast 
; is prowling nearby.  To avoid the wrath of the beast, it is best 
; to calculate the parameter file with caution.
; 
; The image may be seen risk-free by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it is or soon will be posted for immediate bliss.
; 
; Heavy clouds, high winds and frequent heavy showers spoiled the 
; otherwise pleasant temperature of 68F 20C here at Fractal 
; Central on Thursday.  The fractal cats were so distracted by two 
; prowling tomcats that got into a fight in the side yard that 
; they never noticed the inclement weather.
; 
; My day was acceptable, but FL got a bit cranky when dirty 
; pictures started popping up on one of the computers.  I think 
; the bug has now been cleared out, but only time will tell.  The 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and I didn't realize the 666 beast was into fractals.
