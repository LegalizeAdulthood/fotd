; FOTD -- May 05, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a very hasty one because I spent all day Monday 
; reworking one of last week's rush jobs.  When it became apparent 
; that all mankind was not going to die of the 'swine' flu, one of 
; our customers decided to totally re-do his job to remove the 
; possible impression that he expected an imminent repeat of 1918. 
; It should have been obvious to him from the start that this flu 
; scare was just another media-created big-news event designed to 
; keep viewers worried and glued to the news channels.  I barely 
; finished today's re-do job in time to scrape up a below-average 
; fractal.
; 
; I avoid giving unusually low ratings to the FOTD images by not 
; rating the ones that fall too far short.  Today's image falls 
; pretty far short, and therefore gets no rating at all.  The 
; scene is located near the negative X-axis of the Z^(3.003)+C 
; Mandeloid, in an area that is rapidly fragmenting.  There is 
; nothing very new in the scene.  I have posted similar images 
; several times before.
; 
; The name "All Cracked Up" describes my first impression of the 
; image.  The calculation time of 6-1/3 minutes is too much to 
; spend on such a mediocre image.  I strongly recommend saving the 
; time by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A steady all-day rain and temperature of 54F 12C kept the 
; fractal cats suppressed here at Fractal Central on Monday.  The 
; rain also kept FL suppressed.  The un-necessary work kept me 
; suppressed.
; 
; The next FOTD, hopefully not suppressed, will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and I heard on TV that if you die 
; as a result of taking a certain drug, you should call a lawyer 
; to see if you have legal rights.
