; FOTD -- May 19, 2009 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is a Mandelbrot set caught 
; in the act of devolving into the circular hole created by the 
; iterated non-formula Z+C.  This halfway fractal is shaped like a 
; tear drop with a tiny extra bay on the smooth shore line of its 
; pointed east end.  (I suspect that this tiny extra bay is actu-
; ally the extremely shrunken main bay.)
; 
; The west side of the parent fractal has the expected Mandelbrot 
; buds along its shore.  Today's scene is located near the tip of 
; a filament extending from one of these buds.
; 
; The shape of the parent fractal is symmetrical with respect to 
; the X-axis, though the bands of the outside=imag coloring 
; feature are not.  Therefore, changing the sign of the Y coordi-
; nate while keeping the absolute value unchanged brings an 
; entirely different color scheme to the mirrored same scene.
; 
; The name "Tardy Technicality" has little meaning.  And why must 
; a name have meaning or even make sense.  (Remember the song 
; 'Stairway to Heaven'.)  
; 
; The rating of 7-1/2 indicates that the image is good but not 
; exceptional.  One half of the rating is a reward for the effort 
; I put into the coloring.
; 
; The calculation time of 7 minutes is slightly slow, but nothing 
; that will cause civilization to grind to a halt.  And even the 
; small effort of running the included parameter file may be 
; avoided by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The partly cloudy skies were compromised by an unusually chilly 
; temperature of 57F 14C here at Fractal Central on Monday.  The 
; fractal cats made themselves comfortable by the heat, which came 
; on again for an hour.  My day was quite busy, but concluded 
; successfully.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, with or without the 
; approval of the cats.  Until then, take care, and be careful of 
; what you think.  Your thoughts are being monitored for illegal 
; traces of hate.
