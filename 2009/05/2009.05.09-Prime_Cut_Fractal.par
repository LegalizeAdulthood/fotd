; FOTD -- May 09, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a Z^11+C minibrot gone crazy.  The parent 
; fractal is a grossly inflated Mandelbrot set that is quadratic 
; only on the surface.  Once we dive any depth into it, the M-set 
; takes on Z^11 characteristics.  Today's image is located in the 
; East Valley area of a tiny minibrot just beyond the spike of the 
; large minibrot on the main spike of the parent almost-Mandelbrot 
; set.
; 
; I chose the image to be FOTD for May 9 because it is one of the 
; most decorative higher-order minibrots I have ever stumbled 
; upon.  The name "Prime-Cut Fractal" means little beyond its 
; sound.  The rating of a 7 is just about FOTD average.  The calcu-
; lation time of 10-1/4 minutes is slower than FOTD average, but 
; may be avoided by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; In yesterday's discussion I told of a book-club offering of a 
; book about the imminent collapse of civilization due to climate 
; change (AKA global warming).  Since then I have checked more of 
; the books being offered.  I found one about 'the myth of the 
; self'.
; 
; According to the author of this book, there is no such thing as 
; 'the self'.  What we perceive as the conscious 'self' is the 
; content of a sophisticated model of reality generated by our 
; brains.  Whenever our brains successfully pursue the strategy of 
; creating a unified and dynamic inner portrait of reality, we 
; become conscious.  In a sense, conscious experience is a form of 
; virtual reality, a real-time world-model that can be viewed as a 
; permanent simulation.  (A lot of fancy words indeed!)
; 
; It's probably an interesting book, but I'll not order it.  The 
; author has apparently not bridged the gap between neurons and 
; consciousness.  I wonder what the non-existent but always-the-
; same thing is supposed to be, which he claims appears from 
; nowhere to become our illusory selves when our brains begin 
; 'creating a unified and dynamic inner portrait of reality', 
; whatever that means.
; 
; Also, if conscious experience is a form of virtual reality and 
; the world we appear to experience around us is a permanent simu-
; lation, as the author apparently supposes, then the brain that 
; he claims creates the simulation must itself be a part of the 
; simulation.
; 
; I see circular reasoning once again taking the place of true 
; critical thinking.  One of these years someone might actually 
; bridge the gap between brain and mind, if one actually exists, 
; but it will not be in the year 2009.
; 
; I have been reading books attempting to explain self-awareness 
; for many years, and in that time I have seen the explanations 
; grow ever more preposterous and unconvincing.  The only thing I 
; have become convinced of is that our science is missing some-
; thing of monumental importance, most likely non-physical, though 
; not necessarily the teachings of any one religion.
; 
; A mixture of clouds and sun here at Fractal Central on Friday, 
; and a temperature of 77F 25C were enough to keep the fractal 
; cats' crankiness under control.  Light rain in the evening 
; caused no problems, while less work than expected kept me under 
; control.
; 
; If all stays under control, the next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and after all these years, our 
; greatest thinkers can't even tell us what we are.  It's almost 
; unbelievable
