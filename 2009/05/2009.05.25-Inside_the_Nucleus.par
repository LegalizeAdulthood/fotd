; FOTD -- May 25, 2009 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image, which is a slight reworking of an earlier FOTD 
; image, reminds me of what one might see if he could shrink 
; himself to the size of an atomic nucleus.  In my earlier years I 
; pictured the nucleus as a boiling raspberry, but this was before 
; I realized that things like atomic raspberries and tiny solar 
; systems are mere ideas, models that help us think logically 
; about the atomic realm.
; 
; Atoms and sub-atomic 'particles' cannot be pictured because they 
; lack the attributes we associate with 'reality', including 
; appearance.  The mere fact that we sometimes wonder whether 
; atoms are truly tiny real 'objects' or mere mental fantasy shows 
; that we have no conception of what lies beneath the classical 
; world of the five senses, another fantasy world, upon which 
; materialists have bestowed the exalted status of 'ultimate 
; reality'.
; 
; Today's image is definitely virtually real and it has a definite 
; appearance.  It is the Julia set of the Z^(1.3) Mandeloid as it 
; appears 3 levels up the logarithmic ladder.  Most of the action 
; was achieved by rendering the scene with the inside set to bof61.
; 
; The name "Inside the Nucleus" refers to my impression of the 
; image.  Even though the image is a virtual repeat, in my opinion 
; it still rates an 8.  And the calculation time of only 16 
; seconds will seem to pass in a chronon.
; 
; The finished image is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Oppressive heat and humidity here at Fractal Central on Sunday 
; was interrupted at 5pm by a heavy but otherwise harmless thunder-
; shower, which dropped the temperature from 86F 30C to 68F 20C.  
; The fractal cats paid little attention to the rain.
; 
; My day was spent mostly in recovery from Saturday's trip to 
; O.F.C.  The next FOTD will probably be posted on schedule in 
; about 8 hours.  Until then, take care, and what do we mean by 
; meaning?
