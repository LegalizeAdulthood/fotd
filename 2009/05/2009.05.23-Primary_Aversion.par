; FOTD -- May 23, 2009 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is an improvement over yesterday's, though not as 
; much of an improvement as I had hoped for.  It's an evaporated 
; scene in the parent fractal that results when various portions 
; of Z^(-1.15) and Z^(-5.5) are combined and (1/C) is added.
; 
; The obvious flaw is the raggedness.  I was a bit too enthusias-
; tic with the magnitude and went too far beyond the limit of 
; resolution.  But the jagged edges can actually be taken as a 
; part of the texture, so I inserted the mathtolerance entry into 
; the parameter file and let it go.
; 
; Like so many of the names I give to the FOTD images, the name of 
; today's image, "Primary Aversion" means nothing more than what 
; the viewer might put into it.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is 2 points higher than yesterday's abysmal 4, 
; but still only the slightest bit above average.  The calculation 
; time of 3-1/2 minutes is true on the 2000mhz unit.  On other 
; machines the parameter file will run faster or slower.
; 
; And as always, the finished image is posted on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Midsummer arrived in full force here at Fractal Central on 
; Friday, with near total sun and a temperature of 88F 31C.  The 
; fractal cats spent most of the day watching the local stray cats 
; attacking the catnip mint plants FL planted in her garden the 
; evening before.  By the end of the day, the catnip was gone and 
; the neighborhood cats were quite happy.  My day was near average.
; 
; The next FOTD might not be posted until midday Sunday, since 
; I'll be making a short trip back to Old Fractal Central on 
; Saturday.  Until whenever, take care, and have a good time.
