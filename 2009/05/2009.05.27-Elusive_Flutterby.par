; FOTD -- May 27, 2009 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image came about when I took a second look at the parent 
; fractal that results when various portions of negative 1.5 and 
; negative 5 are combined and (1/C) is added.  Like most fractals 
; that combine negative exponents, this parent is beyond descrip-
; tion, though it is quite simple to reproduce.
; 
; I chose to investigate a tiny valley on the northwest shore line 
; of the southernmost large bay, which appears to have the best 
; developed Mandelbrot characteristics.  In a matter of minutes I 
; found a minibrot very near the limit of resolution, which became 
; today's FOTD.
; 
; I named the image "Elusive Flutterby" when for some reason it 
; reminded me of a butterfly.  I believe this class of insects 
; were originally called flutterbys.  The rating of a 7.5 might 
; stretch the truth a little, but what the heck.  Sometimes I 
; stretch the truth quite a lot.
; 
; At least the calculation time has not been stretched.  It took 
; an entire 5 minutes to calculate the image on the fast 2000mhz 
; machine.  And don't forget the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image is or momentarily will be posted for immediate 
; and absolutely total gratification.
; 
; Heavy clouds, steady rain, and a chilly temperature of 54F 12C 
; kept things well dampened here at Fractal Central on Tuesday.  
; The fractal cats' spirits were especially well dampened, but an 
; extra treat of tuna and cheddar took their minds off the bad 
; weather, and a dose of fresh catnip kept their minds off the 
; weather.
; 
; For me it was a back to work day.  Luckily, the work was not 
; very heavy, and was out of the way just after lunch.  To fill 
; the afternoon I watched one of the junkiest of junky old sci-fi 
; movies, "The Creeping Terror", which is so bad that it must be 
; seen to be believed.  Actually, the movie's awefulness gave me 
; just the push I needed to find today's image.  The next FOTD 
; image will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; since dreams happen inside the brain, how is it possible to 
; dream of something too large to fit in the brain?
