; FOTD -- May 02, 2009 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Friday began with the discovery via e-mail that an unknown 
; relative had died in England and left me over 2-million pounds. 
; All I need to do is send a check for 725 dollars to the lawyer 
; holding the money, and he will forward the 2-million pounds to 
; me.  The money I am to send will cover the legal work and trans-
; fer fees.
; 
; I replied, telling the lawyer to deduct the transfer fees from 
; my 2-million pounds and send the remainder to me.  I expect to 
; be a millionaire within 2 weeks!  But just in case something 
; goes wrong, I have not yet given up my regular income, nor have 
; I given up finding fractals.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is not a cubic Mandeloid, it 
; is a pretty much normal, though oversized, traditional Mandel-
; brot set.  There is nothing normal about the large minibrot on 
; the negative spike however.  Its main bay has split into at 
; least 3 sections, and its East Valley has split into 2 East 
; Valleys.  Today's scene is located very deep in a looping 
; filament in the northern East Valley.
; 
; At the extreme magnitude of over 7*(10^11), all traces of the 
; quadratic parent have long since vanished.  The image is purely 
; cubic.  Actually, it's a rather interesting cubic scene, with 
; areas of mass chaos contrasting with areas of boring flatness.
; 
; I named the image "Fanciful Cubical" because I feel the cubic 
; Mandeloids are under-appreciated.  After all, they are the 
; runner-ups to the champion of all fractals, the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; I rated the image at a 7-1/2, which includes 1/2 point for the 
; coloring.  The calculation time of just over 7 minutes may be 
; cut to zero by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the completed image there.
; 
; Cloudy skies and light rain did not dampen the spirits of the 
; fractal cats here at Fractal Central on Friday.  The temperature 
; of 68F 20C was just about the middle of their comfort zone.
; 
; With the health-care rush out of the way, and the flu panic 
; showing signs of subsiding, my day was average.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and anyone who thinks I'm going to get 2-million dollars 
; should send me 2-thousand dollars and I'll give him half the 
; 2-million.
