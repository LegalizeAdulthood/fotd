; FOTD -- May 16, 2009 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The complex logarithm is multi-valued, so how then do we know 
; which value is the correct one?  The answer is that they are all 
; 'correct'.  The square roots of 4 are plus-2 and minus-2, and 
; they are both 'correct'.  We use the root that works best in the 
; situation at hand, which is almost always the plus-2 root.  The 
; same is true with the complex logarithms, but the other values 
; are always there, and they also make fractals.
; 
; The MandelbrotBC3 formula makes use of these other values of the 
; complex logarithm.  Each value draws a different fractal, even 
; when the exponent of Z remains unchanged.  In today's image we 
; have gone 30 levels up the logarithmic ladder to a level where 
; the Z^(1.5)+C parent Mandeloid is totally changed.  Today's 
; image is located in the 'Seahorse Valley' of its parent.
; 
; Since most of the effect is a result of the coloring, which I 
; put at least 10 minutes work into, I have added the usual 1/2 
; point bonus for the coloring, bringing the overall rating to a 
; less-than-inspiring 6-1/2.  The name "Unity and a Half" refers 
; to the exponent of Z.
; 
; The calculation time of a shockingly fast 44 seconds will bring 
; no discomfort to even the most fastidious.  The trip out to the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to see the finished image there will be equally enjoyable.
; 
; The showers moved out of the Fractal Central area early Thursday 
; night, leading to a foggy start for Friday.  By 10am the fog 
; cleared out however, and the rest of the day was near perfect, 
; with blue skies, puffy clouds, and a temperature of 77F 25C.  
; The fractal cats enjoyed the weather conditions, but they were 
; not happy when a lovesick tomcat wandered by and sprayed the 
; wall right beneath their favorite window.  A quick squirt from 
; the hose removed the offensive odor and restored the cats' good 
; moods.  My day was busier than expected, in fact it was barely 
; under control.
; 
; Unless FL gets an antiquing urge, the next FOTD will be posted 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be conservatively 
; liberal.
