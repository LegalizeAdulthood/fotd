; FOTD -- May 06, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; NEW FORMULA ALERT!
; 
; Today's image uses a new formula, the DivideBrot5a.  When the 
; 'recip' function is used, this formula does the same things as 
; the old DivideBrot5 formula, but does them about 10-percent 
; faster.  In addition, the changeable function adds much more 
; flexibility.
; 
; Unfortunately, the continuing busy period here at Fractal 
; Central has kept me from exploring the things that happen when 
; the function is changed, but the rush is near an end, and I 
; expect some interesting images from this new formula in the near 
; future.
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the Seahorse Valley area of its 
; parent fractal, which is a distorted Mandelbrot set, with cubic 
; features just beneath the surface.  The circular features in the 
; background of the image were created by rendering it with the 
; inside set to 'fmod' and a proximity of 0.007.
; 
; I gave the image a rather side-show sounding name -- "The Mighty 
; Cubic"  And then I rated it at a 7, which is just about FOTD 
; average.  The calculation time of 7-1/2 minutes is slow, but not 
; unbearably so, and the finished image is posted, as always, for 
; instant viewing on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather was dry Tuesday here at Fractal Central, but the 
; heavy clouds that hung overhead all day and the temperature of 
; 57F 14C kept the fractal cats in a sullen mood.  Nicholas got so 
; out of sorts that he cussed me with the 'hiss' word when I tried 
; to comfort him.  Cassie simply found a soft cushion, curled up 
; and slept for most of the day.
; 
; My day was busy, though not as bad as Monday, and with FL unable 
; to do garden work, I got a bit of help.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted, if all goes well, in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and where is Hilbert space?
