; FOTD -- May 08, 2009 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The following was written to the Fractint list a few days ago in 
; reference to the curious rectangle in a Julia set of the Z^2.003 
; Mandeloid:
; 
; >The name "Mystical Rectangle" refers to the mystery of trying 
; >to determine the true four-dimensional shape of the object that 
; >is rectangular in only two of its four dimensions.  Well, if 
; >the 4th dimension is time, I don't see what is meant here.
; 
; Actually I should have written "rectangular in only two of its 
; four *spatial* dimensions".  If time is included as a dimension, 
; then the mysterious rectangle thing is actually 5-dimensional.
; 
; >The flu appears to be a flop.
; 
; Yep! . . . a predictable flop.
; 
; >Don't worry about climate change or cholesterol either -- all 
; >these things are manufactured by the puppet masters to keep the 
; >little people with little minds from daring to contemplate the 
; >real things that matter and actually try thinking for 
; >themselves.
; 
; If it wasn't so true, it would be a dark comedy.
; 
; In the mail this morning I received the latest offering from one 
; of the puppet masters, the Scientific American Book Club.  This 
; month's selection is a book about the coming climate change dis-
; aster.  In the promotional magazine, I see that global heating 
; may all but eliminate people from the earth.  The blurb goes on 
; to forecast a disastrous rise in sea levels, leading to the de-
; struction of major cities and the failure of food supplies.  The 
; resulting flood of refugees from uninhabitable areas will lead 
; to a climate war, which will throw the survivors back to a stone-
; age existence.  I'm not buying the book, but it likely calls for 
; lots of political action of the liberal kind A.S.A.P.
; 
; Now I need a couple minutes to stop worrying! . . .
; 
; . . . OK, Now I've calmed down! . . .
; 
; . . . Some of the things that are always safe are fractals, 
; which emit no deadly radiation or cancer-causing chemicals.  
; Today's image is quite a nice example of a perfectly safe 
; fractal.  It shows a variation of that mysterious Z^2.003 rectan-
; gle, which has been slightly distorted by changing the exponent 
; to Z^2.0032.
; 
; With careful coloring I have made the rectangle into a view of 
; a Rene Magritte-ish window in the night sky.  I named the image 
; "Window in the Sky" and rated it at a 7-1/2, which includes the 
; usual 1/2 point for the coloring.
; 
; The calculation time of 56 seconds could hardly be faster.  The 
; finishe dimage has also been posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather stayed dry here at Fractal Central on Thursday, and 
; the temperature reached a pleasant 72F 22C, but the sun was 
; actually shining for only 15 minutes, which was far too short a 
; time to satisfy the fractal cats, who spent a good part of the 
; afternoon sulking in the most prominent places they could find.  
; Nicholas chose the doorway between the living room and the hall-
; way, while Cassie chose my TV chair.  It took an extra treat of 
; tuna and sharp cheddar cheese to pull them out of their funks.
; 
; Otherwise, my day was about average, and FL managed an hour or 
; so in her garden, which is about average.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours, which is even more average.  Until then, 
; take care, and relax, all is well.  Cell phones are as safe as 
; the tobacco companies once told us cigarettes are.
