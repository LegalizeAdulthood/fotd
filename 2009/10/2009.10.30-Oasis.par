; FOTD -- October 31, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; We end the month of October with another blast from the distant 
; past -- May, 1997 to be exact -- when virtually the same image 
; appeared under the name "Martian".  To update the image I have 
; slightly re-cropped it, tweaked a few colors, and changed the 
; outside to 'real'.
; 
; The name "Oasis" refers to a slight tinge of green on the 
; horizon at the left edge of the image, which I took to be a 
; distant oasis of green on the otherwise desolate planet Mars.  
; Or it could be the desert planet otherwise known as 'Dune' in 
; the well-known series of fantasy novels pretending to be science 
; fiction.
; 
; Since the image is another repeat, I gave it no rating.
; 
; There is not much more to be said about the image, which speaks 
; for itself, other than repeating that the way to see it is to 
; run the included parameter file and wait 30 seconds, or to surf 
; out to the glorious FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the completed image in relaxed serenity there.
; 
; The Friday weather here at Fractal Central was a repeat of the 
; past 2 days' conditions -- heavy clouds but dry, and a tempera-
; ture of 55F 13C.  The fractal cats gave up early and spent the 
; rest of the day in the coziest warm places they could find.
; 
; For me the day was just one more in a seemingly endless string 
; of routine days.  (Not that I find anything wrong with this.)  
; If all goes well, and even if it doesn't, the next FOTD, the 
; first of a new month, will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and don't judge another until you have walked in his 
; shoes, (or something like that).
