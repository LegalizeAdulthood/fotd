; FOTD -- October 18, 2009 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Little can be said about today's image, which must be seen to be 
; believed.  Unmatched in its extravagance, it is truly an image, 
; that speaks for itself.
; 
; The parent fractal also must be seen to be believed.  The most 
; incredible part of this Mandelbrot set parent is that only half 
; of it is there.  The western half has moved on to a higher 
; dimension, and has been replaced by a field of scattered stars 
; and planets.
; 
; Today's image is located just beyond the large period-5 bud 
; on the northwest shore line of the main bay of the parent 
; half-M-set, almost exactly on the line where the M-set is 
; vanishing.  It is located a curious area of chaos in the East 
; Valley of a larger minibrot.
; 
; There is so much of interest in the image that I failed to find 
; a single theme in it that might inspire a name.  I finally named 
; it "Simply Outstanding", which says it all. 
; 
; Actually, the colors of the image are a bit too disorganized to 
; earn a top rating.  The rating of 8-1/2 is high enough however.
; 
; The chief drawback is the calculation time of over 22 minutes, 
; though this time may be cut to a minute or so by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; But due to the odd hour of this posting, give Paul a chance to 
; get it posted on the site.
; 
; Heavy clouds and a steady cold rain mixed with a few snowflakes 
; left Saturday a day with much to be desired here at Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cats were so disgusted that they passed 
; most of the day squatted down and sulking.
; 
; Except for the better-than-expected fractal, my day was 
; uneventful.  The next FOTD will be posted in 8 hours, more or 
; less.  Until then, take care, and when the going gets tough, get 
; tough and get going.
