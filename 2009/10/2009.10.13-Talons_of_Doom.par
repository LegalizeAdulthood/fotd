; FOTD -- October 14, 2009 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is not a scene in any Mandelbrot set, warped or 
; otherwise.  It is a an oblique scene in the Z^2+C Julibrot, 
; which encompasses all the warped Mandelbrot sets as well as all 
; the Julia sets.  The orientation of the image is double-rotated 
; 5 and 5 degrees from the true Julia direction.
; 
; The banded effect of the foreground elements was achieved with 
; the 'ranges' feature of Fractint, a little used and probably 
; almost unknown feature.  The three-dimensional effect of ghostly 
; half-obscured Mandelbrot buds in the background arises because 
; points that do not escape will eventually settle into the same 
; orbits regardless of where they begin their journeys.
; 
; The rating of a 5 indicates that I'm not very satisfied with the 
; image, which is not quite worth the 8 minutes required to run 
; the parameter file.
; 
; The name "Talons of Doom" refers to the talon-like effect of the 
; converging foreground stuff on the right side of the image.
; 
; The most convenient way to view the image, as always, is to view 
; it in finished form on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Tuesday here at Fractal Central was marked by dark scudding 
; strato-cumulus clouds and blustery northwest winds.  The 
; temperature of 61F 16C felt more like 50F 10C.  The fractal cats 
; needed an extra tuna treat to keep their spirits up.
; 
; My day was spoiled (or made) when I got into a heated political 
; discussion, which I might elaborate on and post on the philo-
; fractal list in a day or two.  (Politics sure can be fun.)  The 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and maybe I should win the Nobel Prize for easy fractals.
