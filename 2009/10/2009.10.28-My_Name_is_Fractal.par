; FOTD -- October 29, 2009 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To begin, let me make it perfectly clear that my name is not 
; Fractal -- the name of today's image is "My Name is Fractal".  
; Now that this perplexing problem has been solved, let's turn 
; to the FOTD image of the day.
; 
; To begin, the image lies in the parent fractal that is created 
; when various parts of Z^(-10) and (1/Z) are combined and (1/C) 
; is added.  This fractal resembles nothing as much as an over-
; sized splat.
; 
; The rating of a 6 seems about right.  The image is nothing that 
; we haven't seen countless times before.  The calculation time of 
; 3-1/4 minutes is perhaps a bit longer than the result is worth, 
; but what the heck, those who do not calculate the parameter file 
; will never know what they missed.
; 
; The way out of this quandary is to make a quick trip to the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and enjoy the finished image there without the task of running 
; the parameter file.
; 
; On Wednesday afternoon FL made one of those comments that gets 
; me thinking.  I wrote a few politically-oriented paragraphs that 
; I intended to post here, but I counted to 10, and then, to avoid 
; an off-topic debate, I deleted them.  After all, what more could 
; I add to what is already filling the news?
; 
; Wednesday here at Fractal Central started with rain and ended 
; with clouds.  The temperature of 61F 16C would have been fine if 
; the sun had been shining.  The fractal cats gave up early and 
; spent most of the day searching for places to curl up and sleep.
; 
; After deleting my original political comment, my day was quiet 
; enough.  As for the next FOTD -- look for it in about 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and the elimination of sickness and death 
; would solve the health-insurance problem, but it would be bad 
; news indeed for the health insurance industry.
