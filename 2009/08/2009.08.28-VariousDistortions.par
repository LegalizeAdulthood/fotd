; FOTD -- August 29, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Check the philofractal list for a longer discussion.
; 
; Today's image is more a fractal study than any kind of art work. 
; But as a combination of Z^2 and Z^(-2) it is still worth a look.
; 
; The image is named "Various Distortions".  I gave it this name 
; when I saw in it the three types of distortion that can afflict 
; Mandeloids.  These distortions surely have sound mathematical 
; causes, but other than the non-critical type of distortion, I 
; have no idea what these causes might be.
; 
; The first type of distortion appears in the dark Mandeloid 
; fragments vaguely showing in the background in the northeast and 
; southeast parts of the fractal.  This distortion appears when 
; the starting point of Z is set to a non-critical value.  This 
; particular distortion can be readily seen by calculating the 
; type=mandel Mandelbrot set and setting the parameters to 
; something between zero and one.  The distortion simply cuts off 
; part of the set.
; 
; The second type of distortion is clearly visible in the two 
; prominent Mandeloids on the X-axis.  In the Mandeloid on the 
; left, the main period-2 bud is too large and the higher-order 
; buds are bunched toward East Valley, while in the Mandeloid on 
; the right, the main bud is too small and the higher-order buds 
; are spread out toward the main bud.  I have no idea of the 
; mathematical cause.
; 
; The last type of distortion is visible in the two smaller 
; asymmetrical Mandeloids at the top and bottom of the image.  
; In this case the entire system of buds is skewed to one side or 
; the other.  In the buds in the image, this skewing is not too 
; severe, but it sometimes becomes so severe that the main 
; period-2 bud is impossible to find without checking the actual 
; orbits of the points.  Once again I have no idea of the cause.
; 
; Since the image is more a mathematical study than a work of art, 
; I could give it no rating.  But with a calculation time of under 
; 15 seconds, at least on my recently rehabilitated middle-aged 
; 2000mhz machine, there is no reason for anyone to miss seeing 
; the distortion.
; 
; Of course, the trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; is still more fun than calculation.
; 
; Heavy clouds and periods of rain spoiled Friday here at Fractal 
; Central.  The temperature of 70F 21C was irrelevant. The fractal 
; cats checked the outside several times, but when they saw too 
; much rain and no sign of the end of the world. they went back to 
; sleep.
; 
; My day was rather busy but not frantically so.  The next FOTD is 
; scheduled to be posted in 24 hours.  If an unexpected antiquing 
; expedition comes up, the FOTD might be delayed however.  Until 
; next time, take care, and prepare.
