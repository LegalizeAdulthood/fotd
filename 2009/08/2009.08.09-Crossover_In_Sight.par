; FOTD -- August 10, 2009 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With so many things going wrong on Sunday, it's a wonder that 
; today's FOTD image was posted at all.  My main alibi is the 
; weather, which caused a power outage in the evening.
; 
; The center of attraction in the very hasty image is a quintic 
; minibrot surrounded by an unbalanced field of not-particularly-
; attractive elements.  The coloring is barely adequate, with 
; nothing of note to comment on.
; 
; I named the image "Crossover In Sight" because the scene is 
; located in an area where two broad valleys appear to cross.  One 
; glance will reveal why I gave it no rating.  The calculation 
; time of 10-1/2 minutes makes the image not worth the time spent 
; calculating it.  To avoid disappointment I recommend viewing the 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather on Saturday was near perfect here at Fractal 
; Central, with mostly sunny skies and a temperature of 81F 27C.  
; But Sunday was a different story.  The day began with heavy 
; rain, then turned very muggy around noon, when the sun suddenly 
; burst through and the temperature soared to 88F 31C.  At 4pm 
; however the western sky grew almost as dark as night, followed 
; in a couple minutes by a violent thunder-storm, which caused a 
; six-hour power outage and made the already late FOTD even later. 
; We survived the storm with minimum damage, though FL's garden 
; took a beating.  The fractal cats took most of it in stride but 
; cringed at the loudest thunder claps.
; 
; If all goes well the next FOTD will be posted soon.  But from 
; the way things are going, I'm making no definite promises.  
; Until next time, whenever that is, take care, and be cool.
