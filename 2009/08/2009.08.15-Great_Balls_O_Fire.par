; FOTD -- August 16, 2009 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Saturday was another busy day here at Fractal Central, which 
; explains but does not excuse the briefness of the discussion.
; 
; Today we have another average FOTD fractal.  But a rating of an 
; average 6.5 does not mean totally without value.
; 
; The parent fractal came to be when (1/Z) was subtracted from 0.5 
; part of Z^(-2) and (1/C) was added.  This parent consists of 
; three main bays, two with Mandeloid shore lines and one with a 
; smooth shore line.  Today's scene lies in a valley between one 
; of the Mandeloid-edged bays and the smooth-edged bay.
; 
; Most of the effect was created by rendering the image with the 
; inside set to 'bof61' and the outside set to 'tdis'.  The image 
; consists of about 50-50 outside-inside stuff.
; 
; The rating of a 6.5 could easily have been a 7 if I had given 
; more effort to the coloring.  The calculation time of a slow 7 
; minutes is a bit more than the effort is worth, so I recommend 
; viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Summer came on strong here at Fractal Central on Saturday, as 
; the temperature reached 90F 32C, with high humidity and a lack 
; of a breeze making the heat seem even more oppressive.  The 
; fractal cats passed the day stretched on the cool tile floor in 
; the bathroom.
; 
; My day was quite active, but things should be back to normal 
; within a day.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and why is it considered spiritual for a person 
; to talk to God in prayer, but crazy for that person to hear God 
; talk to him.
