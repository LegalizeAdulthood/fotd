; FOTD -- August 12, 2009 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is another 7-rated one.  It's becoming boring, but 
; that's what I've been coming up with lately.  The scene lies in 
; the East Valley of the cut-off minibrot on the right side of 
; yesterday's image.
; 
; I named the image "A Good Dry Valley".  The name implies that it 
; is one of the best dry valleys I have yet found -- unusually 
; rich in interesting elements.  I give the name 'dry valley' to 
; areas of two-way symmetry that look as though they lead to 
; minibrots, but die out before getting there.  Actually, I am not 
; sure that today's dry valley is truly dry.  I have taken it to 
; the limit of resolution and discovered that it did not yet run 
; dry, so a minibrot might indeed lie at its center.  One of these 
; days I might check deeper with arbitrary math, though it will 
; not be today or tomorrow.
; 
; The rating of a 7 means I consider the image to be of average 
; worth.  The calculation time of 5 minutes is barely justified by 
; the result.  If justice is what you want, go to the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and give the world its comeuppance there.
; 
; The heat was a bit more reasonable here at Fractal Central on 
; Tuesday, when the temperature reached only 88F 31C.  But it was 
; still enough to keep the fractal cats stretched in the coolest 
; place they could find.  My day was about average.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, give or take a few.  
; Until then, take care, and it would be really simple to save the 
; earth.  All we would need to do would be bring about a world-
; wide depression.  As the economies ground to a halt, and the 
; factories shut down, imagine how much fuel we would save and how 
; much less carbon dioxide we would put into the atmosphere.  If 
; we actually cared about the environment as much as the media 
; implies, we should be willing to make a few small sacrifices. 
; And if we all do the right thing, global warming might actually 
; start to slow down in 100 years or so.
