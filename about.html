<body><h1>About <a href="index.html">Jim Muth's Fractal of the Day</a></h1>

<p>All of the images on these pages were created by Jim Muth.  The images
are shared by sending a message to the fractint user's mailing list,
although early images were posted to the now defunct fractal-art mailing
list.  As you can see from the dates in this archive, Jim has been posting
these parameter sets for over a decade.  Jim posts the parameter set for
generating the image as this is a small ASCII file that is easily shared.
The parameter sets provided here include Jim's original message as a
large comment block in the parameter set.</p>

<p>The images here are generated from those parameter set files by an
automated process using xfractint, the X Window System port of fractint.
The automated process extracts the parameter set from the email message
and runs xfractint to generate the image with a pixel size of 4800x3600.
This image is then filtered down to 1600x1200 to give a final antialiased
image with 3x oversampling.  Many of Jim's original images were computed
at pixel sizes of 640x480 or 800x600 and the computation times he
gives in his parameter sets reflect both the much smaller image sizes
he used originally and the computer he used to generate them.</p>

<p>You may notice that the dates encoded in the file name are
different from the dates in Jim's message shown in the parameter set.
The automated process uses the date from the email message header and
doesn't attempt to extract the date from Jim's message text.  Since
Jim usually posts Fractal of the Day the night before, the message
date tends to be one day earlier than the date given in the message
text.  Sometimes Jim anticipates that he won't be able to post the
Fractal of the Day for several days and posts those parameter sets in
advance.  This will show up as several images having the same date in
the filename.</p>

<p>Sometimes Jim will post a parameter set that includes parameters
for more than one image.  This might include two parameter sets that
seem to produce the same image with vastly different rendering times,
or it might be additional images that Jim has included to help you
visualize the structures he is discussing.  In these cases, the
filenames for these images will all have the same date and will differ
only by their parameter set names, but they will all share the same
parameter set file.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>I would like to thank Jim Muth for sharing his parameter sets and
commentary on the resulting images with us for over a decade.  Thanks,
Jim!</p>

<p>I would like to thank Pete Ashdown and XMission for providing me
with a machine dedicated to rendering these high resolution
images.</p>
