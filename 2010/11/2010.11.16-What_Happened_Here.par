; FOTD -- November 17, 2010 (Rating !!!)
; 
; NEW FORMULA ALERT!
; 
; UNUSUAL PICTURE SHAPE ALERT!
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image will begin calculating toward the center of the 
; screen.  This is no error.  Instead of a 4-3 width-height ratio, 
; today's image has a much wider 2-1 ratio.
; 
; Today's image rates a triple bang.  This means it is of excep-
; tional mathematical interest, though of only moderate artistic 
; value.  The formula is a new one, so be sure to enter it into 
; one of your formula files.
; 
; The new formula takes the basic Mandelbrot expression and simply 
; adds a variable function to both initial Z and C.  The effect of 
; the 'exp' (exponential) function that I applied to initial C in 
; today's image is to virtually place the observer inside the 
; plane of the image at the point assigned initial C, with the 
; nearby elements appearing larger and the more remote elements, 
; much smaller.
; 
; In today's image I stationed the observer at -1.40115518995 on 
; the X-axis, near the limit of the main body of the Mandelbrot 
; set.  The things this does to the set are dramatic, thus the 
; rating of !!!.  The question asked in the name "What Happened 
; Here" will be answered when the image is viewed.
; 
; In the actual M-set, the successive buds grow ever smaller as we 
; travel out the negative X-axis.  But by stationing the observer 
; at the limit of the string of buds, as I have done in the image, 
; I have negated this size decrease and made all the buds nearly 
; the same size.  The resulting image resembles nothing as much as 
; a centipede with 15+ segments.
; 
; Unfortunately, the image is a very slow one, growing ever slower 
; as it progresses and taking nearly an hour to finish.  I have 
; sent the finished image on ahead to Paul at the FOTD web site.  
; Hopefully, he will have it posted soon.

; 
; To set things straight about how I feel about global warming, 
; IMO, the earth is getting warmer because we're still coming out 
; of the most recent ice age.  And only a small percentage (one-
; percent or so) of this warming is due to man's activity.
; 
; Little or nothing can now be done to slow the natural warming, 
; so instead of futilely spending vast amounts to stop the warm-
; ing, we should be spending the money preparing for the minor 
; but inevitable sea-level rise of an inch or two in the coming 
; century, and at the same time developing renewable non-polluting 
; energy sources.
; 
; IMO, the most amusing part of the hyped-up global-warming 
; 'crisis' is watching the hated big corporations using it as a 
; sales pitch, and the easily manipulated masses buying 'green' 
; products, thinking they are helping to save the earth when they 
; are actually only enriching the hated big corporations
; 
; Heavy clouds, steady rain and a temperature of 52F 11C kept man 
; and cats alike indoors here at Fractal Central on Tuesday.  
; There was enough work to keep the man's mind off the outside con-
; ditions, but the fractal cats seemed fascinated by the dripping 
; rain and spent several hours on their window shelf, trying to 
; make sense of all the water.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and I see it's the cockroaches behind the conspiracy to 
; end the world.  That's a relief.  I thought it was the aliens 
; from the Herculean cluster.  (Actually, the roaches might do the 
; best job of running things.)
