; FOTD -- November 21, 2010 (Unrated)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is not my own.  It is one I found on the CD that 
; came with the second edition of the book "Fractal Creations".  
; Since the book was printed in 1993, the image is over 17 years 
; old.
; 
; On the CD, the image is in a directory named 'Sherry'.  I have 
; no idea who this mysterious 'Sherry' person might be.  I used 
; the image virtually as I found it on the disk, though I did make 
; it slightly smaller and add a few tints of color plus a few 
; brilliant highlights.
; 
; The image was calculated by the fn(z*z) formula hard-coded into 
; Fractint.
; 
; The name "By Sherry" indicates that I can take no credit for the 
; image, nor can I give it a rating.  I can only stand on the peak 
; of the mountain that someone else carried me to the top of, and 
; exclaim 'what a great view'.
; 
; The calculation time is incredibly fast -- less than one second 
; on my 2000mhz fractal-dedicated machine, which is very faithful, 
; but now and then decides it does not want to start up unless its 
; memory cards are reseated.
; 
; The finished image is also available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Too many clouds but otherwise benign conditions prevailed here 
; at Fractal Central on Saturday.  The temperature topped at a 
; quite average 48F +9C, which was mild enough to keep the fractal 
; cats happy.  When their happiness waned, they amused themselves 
; by chasing the toy laser beam up and down the hallway.  They 
; enjoy the laser so much that they come and ask one of us for 
; action when they want their exercise.
; 
; As for the humans, our day was average, which is the way we like 
; it.  The next FOTD, this time a J.M. original, will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and when we finally see the 
; light, what will we do with it?
