; FOTD -- November 26, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things were rather busy here at FC on Thursday, which was the 
; holiday on which we give thanks for something I'm not quite 
; sure of.  But despite the activity I found time to locate a 
; worthy fractal.
; 
; I took the parent fractal of three days ago and cut the portions 
; in half.  The effect was to do little more than double the size 
; of the parent.
; 
; Instead of lying in a valley at the southern edge of the 'fan' 
; of the parent, today's scene lies in a spiralling filament 
; extending from a twisted minibrot on the southeastern edge of 
; the fan.
; 
; The name "Spiral for the Ages" is admittedly overblown.  The 
; chief feature in the image is the minibrot, not a spiral. The 
; rating of a 7 is about what the scene is worth.  If I had more 
; time, I might have improved the colors and raised the rating a 
; half point or so.
; 
; The image calculates in just one minute -- in the super-fast 
; category.  No time will have been wasted if disappointment 
; prevails after the minute.  And the image is always available on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Thursday began with snow and sleet here at Fractal Central.  For 
; a while it looked like a white Thanksgiving was in store, but by 
; late morning it all changed to rain and within an hour the centi-
; meter or so of snow that had piled up was gone.  The fractal 
; cats kept careful watch on the big floppy flakes for an hour or 
; so, then decided to ask for food.  The temperature rose during 
; the day from 32F 0C at daybreak to 39F +4C at nightfall.
; 
; My day was pleasant enough.  FL kept the two guests who were 
; expected well supplied with food, while the foul weather kept 
; any unexpected visitors from dropping by.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and what will the 
; next media-manufactured crisis be?  It's already got me worried.
