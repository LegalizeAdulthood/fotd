; FOTD -- November 14, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is not exactly a slice of the Z^2+C Julibrot, but 
; it is certainly a slice of some other Julibrot, and at least in 
; my opinion, it is well worth being declared FOTD for November 14.
; 
; The rating of an 8 includes 2 full points for the coloring, 
; which creates most of the effect of the image.  But I cannot 
; take too much credit for the colors.  They were created by the 
; Fractint program with a random strike of the <enter> key.
; 
; The brilliant spot at the center of the image is a point of anti-
; bifurcation, or as I call such things, an anti-minibrot.
; 
; While naming the image I was undecided between "Light at the End 
; of the Tunnel" and "Glimmer of Hope".  I finally decided on the 
; latter name, since it was the one that fit in the allotted space 
; in the parameter file.
; 
; The image is a super fast one, finishing in a speedy 36 seconds. 
; The way to avoid the calculation might be to check the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; I say 'might be' because I have not heard from Paul for a week 
; or so, and the last I checked, the web site was not yet up to 
; date.  If for some reason, Paul is unable to continue with the 
; FOTD web site, I could probably take it over myself.  We are 
; also considering setting up our own web site here at FC.  Maybe 
; we could incorporate the FOTD web site into our own site.
; 
; After a chilly start, Saturday here at glorious Fractal Central 
; turned into another near-perfect day, with a temperature of 61F 
; 16C.  Only a few delicate streaks of cirrus marred the unbroken 
; blueness of the sky, while the strong sun in the southwest 
; window gave the fractal cats all the pleasure they needed while 
; the humans were away antiquing.
; 
; Our day was occupied by the antiquing trip to Richfield.  Maybe 
; I'm going soft, because these trips are actually starting to 
; become rather enjoyable.  The next FOTD will be posted in some-
; thing like 12 hours.  Until then, take care, and if the best has 
; not already happened, it is yet to come.
