; FOTD -- August 03, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we take another fractal trip to the crazy land of anti-
; bifurcation, which I have very recently discovered, (no, I was 
; not the first), and begun to explore.
; 
; Yesterday's FOTD was one of the best, yet to leave room for 
; possible better images, I could rate it no higher than a 9.5.  I 
; have now solved the dilemma.  When the ratings get above 9.5, I 
; will approach a rating of 10 asymptotically.  This way I can 
; always give ratings that are closer to 10, yet never run out of 
; room for a possible better image.  Today's image gives no rating 
; problem however.  Due to its excessively chaotic appearance, it 
; rates a humdrum 7.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is a Mandelbrot set.  The 
; scene is located in a chunk of debris inside a half-morphed 
; minibrot in an elephant trunk rather deep on the south shore 
; line of East Valley of the parent M-set.  Yesterday's far super-
; ior image had a similar location in a debris-filled minibrot 
; near the tip of the main spike of the parent M-set.  Clearly, I 
; must learn more about this anti-minibrot stuff.
; 
; I named the image "Enough is Enough" when I became annoyed with 
; all the unwanted detail that fills the image, most of which is a 
; horde of even smaller minibrots.
; 
; The calculation time of almost exactly 3 minutes will allow the 
; fractal visionary just enough time to prepare a drink that will 
; enhance the impact of the image.  For maximum impact, I suggest 
; a glass of raspberry iced-tea.
; 
; Those who do not consider tea their cup of tea may view the 
; finished image equally pleasurably on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where it may be enjoyed at leisure in finished form.
; 
; Monday here at Fractal Central brought a lot of nothing.  The 
; temperature of 84F 29C was normal, the partly cloudy skies were 
; normal, the moderate humidity was normal, a sprinkle of rain in 
; the morning was un-notable and mostly un-noticed.  The fractal 
; cats definitely took little notice of the outdoor conditions, 
; since they never get to go outdoors anyway.  They are usually 
; more interested in being fed than being outside cats.
; 
; My day was acceptable, which covers a lot of possibilities.  FL 
; was pleased when a neighbor asked her if she would be willing to 
; extend our garden to the neighbor's grounds.  FL is thinking 
; about it.  And I'm thinking about the next FOTD, which will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and I was walking 
; down Market Street the other day, when I found the asymptote the 
; man up the street had lost.  I returned it to its rightful owner.
