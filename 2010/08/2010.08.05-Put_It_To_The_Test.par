; FOTD -- August 06, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is perhaps more interesting 
; than the image itself.  It was created when I subtracted one 
; part of Z^(-4.99) from 5 parts of Z^(-1.99) and added (1/C) on 
; each iteration.  When rotated 180 degrees, it appears as a 
; Mandelbrot set gone wild.
; 
; Instead of a main bay, we have a circular area of chaos with a 
; cloverleaf pattern almost completely filling it.  And the large 
; bud on the X-axis has spread out into a secondary bay.  Beyond 
; this the main stem is well decorated with various kinds of 
; stuff, none of which I have yet checked, though I might do so 
; before the next FOTD.  Today's image is located in a moth-eaten 
; radical on the northern extremity of the western shore line of 
; the spread-out large bud.
; 
; To add a modicum of interest, I rendered today's image with the 
; 'outside' set to 'tdis', which, as in today's image, usually 
; creates a kind of terraced effect.  In today's image, the 
; improvement was not all that impressive however.
; 
; As for the image itself -- it rates a humble 6 -- nothing to get 
; excited about.  The name "Put It To The Test" means whatever the 
; viewer wishes.  The calculation time of 5 minutes is a bit slow 
; for an image that rates only a 6, but the wait may be avoided by 
; viewing the image in finished form on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; If Thursday had been a little cooler, and we had had more rain 
; on Wednesday, Thursday would have been a near ideal day here at 
; Fractal Central.  As it was, the high temperature of 90F 32C 
; kept the fractal cats close to the cool spots, while the soil in 
; FL's garden remains quite dry and dusty.
; 
; My day was average.  The next FOTD, for better or worse, will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and when one has 
; nothing to day, he should say nothing.
