; 
; FOTD -- August 28, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the East Valley of a Mandeloid that 
; on the surface is mostly quadratic, but in its depths begins to 
; take on exponent-2.5 tendencies.
; 
; The central minibrot in today's image has very obvious 2.5 
; tendencies.  Curiously enough, this minibrot is shaped nothing 
; like its parent fractal, which resembles a Mandelbrot set with 
; its main bud squeezed half shut.
; 
; The rating of an 8 includes a full point for my coloring effort. 
; I tried for a half-hour to make the 8-bit color look like 
; 24-bit, with only mild success.  I managed to get the iteration 
; bands subtle enough to be overlooked by those who don't know 
; what the bands are.  But in the end I had to face reality -- The 
; bands are still visible.
; 
; The name "Only Halfway There" could refer to the 2.5 exponent in 
; the generating expression.  Or it could indicate that I was only 
; half successful in eliminating the iteration bands.
; 
; The calculation time of just over 2 minutes will pass in 2.5 
; flashes.  Or the image may be viewed at leisure on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Perfect conditions prevailed here at Fractal Central on Friday, 
; with total sun and a temperature of 79F 26C.  The few small 
; puffy clouds merely added to the perfection.  Both fractal cats 
; were more interested in finding the cricket that eluded them 
; yesterday than the outside weather.  FL and I think the cricket 
; scurried under the refrigerator, where most likely it will stay, 
; chirping now and then.
; 
; Otherwise, my day was good enough.  The next FOTD will be posted 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if someone believes 
; something metaphysical and someone else does not, how do we 
; determine who is right?
