; FOTD -- August 29, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is another pretty good one.  The rating of a much-
; above-average 8 is fully justified, though a full point of the 
; rating is earned by the coloring.
; 
; The name "The Hidden Jewel" refers to the scene in general.
; 
; The calculation time of 1 minute is very near FOTD average.
; 
; On its surface, the parent fractal is a normal Mandelbrot set, 
; but in its depths things start to go awry.  Today's image is 
; located near the edge of the main negative spike, at the very 
; un-exceptional point of -1.71.  At this point the single spike 
; has fractured into an infinity of fractal spikes, which somewhat 
; resemble the train-tracks in the Enola rail yards, located about 
; 75 miles or 120km south of FC.
; 
; The image may be viewed in its full glory by running the para-
; meter file included below.  An easier way to view the image is 
; to go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; and enjoy it in its fully finished splendor there, without the 
; need of calculation.
; 
; Absolutely perfect weather continued here at Fractal Central on 
; Saturday.  Not the slightest trace of cloud marred the blue sky, 
; while the temperature settled at a near-perfect 82F 28C.  The 
; fractal cats gave up on the cricket and spent the day watching 
; for stray cats intruding in their yard.  (They seem to think 
; it's their yard, even though we never let them go out there.)
; 
; My day was uneventful, while FL busied herself in the gardens.  
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and I wonder if they have fractals and internet in the hot 
; place down below (AKA hell).  If not, then I don't want to go 
; there for a single day, much less for all eternity.
