; FOTD -- August 16, 2010 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in a perturbed Mandelbrot set, and it 
; is also a scene in some distant galaxy.  But is it a real scene 
; that actually exists somewhere?  This depends on whether the 
; universe (or multiverse) is finite or infinite.  If the universe 
; is limited, then the scene possibly might exist somewhere, some-
; what as it appears in the image, though more likely the image is 
; purely imaginary.  If the universe is infinite however, then the 
; scene actually exists somewhere out there.  In fact, it exists 
; in an infinity of different locations.  Since I assume the uni-
; verse is infinite, I claim that today's image is, in effect, an 
; actual photograph of one of those infinity of identical scenes.
; 
; Metaphysical philosophizing aside, the star field outlining the 
; bud in today's image is all a matter of coloring.  Therefore, I 
; must humbly give myself most of the credit for the 9-1/2 rating 
; of the image.  To see what coloring can do, try changing the 
; color palette and then see what you think the image is worth.
; 
; The name "Stellar Nursery" implies that there is more truth in 
; the image than meets the eye.  The calculation time of under 
; 1-1/4 minutes can hardly be beat.  The only thing that stands a 
; chance is the trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; to view the finished image there.
; 
; Heavy clouds and intermittent rain made things rather unpleasant 
; here at Fractal Central on Sunday.  The temperature of 75F 24C 
; was fair enough, though the rain made it hard to enjoy.  As of 
; 8pm, just over one inch or about 3cm of rain had fallen into 
; FL's garden rain gauge.  The fractal cats had their big thrill 
; when they started chasing a wasp that got into the kitchen.  
; Luckily, I removed the bug before anyone got stung.  The rest of 
; the day was totally routine.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, or maybe don't take care.  Life can be pretty boring for 
; those who are always taking too much care.
