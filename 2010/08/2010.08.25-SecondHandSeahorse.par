; FOTD -- August 26, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is another venture into Seahorse Valley, but today 
; we are not in *THE* Seahorse Valley, we are in Seahorse Valley 
; of the large minibrot on the west branch of the filament extend-
; ing from the large period-3 bud on the north shore of the main 
; bay of the Mandelbrot set.  In recognition of this fact, I named 
; the image "Second-Hand Seahorse".
; 
; Largely due to my coloring finesse, the image rates an 8.  (Only 
; my humility prevents me from actually telling how great a color-
; ist I am!)  As is the case with all conventional-math Mandelbrot 
; images that run on the P4-2000mhz machine, today's image is fire-
; ball fast.  At SF5 resolution it finishes in merely 9 seconds.
; 
; Those who prefer to avoid the risk associated with fireballs may 
; view the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Except for a few too many clouds, Wednesday was really a rather 
; pleasant day here at Fractal Central.  The high temperature of 
; 77F 25C fell right in the middle of the comfort range, while the 
; reasonable humidity added to the comfort.  The fractal cats were 
; more interestred in the new crop of neighborhood kittens, who 
; are just starting to explore the world, than they were with the 
; outside conditions.
; 
; My day was about average for the end of August.  At breakfast FL 
; got a little concerned about the latest poison-egg scare, but I 
; assured her that as long as we eat our eggs scrambled, we will 
; survive.
; 
; And one thing absolutely certain is that the Mandelbrot set will 
; survive far longer than anyone or anything now alive on earth or 
; on any other planet.  As for the next FOTD, it will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and where does dark energy 
; come from?  (Most likely it's simply negative energy!)
