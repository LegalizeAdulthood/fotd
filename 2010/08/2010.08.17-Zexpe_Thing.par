; 
; FOTD -- August 18, 2010 (Rating 7?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the 'Zexpe' fractal, the Mandeloid 
; created by the formula Z^(epsilon)+C.  I think the fractal was 
; given its name by Lee Skinner, who did quite a lot of work with 
; this fractal a number of years ago.
; 
; The Zexpe fractal rather resembles the cubic Mandelbrot set, 
; though the two main buds are shifted well around toward the 
; negative X-axis.  The most interesting part of the Zexpe fractal 
; however lies at the western edge of the main bay, near the 
; X-axis, where all kinds of chaotic things happen.
; 
; Today's image lies in a phantom valley in a larger minibrot in 
; this chaotic area of the parent Zexpe fractal.  It is is a good 
; example of some of the strangeness found there.
; 
; I named the image "Zexpe Thing", which is what it is.  I rated 
; it at a 7?, which is what I think it's worth.  The question mark 
; implies that the image might not be entirely of my own creation. 
; 
; The calculation time of 5 minutes is a small price to pay for an 
; enjoyable image.  And those pressed for time may always view the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today's image may owe more to Lee than meets the eye.  The image 
; is a zoom into an old image, which I found on a floppy disk that 
; had been stored away for over 10 years.  I might have taken that 
; old image from the CD of fractals that came with the second 
; edition of "Fractal Creations".  I long ago misplaced that disk.
; 
; Lee produced many Zexpe images for that CD, and the old image 
; that I found on the floppy disk was created by a formula named 
; 'Zexpe', which I do not have in my files.  (I had to make a para-
; meter file of the original image and edit it so that it would 
; work with the manzpower formula.)  The colors are of my own 
; invention however.
; 
; Now on to what you have all been waiting for -- the weather!
; 
; Actually, some very pleasant weather prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central on Tuesday, with an azure blue sky decorated with angel-
; hair cirrus and cottonpuff cumulus clouds, lower humidity, and a 
; temperature of 84F 29C.
; 
; Nicholas, the oversized all-black gentleman fractal cat, enjoyed 
; the conditions from the top of the secretary, while Cassie, the 
; petite gray lady fractal cat, chose the top of the side-by-side, 
; next to Nicholas.  I found my enjoyment in the workroom, where 
; the day's work went unexpectedly smoothly.
; 
; If all continues going well, the next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  If not, then look for it anyway.  Until then, take care, 
; and when the world ends, will fractals still exist?
