; FOTD -- August 19, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Almost Quadratic".  The reason is that 
; the exponent of Z is 2.01, which is almost quadratic.  The 
; parent fractal is a Mandelbrot set, no surprise there, but this 
; set is rotated 180 degrees, so that East Valley is on the west 
; side of the main bay and the main spike points east.
; 
; Both East Valley and the main spike have split into fractalized 
; pieces, with the greatest distortion on the southern branch of 
; Seahorse Valley and the southern shore of the large period-2 
; bud.  But the Seahorse Valley distortion is an FOTD for another 
; day.  Today we are concerned with the things happening to East 
; Valley, which has broadened into a wedge.  Today's image lies in 
; a curious patch of debris near the northern edge of this wedge.
; 
; All this strangeness might appear good in writing, but on the 
; screen, even when helped by the 'tdis' outside option, it makes 
; an image that I can rate no higher than a 6.
; 
; The calculation time is a borderline slow 5-1/2 minutes.  The 
; best way to avoid the wait is to rush carefully to the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; and view the finished image there.
; 
; Lots of clouds, a little sun and a temperature of 82F 28C made 
; Wednesday a rather pleasant but uneventful day here at Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cats were not concerned with the outside 
; weather however.  Nicholas somehow worked open one of the high 
; unused cabinets in the kitchen and disappeared inside for a 
; couple hours during the afternoon.  Cassie checked the space but 
; decided not to go in.
; 
; In my department, things were about average.  The next FOTD will 
; be posted in 24 hours, and that certainly is average.  Until 
; then, take care, and if all electrons are exactly the same, how 
; can we distinguish one from another?
