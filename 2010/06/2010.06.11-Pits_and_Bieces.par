; FOTD -- June 12, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Pits and Bieces", which is a play on 
; the words 'bits and pieces'.  The reason for the name will be 
; obvious as soon as the image is seen, and with a calculation 
; time of 1-1/4 minutes, the wait will not be long.
; 
; The parent fractal is a degenerate Mandelbrot set.  Today's 
; scene is located some distance east of the remains of the East 
; Valley of the parent.  Little East Valley stuff remains in the 
; image, though a few hints appear here and there.
; 
; Surprisingly, the image is extremely sensitive to changes in the 
; escape radius, imag(p3), which in the image is the formula 
; default of 100.  As the escape radius is increased or decreased, 
; the image changes dramatically.  It evaporates and vanishes 
; entirely when the value of imag(p3) is increased to about 8500.  
; When imag(p3) is set to -13.92, the image takes the shape of a 
; Maltese cross.  Any negative value greater than this gives a 
; blank screen.
; 
; Before experimenting with the escape radius however, be warned 
; that the calculation time increases dramatically as the ER is 
; increased.  When imag(p3) is set to substantially greater 
; values, the calculation time increases to more than 15 minutes.
; 
; At an escape radius of over 8500 or so, the result is a blank 
; screen consisting totally of 'inside' stuff.  But even here all 
; hope is not lost.  Using an active inside fill such as 'bof61' 
; brings the blank screen to life.  But here again, the calcula-
; tion time grows even longer.
; 
; The rating of a 7 seems about right.  Calculation may be avoided 
; entirely by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Near perfect outside conditions kept the fractal cats happy here 
; at Fractal Central on Friday, even though they are inside cats.  
; Partly cloudy skies, low humidity and a temperature of 79F 26C 
; are near perfect by any human's or any cat's standards.  In my 
; area, the rush died out in the morning, followed by a slow 
; afternoon.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and don't be caught with your fractals down.
