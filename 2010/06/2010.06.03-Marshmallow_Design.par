; FOTD -- June 04, 2010 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image could almost be a photograph of a 3-D scene.  
; Actually, there is nothing 3-D at all about it.  It is totally 
; 2-D, a flat scene in a fragmented elephant in the rudimentary 
; East Valley of the parent fractal that results when the expres-
; sion Z^(1.5)+C is iterated 12 levels up the logarithmic ladder 
; with the 'round' function applied.
; 
; The 3-D effect is a combination of the coloring and the basic 
; underlying iteration bands.  But it is an illusion.  The wrong 
; colors will totally destroy the 3-D effect.
; 
; Actually, the visual 3-D view we have of the so-called outer 
; 'real' world is also an illusion.  The images on our retinas are 
; totally 2-D.  The third dimension appears in our awareness when 
; our mind (or brain if you're a materialist) compares and com-
; bines the two slightly different images sent to it by our two 
; eyes.
; 
; Does this mean that the 3-D solidity of the outer world is also 
; an illusion?  I often wonder.  True, the outer world obeys the 
; mathematical laws of 3-D space, but we ourselves invented mathe-
; matics and tweaked its rules so that it works correctly when we 
; apply it to the world we assume exists around us.
; 
; We can prove that the universe is three-dimensional by observing 
; the orbits of the planets.  It can be demonstrated mathemati-
; cally that stable planetary orbits are possible only in spaces 
; of two or three dimensions.  Of course, if we lived in a world 
; of four spatial dimensions, we would have developed a math that 
; demonstrates that stable orbits are possible also in spaces of 
; four dimensions.
; 
; Now back to the image.
; 
; I named today's image "Marshmallow Design".  I must have had a 
; fleeting impression of roasting marshmallows while trying to 
; think of a name.  The rating of a 9.5 is exceptionally high, and 
; includes a generous self-reward for the coloring, but I think 
; the image is worth it.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-2/3 minutes will be no problem for 
; those who cook their own fractals.  Those who prefer their 
; fractals pre-cooked and canned may view the finished image on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Typical summer weather made Thursday a typical partly cloudy 
; summer day here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats thought 
; the temperature of 88F 31C was a bit warm, but with the cool 
; tile floor to stretch out on, they did not complain too much.  
; My day was about average.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and the greedy big-oil guys are getting worried.  So keep 
; pumping and reassure them that we still depend on them.
