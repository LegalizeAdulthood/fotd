; FOTD -- June 23, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; On its outer edges, today's image is a Julia set of Seahorse 
; Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  But it is not a Julia set; it is 
; a Mandelbrot set.  And it is hardly quadratic.  Those circular 
; objects in the center have 32 lobes, which makes them of 
; order-33.
; 
; So I leave it to the viewer to decide what to call the image.  
; As for me, I took it for what it is, rated it at a 6 and named 
; it "Gear World".  I had a quick impression of a gear train as I 
; searched for a name.
; 
; The calculation time of 6-1/2 minutes is not the briefest ever, 
; but it is not the longest either.  To see what all the excite-
; ment is about, run the included parameter file or hurry to the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; and enjoy the finished image there.
; 
; I wisely avoided another meaningless discussion at lunch time on 
; Tuesday, when FL asked me if I think the end of the world is 
; coming.  "Of course it's coming," I told her.  The only ques-
; tions are when it's coming and what will cause it.  I did not 
; tell her that I believe our current obsession with technology is 
; pathological, and is probably the beginning of the end.  Now for 
; some news that is more immediate.
; 
; Lots of clouds prevailed all morning here at Fractal Central on 
; Tuesday.  At noontime a short but heavy shower fell, followed by 
; heavy clouds most of the afternoon.  The sky cleared around 5pm, 
; but the air was so hazy that the clearing was almost invisible.  
; The high humidity and temperature of 84F 29C merely added to the 
; unpleasantness.  The fractal cats spent the day doing what cats 
; do best.  They slept.  Cassie chose the foot stool, while Nico 
; stretched on the cool floor.
; 
; My day was about as peaceful as days ever get.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours, give or take a few.  Until then, 
; take care, and what will we do when the world ends?
