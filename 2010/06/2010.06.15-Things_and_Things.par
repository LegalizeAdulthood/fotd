; FOTD -- June 16, 2010 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After seeing what AOL did to the 2 FOTD's that I tried to send 
; in text format, I have decided to forget that has-been and over-
; priced ISP, and stick with Earthlink (aka Mindspring).  I am 
; currently having problems getting the Earthlink software, which 
; I downloaded, to run properly on the new machine, but if I have 
; no luck in a day or so, I'll forget the software and access 
; Earthlink directly through the built-in networking ability of 
; Windows XP.  I might do this anyway.  I think I would appreciate 
; not seeing all the advertising.
; 
; As for today's image, it's a quick one, though no bargain.  Not 
; wanting to embarrass myself, I declined to give it a rating.  
; The name "Things and Things" is the best I could think of.  I 
; might also have intended a comment about the names of several 
; unbearably trendy 'country gift' shops in town.
; 
; When I first saw today's image, I saw only a sea of featureless 
; chaos.  But a bit of color tweaking brought out vague shapes in 
; the chaos.  Today's subtle, pastel-tinted image shows every bit 
; of stuff the image has in it.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes is brief enough so that 
; nothing will have been wasted if the image disappoints.  And 
; even this brief calculation time may be avoided by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Near-normal mid-June weather was the rule here at Fractal 
; Central on Tuesday.  Normal conditions mean partly-cloudy skies 
; with a temperature of 82F 28C, which is exactly what we had.  
; The fractal cats were also near normal, which means they spent 
; most of the day stretched out on the kitchen floor.
; 
; With the computer situation coming under control, but not yet 
; quite there, my day was a bit hectic, but another day or so 
; should see peace once more prevailing.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and walk on the 
; trendy side.
