; FOTD -- June 05, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is little more than a pleasing pattern.  It has no 
; minibrot at the center, though smaller quintic minibrots are 
; scattered all through it.  The name "Pleasant Patterns" refers 
; to the general area of the parent fractal.
; 
; On the surface, this parent fractal appears to be a Mandelbrot 
; set, but the deeper one goes into it, the more it takes on 
; quintic characteristics.  The location of today's scene is in a 
; small filament extending from the northeast shore line of the 
; main bay of the large minibrot on the main spike of the parent.
; 
; The image consists of a combination of hills and valleys.  The 
; most prominent hill lies in the center and is colored bluish-
; red, while the deepest valley surrounds the quintic minibrot in 
; the upper left part of the frame.
; 
; The rating of an 8 might be a bit liberal for an image with no 
; well-defined quadratic minibrot at the center, but the combina-
; tion of hills and valleys adds just enough interest to justify 
; the rating.
; 
; The calculation time of a very brief 34 seconds means that very 
; little time will have been wasted if the image fails to please.  
; Viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; makes the viewing process even more efficient.
; 
; At lunch on Friday, as images of dead oil-covered birds flashed 
; on the TV screen, FL scolded me for showing too little concern 
; about the environmental damage being done in the Gulf as a 
; result of the continuing oil leak.  She said I should be very 
; angry at the responsible oil company.  To avoid a luncheon 
; squabble, I voiced no opinion, but such naive, feel-good short-
; sightedness kind of annoys me.
; 
; Of course I'm concerned, but let's face it.  *WE* are the real 
; problem.  We are the ones addicted to petroleum.  We heat our 
; homes with oil; we buy almost everything in plastic bottles; we 
; absolutely need our cars if we want to do anything but sit in 
; our front yards.  Until we end our addiction, I suggest we fill 
; our tanks in silence and stop pretending to care about the 
; environment.
; 
; I'll now have nothing more to say on this admittedly political 
; topic.  Fractals and weather are far more fun and sometimes far 
; less frustrating.
; 
; Midsummer conditions prevailed again on Friday here at Fractal 
; Central, with oppressive humidity, hazy partly cloudy skies, 
; thunder-storms on the horizon, and a temperature of 90F 32C.  
; The fractal cats spent most of the day on the cool floor in the 
; kitchen, hoping for an unexpected spill of cream, which never 
; happened.  My day was fair enough, and if everything goes well, 
; tomorrow will be a repeat.
; 
; The next FOTD fractal will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and continue the endless search for the perfect 
; fractal.
