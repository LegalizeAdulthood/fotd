; FOTD -- June 09, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's formula, the FinDivBrot-2, certainly creates some 
; interesting and unexpected parent fractals -- and it's only 4 
; lines long.  (I have always avoided those overblown formulas 
; with 40 or 50 lines, most of which are devoted to coloring 
; tricks.  I much prefer the coloring tricks to come from the 
; fractal math, not the fractal artist.)
; 
; Today's formula, along with the type=Mandel, MandAutoCritInZ, 
; MandelbrotBC3, and SliceJulibrot4 formulas (formulae) are the 
; ones I turn to almost automatically when I boot the Fractint
; program.  They rarely disappoint me.
; 
; In today's FOTD, the FinDivBrot-2 formula produced a parent 
; fractal that resembles a Mandelbrot set pretty closely until its 
; main stem is examined.  Instead of one main stem, this parent 
; has two main stems, both of them infinitely divided into ever-
; smaller curled stems.  Today's image is located in the East 
; Valley area of the minibrot on the northern main stem.
; 
; I named the image "Beyond the Horizon" because I did go a bit 
; beyond the limit of perfect definition to find the scene.  The 
; rating of a 7 means the image is kind of good, but nothing to 
; get excited about.
; 
; The calculation time of just under 4 minutes may be avoided by 
; viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Another picture perfect day prevailed here at Fractal Central 
; on Tuesday, an exact repeat of Monday.  The fractal cats, now 
; convinced that the unwanted intruder cat has moved on, spent 
; most of the day sleeping.  My day was busier than Monday, but 
; still left lots of time for fractal diversions.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and pass 
; the time pleasantly.
; 
; P.S.  If a Klein bottle is given an extra twist, the result is 
; a surface known as a 'projective plane', which needs a full five 
; dimensions to be seen in its full unsquashed, non-intersecting 
; glory.  But don't ask me to describe the shape of this surface.  
; Describing the Klein bottle is hard enough.  And unless I'm 
; mistaken, a projective plane may also be created by widening 
; a Mobius strip until the single edge closes on itself to form a 
; single-sided edgeless surface.
