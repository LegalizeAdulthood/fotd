; FOTD -- June 02, 2010 (Rating X)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is an expedition into the Mandelbrot set.  The 
; trip takes us to a depth of over 10^17, which is not all that 
; deep as images go, but still deep enough to require the much 
; slower arbitrary-precision math routine.
; 
; The tiny minibrot in the image is located in the Seahorse Valley 
; of a much larger but still tiny minibrot on a filament extending 
; northwest from the second bud out the main stem of the largest 
; minibrot on the main stem of the parent Mandelbrot set.
; 
; And with all this said, it's time to enjoy the image.  In my 
; opinion, the most striking features of the image are the brill-
; iant green area inside the ring of chaos and the 'resetting' of 
; the count of elements as we approach the minibrot.  This reset-
; ting to a lesser power of 2 indicates that the minibrot at the 
; center lies in the attraction basin of a larger minibrot, and is 
; not directly attracted to the M-set itself.
; 
; The rating of an X is not a rating of a roman-numeral ten.  It 
; means I had a hard time deciding how to rate just another not-so-
; deep, deep view into the M-set.
; 
; The name "Mandelbrot Picnic" expresses the fun of looking into 
; the Mandelbrot set even after more than 30 years beyond its dis-
; covery.  With an infinity to explore, there is, and always will 
; be, something new to be found.
; 
; The calculation time of today's image is not very much fun 
; however.  Requiring the slower arbitrary math, the image takes 
; over 19 minutes on the 2000mhz machine.  Those who do not 
; appreciate delayed gratification can enjoy the instant variety 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; While we were watching the news at lunch on Tuesday, FL made a 
; comment about the 'evil' big-oil companies.  I said nothing at 
; the time, but I did leave a little comment at the end of this 
; discussion.
; 
; Lots of clouds and humidity, with a temperature of 84F 29C and 
; showers of rain, made Tuesday a rather unpleasant day here at 
; Fractal Central.  The fractal cats checked the outside condi-
; tions several times before deciding to settle on the kitchen 
; floor, where they not only could keep cool, but were within an 
; easy leap if they heard a can being opened.  My day was average; 
; tomorrow will be near the same.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and if we are so ready to condemn the greedy big oil 
; companies, why do we continue to feed their greed by consuming 
; their products?  In my opinion, our resentment of 'big oil' is 
; a sham.  What we really resent is the way we have let the pet-
; roleum conglomerates become our overlords, and in so doing, 
; have become their dependent and obedient serfs.
