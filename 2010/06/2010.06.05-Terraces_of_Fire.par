; FOTD -- June 06, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "Terraces of Fire".  One look at its fiery 
; terraces will give the reason.  The parent fractal is hardly 
; more than a rudimentary blob with a single sizeable bay and the 
; remnants of an East Valley.  Slices of long-gone elephants 
; abound in this valley, with today's scene located not too deep 
; in one of the remaining left-over elephant-trunk spirals.
; 
; The terraced effect is a result of rendering the image with the 
; outside set to 'tdis'.  Making terraces is one of the things 
; this option does quite well.  The rating of an 8 is mostly due 
; to this terraced effect, which is really all the image has going 
; for it.
; 
; The calculation time of 13 minutes is admittedly slow, but it is 
; not excessive when the resulting image rates an 8.  The thirteen 
; minutes may be saved by surfing to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where the already-calculated image is posted for instant relief 
; of impatience.
; 
; The warm and humid conditions continued here at Fractal Central 
; on Saturday.  The temperature of 88F 31C was made worse by the 
; air that was almost moist enough to swim in.  The fractal cats, 
; who do not swim, kept cool on the kitchen floor.  In my depart-
; ment, all was quiet.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and how many liters of water will a Klein 
; bottle 30cm in diameter hold?
