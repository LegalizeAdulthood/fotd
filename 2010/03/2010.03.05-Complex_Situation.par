; FOTD -- March 06, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In yesterday's FOTD we added 0.001i to the real 2.003 exponent 
; of Z.   Today we raise the stakes and add 0.5i.  The parent 
; fractal is quite twisted, but East Valley is still discernible, 
; where the elephants still romp.  Today's image is located in a 
; trunk of one of the elephants, though perhaps a woolly mammoth 
; would be a better description of the fractal pachyderm.
; 
; The image shows quite clearly what happens when a complex power 
; of Z with an increasingly large imaginary part is iterated.  The 
; features break up until ultimately all order is lost.  Today's 
; image was captured before the breakup progressed too far.  The 
; typical East-Valley-spiral features are still there, though they 
; are totally disorganized, and all trace of the 2,4,8... series 
; is gone.  (It is hard to have an imaginary number of elements 
; around a minibrot.)  The image is still rather interesting how-
; ever, and I decided to rate it at a 7.
; 
; The name "Complex Situation" describes the scene, which will 
; grow ever more disorganized if the imaginary part of Z is 
; increased.  The brief calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes will 
; cause no impatience.
; 
; A simpler way to view the image is to view it on the new FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; or on the old site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The old site will soon be taken down however.
; 
; Near total sunshine and a temperature of 48F +9C here at Fractal 
; Central on Friday gave the local fractal cats a pleasant after-
; noon on their sunny shelf.  My day began busy in the morning but 
; turned peaceful in the afternoon once the real (compared to 
; fractal) work was out of the way.  FL took the afternoon off to 
; watch the continuing earthquake (terremoto) and tsunami coverage 
; from Chile, which FL says is celebrating its 200th anniversary 
; this year.
; 
; The next FOTD is scheduled to be posted in 24 hours.  But don't 
; be disappointed if it fails to appear on schedule.  You know how 
; prone we are to sudden antiquing trips on Saturdays here at FC.  
; Until whenever, take care, and if the unfortunate people of this 
; world will have it better in heaven to make up for their earthly 
; suffering, does this mean that the fortunate will have it less 
; good in heaven simply because they suffered less during this 
; life?
