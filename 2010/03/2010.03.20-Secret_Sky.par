; FOTD -- March 20, 2010 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD is not only late, it is not even a new one.  The 
; image has already appeared once as a FOTD under the name 
; "Skyscape".  Well, today it appears under the name "Secret Sky".
; 
; The lateness happened because FL and I went back to Old Fractal 
; Central on Friday, where we and my sister had a little ceremony 
; as we laid to rest Thomas, the 20-year-old last remaining 
; original fractal cat.  His worn-out body now lies peacefully in 
; the holly patch, where he and his brother Tippy spent so many 
; years together, lurking and watching for trouble.
; 
; As for the fractal, it has a kind of heavenly feeling to it, 
; which I guess is appropriate.
; 
; Since the image is a repeat, I gave it no rating.  The calcula-
; tion time of 2 minutes should cause little impatience.
; 
; The image is also available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The conditions were perfect back at Old Fractal Central on 
; Friday, with full sun and a temperature of 75F 24C.  The new 
; fractal cats were happy when we returned, so I assume conditions 
; were equally perfect up here.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in around 12 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and be a fractal genius.
