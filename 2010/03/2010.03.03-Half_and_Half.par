; FOTD -- March 04, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; If the Julia set of a Z^(2.003)+C Mandelbrot rectangle is an 
; octagon, what would we see if we checked half-way between the 
; Julia orientation and one of the other orientations -- a 
; hexagon?  Actually, when the octagon is double-rotated halfway 
; toward the Mandelbrot direction, it has long since become a 
; perfect rectangle.  In fact, it morphs into a rectangle well 
; before the double rotation reaches one degree from the Julia 
; plane.
; 
; Today's image shows how our Julia octagon appears when its 
; orientation is rotated only 0.000065 degree toward the 
; Rectangular direction.  It certainly does not appear as an 
; octagon, though the eight vertices are still vaguely 
; discernible, and it is nowhere near appearing as a rectangle.  
; In fact, it is hard to believe that the weird shape will ever 
; morph into a rectangle.  But strangeness is a way of life in the 
; world of fractals, and with quite a bit of stretching and a bit 
; of skewing, the pointed shape in the center of today's image 
; will be a near-perfect rectangle by the time it is rotated to 
; the Oblate direction.
; 
; The name "Half-and-Half" does not refer to coffee creamer.  It 
; means that the shape in the image is halfway between its Julia 
; shape and the Oblate shape.  The rating of a 7 is above average, 
; which makes the image's calculation time of just under 2 minutes 
; reasonable enough.
; 
; The most reasonable way to view the finished image however is to 
; view it on the FOTD web site, which for another 10 days or so 
; may be accessed at both the following addresses:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; or
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Wednesday began with light snow here at Fractal Central.  The 
; snow ended by midday, leading to a cloudy afternoon with 
; occasional sprinkles of rain and a temperature of a seasonable 
; 43F +6C.  The fractal cats would have preferred more sun, but a 
; special treat of salmon (we were out of tuna) eased their 
; disappointment.  My day was normal.  FL is still watching the 
; continuing 24-hour earthquake coverage on TV-Chile.  (It looks 
; riveting; it's too bad I don't understand Spanish.)
; 
; If all goes well, and why should it not, the next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if one wants 
; nothing, he is certain to get everything he desires.
