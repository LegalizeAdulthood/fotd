; FOTD -- March 13, 2010 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image holds not only the promised surprise but a mystery 
; as well.  I named it "Misplaced Surprise" because the minibrot 
; in the upper right seems strangely out of place.
; 
; Yesterday's image is an East-Valley-type Julia set.  This is 
; evident by its appearance.  Today's image shows the same scene 
; from a viewpoint double-rotated only 0.001,0.001 degree from the 
; Julia direction.  (Double rotation is another story.)  Despite 
; such a tiny rotation, the resulting image has lost all resem-
; blance to a Julia set, and more closely resembles a non-critical 
; Mandelbrot scene.  But wait!  This is impossible!  What is a 
; near-perfect Mandelbrot minibrot doing in a fractal that is so 
; close to being a Julia set?
; 
; Actually, the minibrot is far from perfect.  A closer examina-
; tion will reveal that it is perturbed, but the fact that it is 
; there at all makes the image so exceptional.
; 
; When I began rotating the scene toward the Mandelbrot orienta-
; tion, I had one of the biggest surprises of my fractal career.  
; A near-perfect Mandelbrot midget unexpectedly appeared amidst 
; the degenerating Julia features.  This is striking because, due 
; to the four-dimensional shape of Mandelbrot elements in the 
; Julibrot, with 2 infinitely extended dimensions and 2 compact 
; dimensions, Mandelbrot features supposedly cannot appear in a 
; Julia set.
; 
; Another thing I notice in the image is the missing elements.  In 
; the pure Julia version, 32 striped red elements surround the cen-
; ter.  In today's almost-Julia version I see only 24.  I have no 
; idea what happened to the missing elements, though I suspect a 
; second radiant center lies off the screen some distance to the 
; left.
; 
; I have no answers to these fractal paradoxes, nor do I expect to 
; think of any.  I guess it will forever remain one of those unex-
; pected things that make fractals so interesting.
; 
; Since the image is of purely mathematical interest, and would 
; have little artistic worth to the 'look ma I'm an artist' type 
; of fractalist, I rated it at a question mark.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-2/3 minutes for all this surprise and 
; mystery is quite a bargain.  Those who are not bargain hunters 
; may view the image on the new FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The weather here at Fractal Central took a turn for the worse 
; Thursday night, and Friday dawned with cloudy skies and light 
; rain.  Friday brought continued clouds, intermittent rain and a 
; temperature of 50F 10C.  These conditions did not please the 
; fractal cats, who wanted more sun.  Unfortunately, with rain 
; forecast for at least 3 more days, the cats will remain unhappy.
; 
; My day was fair enough.  If all goes well and no antiquing 
; expedition arises on Saturday, the next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be with the fractal elite.
; 
; P.S. My almost-useless AOL e-mail address may be discontinued in 
; a month or so.
