; FOTD -- October 20, 2010 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates only a 5, but this is for its artistic 
; aspect, which I admit is not too great.  It's mathematical 
; aspect is far more interesting however.
; 
; While casually rotating the colors of today's scene, and ready 
; to move on to a more promising image, I caught a fleeting 
; glimpse of an unsuspected pattern buried in the chaos that fills 
; the screen.  I bit of tweaking revealed that I was not mistaken. 
; The pattern definitely is there -- unlike anything I have seen 
; before.  But it takes special coloring to reveal the underground 
; pattern, which is nearly invisible with normal random coloring.
; 
; The parent fractal consists of a circle with a trapezoidal shape 
; nearly filling it and a large distorted Mandeloid inside the 
; trapezoid.  Most of the distortion in the Mandeloid lies in the 
; higher-order buds, which are elongated to ridiculous lengths.  
; Today's scene lies in the northern branch of Seahorse Valley of 
; the Mandeloid.
; 
; The image is filled with both minibrots and disappointing dry 
; valleys that look like they hold minibrots but go flat before a 
; minibrot appears.  I have already checked a few minibrots and 
; found them to be disappointing.  This does not mean that no 
; great minibrots lie in the depths, but it is not a good way to 
; start searching.
; 
; The name "Patterns in the Mist" refers back to the original 
; scene before I began work on the colors, when the dark under-
; ground pattern was virtually invisible.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes will pass in a flash, 
; especially for those who have something else to do while 
; waiting.  Those with idle time may avoid impatience by viewing 
; the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Tuesday turned out really not too bad here at Fractal Central.  
; The morning fog cleared off by 10am, leading to a sunny day with 
; light winds and a temperature of 63F 17C.  For some reason, the 
; fractal cats were active unusually early, and settled into their 
; afternoon naps well before noon.  My day was rather busy but 
; satisfying.  FL was also busy.  The next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and the supernatural does not 
; exist, that is unless we are talking about what the human brain 
; is supposed to do.
