; 
; FOTD -- October 22, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us back to the 'Patterns in the Mist' image 
; of October 20 -- two days ago.  In that discussion I commented 
; that the image had minibrots, but they were not very interest-
; ing.  Since then, I have done further exploring and found that 
; the minibrots are more interesting than I had assumed.
; 
; I decided that today's image, which shows a minibrot that was 
; hidden in the earlier image, is worth being declared FOTD for 
; October 22.  The color palette is basically the same as the one 
; in the earlier image, with only a bit of tweaking to emphasize 
; the hidden patterns.
; 
; Now, instead of two levels, we have three levels of near-random 
; chaos.  The strongly colored highlights are seen to be gathered 
; near the minibrot, with the outlying, more vague features sugges-
; ting elements of the actual Seahorse Valley location.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is all I could give today's image, which after 
; all is basically a repeat of the earlier image.
; 
; The name "Unknown Landscape" is perhaps a bit overdone.  The 
; scene does lie in the Seahorse Valley of its parent, so how 
; surprising can it be that the vague patterns resemble the very 
; familiar elements in Seahorse Valley?
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/2 minutes is brief enough to make 
; running the included parameter file worth the small effort.  The 
; small hassle of setting up and running the parameter file may be 
; avoided by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A brisk west wind, showers of leaves, a mixture of sun and 
; clouds, and a temperature of 59F 15C made Thursday a typical mid-
; autumn day here at Fractal Central in central Pennsylvania.  The 
; fractal cats were fascinated by the falling leaves, and spent 
; several hours in their window, trying to decide what was happen-
; ing outside.
; 
; My day was normal; FL's was the same.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if everything is 
; an illusion in the mind, as some mystics claim, in what then is 
; the mind only an illusion?
