; FOTD -- October 23, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The 2-second calculation time of today's image is no mistake.  
; The image is a scene in the best-known fractal of all -- the 
; Mandelbrot set.  And on my particular fractal dedicated machine, 
; the Mandelbrot set runs at faster-than-light speed.
; 
; I originally planned on naming the image "Not Quite Dead Yet" 
; to indicate that the M-set is no tired warhorse on its last lap 
; around the track.  It is chock full of interesting and lively 
; scenes, not only of minibrots, but of countless other undiscov-
; ered wonders.  But then I decided that such a name was much too 
; downbeat for such an upbeat image.  I finally decided on the 
; name "Star of the Spike", which has a far more positive sound 
; and also indicates the location in the M-set.
; 
; The image rates an 8.  I'm not sure how much of that rating is 
; due to my coloring, but I did work on the colors for well over 
; an hour.
; 
; The scene lies on a filament extending from the Seahorse Valley 
; of a minibrot located on the main spike of the M-set, not far 
; west of the main body of the set.
; 
; As I said earlier, the calculation time is an incredibly brief 2 
; seconds.  But there is still the hassle of copying this letter 
; into your parameter file in text mode with a .par extension, 
; hoping that no spurious characters get inserted, then running it 
; as you would any other parameter file.
; 
; This minor inconvenience may be avoided by going to the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; A mixture of clouds and sun, a brisk wind from the northwest and 
; a temperature around 52F 12C gave Friday a very autumnal feeling 
; here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats enjoyed the sun when 
; it was shining and the house heat when the clouds prevailed.
; 
; My day was slow enough to put the extra coloring work on the 
; FOTD.  FL had a slightly more active day.  I think a trip back 
; to Old Fractal Central, 130 miles (200km) south of here, is 
; coming up on Saturday, so do not be surprised if the FOTD for 
; October 24 is late.  Until whenever, take care, and wouldn't it 
; be great if humans had designed the laws of the natural world 
; instead of the great unknown?  (But could we have done it with-
; out fighting?)
