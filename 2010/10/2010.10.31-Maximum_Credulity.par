; FOTD -- November 01, 2010 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was created in the same manner as the image of 
; three days ago -- the `Offside' image of October 29 -- though 
; instead of going off from the center of the period-2 bud in the 
; Rectangular direction, we go off in the other perpendicular 
; direction, the Oblate, until we reach the edge of the Julibrot.
; 
; By some very curious coincidence, in this direction the Julibrot 
; ends on the real(Z) axis at a distance of plus and minus 
; 1.61803...., which strangely enough is the golden ratio.
; 
; Since today's image was created in the same manner as the 
; earlier image and is a virtual repeat, I declined to give it a 
; rating.  The name "Maximum Credulity" came to mind Sunday after-
; noon while I was watching a skeptical show about the existence 
; (read non-existence) of the supernatural.
; 
; Perhaps the best feature of today's image is its fireball-fast 
; calculation time of 5-1/2 seconds, which guarantees that 
; virtually no time will have been wasted if the image fails to 
; inspire awe and wonder for natural numbers.
; 
; Viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; will involve no wishful thinking, and will also guarantee that 
; no time will be wasted if a let-down happens.
; 
; Blustery conditions, accompanied by dark wind-shredded clouds 
; and a temperature of 54F 12C made Sunday a typical autumn day 
; here at Fractal Central in central Pennsylvania.  The fractal 
; cats had their thrill when a pigeon landed on the outside of 
; their lookout window, only inches from Nicholas' hungry jaws.  
; But as soon as Nicholas made his move, the pigeon flew away, 
; leaving Cassie to wonder what all the tail thrashing was about.
; 
; My day was average, even though the FOTD turned out to be below 
; average.  The next FOTD, an improved one to be sure, will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and only the credu-
; lous believe in ghosts.  Since I do believe in ghosts, I guess 
; that makes me credulous as well as superstitious.
