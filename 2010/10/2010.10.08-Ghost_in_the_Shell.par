; FOTD -- October 09, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Sometimes I feel that I give too little attention to the 
; formulas hard-coded into the Fractint program.  Today's image 
; is an attempt to correct this oversight.
; 
; To find today's image, I brought up the 'barnsleym1' formula.  
; Nothing of much interest happened until I tried the active 
; inside fills on the nearly circular fractal.  When I tried the 
; 'zmag' fill, I noticed a curious object on the Y-axis near the 
; top of the parent fractal.  Then, when I started adjusting the 
; colors, I spotted a ghostly shadow figure in the center of this 
; object, almost like one of those vague shadows the ghost hunters 
; on TV pick up with their fancy cameras and then claim they have 
; photographed the ghost of a dead person.
; 
; The image consists totally of 'inside' stuff, though it does not 
; fall into the category of 'evaporated' images.  And for an added 
; bit of fractal excitement, check the apparently totally-random 
; stuff at the lower edge of the chaotic area.  It gets less 
; random and more interesting the deeper one goes.
; 
; When FL saw the image, she suggested I name it 'Pilot Light', 
; but being of a philosophical nature, I named the image "Ghost in 
; the Shell", referring to the hypothetical non-material spiritual 
; entity that religion tells us we have within our physical bodies.
; 
; The rating of a 7 indicates that I consider the image a little 
; above average.
; 
; The calculation time of 30 seconds will pass faster than a 
; wraith in the night.  Those who would rather not be confronted 
; by a wraith may view the finished on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Perfect weather prevailed here at Fractal Central on Friday.  
; In this case, perfection is defined as cloudless skies and a 
; temperature of 75F 24C.  The fractal cats had their thrill when 
; a stray cat, (of which there are many in the area), wandered 
; onto the porch and left a reminder that he had been there.
; 
; My day was slightly busy.  FL kept busy planting bulbs for next 
; spring.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and I'm skeptical of things I cannot see with my own 
; eyes.  That's why I don't believe in unseen things like ghosts 
; and atoms, which are widely accepted by the gullible.
