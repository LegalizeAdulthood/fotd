; FOTD -- October 25, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a "Seahorse Abomination", which is what I named 
; it.
; 
; Seahorse Valley never deserved to have such things done to it.  
; The valley is a nice little place, a four-dimensional complex, 
; so what have we done to the innocent valley to cause the gross 
; disruption apparent in today's image?
; 
; To begin, the image is not a Julia set of the familiar Seahorse 
; Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  It is a Julia set of Seahorse 
; Valley of the Quaternion Mandelbrot set, which is actually an 
; eight-dimensional Julibrot complex, with a 4-D Mandelbrot aspect 
; and a 4-D Julia aspect.
; 
; I'll not go into details about the wonders of the eighth 
; dimension; I'm still working on understanding the fourth.  But 
; one thing certain is that in 8-D space, 28 two-dimensional 
; planes pass through every point, with every plane perpendicular 
; to all the others.
; 
; (There is something puzzling about the two quaternion formulas.  
; Today's image was created by the type=quatjul formula, which 
; plots Julia sets.  This formula has six variable parameters, all 
; of which are necessary if we are to move off from the screen in 
; the six perpendicular directions.  Yet the type=quat formula, 
; which plots Mandelbrot sets, has only two changeable parameters 
; [plus two unused parameters] both of which have the same effect, 
; giving the impression that the quaternion Mandelbrot set is a 
; simple three-dimensional thing that would result from rotating 
; the classic M-set around the X-axis.)
; 
; Be that as it may, today's image, with its minor mathematical 
; interest and only slightly better artistic worth, rates a 6.  
; 
; The fireball-fast calculation time of under 3 seconds will leave 
; little time to wonder about higher dimensions before the image 
; bursts onto the screen in a blaze of mediocrity.
; 
; Those who prefer to remain burst-free may see the finished image 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Sunday here at Fractal Central featured a mixture of sun and 
; clouds, and a very pleasant temperature of 70F 21C.  The fractal 
; cats complained that there was not enough sun then went to sleep 
; on the living room carpet.
; 
; After my trip back to the nostalgia-infested land of Old Fractal 
; Central on Saturday, Sunday seemed relaxing.  (Though I still 
; wish the Phillies had won the NL pennant.)  FL occupied herself 
; wondering why I end my FOTD discussions with so many 'silly and 
; unanswerable' comments.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the generally accepted 24 hours. 
; Until then, take care, and if the belief in God and an afterlife 
; is a defense mechanism evolved to enable us to cope with the 
; awareness of our ultimate mortality, how would society react if 
; it were ever demonstrated beyond all doubt that these things do 
; not exist?
