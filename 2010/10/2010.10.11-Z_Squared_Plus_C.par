; FOTD -- October 12, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's tortured image is another aspect of the little Mandel-
; brot minibrot that appeared two days ago as the FOTD of October 
; 10.  That image was unmistakably a Mandelbrot-plane scene, but 
; today's image is sliced in the Rectangular direction, which 
; leaves little but the same colors to recognize.
; 
; I wanted to do something more with the original image.  My first 
; impulse was to check the same scene in the Julia direction.  The 
; resulting circular hole was not very interesting however.  So I 
; tried the Rectangular direction, and look at what happened.
; 
; To begin, the calculation time increased nearly 100 times to 45 
; minutes, which shows the efficiency of the type=mandel formula 
; of Fractint.  The original 2-lobed basin has been twisted and 
; stretched to a point where it is almost painful to look at.  The 
; central minibrot is stretched into a slit so narrow that it has 
; virtually vanished.
; 
; I did tweak the colors a bit, though not enough to give myself 
; extra points.  The name "Z Squared Plus C" implies that the 
; generating formula is the same; only the orientation has been 
; changed.  The rating of a 6 seems about right.
; 
; The calculation time of 45 minutes will definitely not pass in a 
; flash, which is why I recommend viewing the image already 
; calculated on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Monday began well enough here at Fractal Central, with lots of 
; sun and a temperature of 79F 26C, but at 4pm the sky clouded 
; over and a minor thundershower moved in, dropping the tempera-
; ture to 64F 18C.  The fractal cats took all this in stride, more 
; concerned about food than the weather.
; 
; My day was about average.  Most likely tomorrow will be the 
; same.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and where did we go wrong?
