; FOTD -- October 10, 2010 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates an 8.5, and most of this is pure serendip-
; ity.  Returning late in the day on Saturday after an antiquing 
; trip, I found myself pressed to find a worthwhile fractal in a 
; hurry.  After all, the date is 10-10-10, and I would never want 
; to permit such a notable date pass without an unusual fractal.
; 
; Once again, my old friend the Mandelbrot set came to the rescue. 
; Checking the East Valley area of the large minibrot on the main 
; stem, I found today's curious minibrot.  At first the shy fellow 
; made little impression, but as I began changing and cycling the 
; colors, the present color palette suddenly fell into place.
; 
; Ninety-percent of the coloring was done by the Fractint program, 
; which occasionally appears to be almost conscious of the things 
; it is doing.  I needed to tweak only a few registers to create 
; the image.  The rating of an 8.5 is fully justified.
; 
; The name "Lost in Hyperspace" describes the actual physical 
; location of the scene.  The calculation time of 35 seconds will 
; waste no one's time.  And as always, the finished image is avail-
; able for instant viewing on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Perfect weather prevailed once again here at Fractal Central on 
; Saturday, with conditions an exact repeat of yesterday's.  The 
; fractal cats likely spent the day sleeping, watching the leaves 
; turn colors and checking the stray cats that wandered into view.
; 
; My day was as good as could be expected; FL had a similar day.  
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and those who fear to delve into the mysteries must remain 
; forever unenlightened.  But always remember that one person's 
; enlightenment is another person's superstition.
