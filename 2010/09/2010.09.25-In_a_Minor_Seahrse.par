; FOTD -- September 26, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There was no antiquing trip on Saturday, but I did get talked 
; into an expedition to a large gardening store in Brickerville. 
; Actually, it was a rather pleasant trip, especially when FL and 
; I stopped at a great little restaurant on the way back to FC, 
; where I enjoyed Maryland crab cakes in Pennsylvania.
; 
; When we finally did get back to FC, it was past sunset, and I 
; doubted that I would have time to get the FOTD posted on time; 
; but my luck in the fractal world was exceptional, and I found 
; today's image on the first try.
; 
; I named the image "In a Minor Seahorse" because its parent 
; Mandeloid is so twisted that is is nearly impossible to discern 
; the main period-2 bud at a quick glance.  But by counting the 
; arms of the stars, I soon found the main bud, which is actually 
; one of the smaller buds on the shore line of the main bay.  
; Today's scene lies in the valley leading to this bud, which 
; actually is the Seahorse Valley of the parent Mandeloid.
; 
; I rated the image at an 8.  If I had had more time to work on 
; the colors, I might have raised the rating to a 9.
; 
; But even a rating of an 8 is a bargain when the calculation time 
; is a mere 1-2/3 minutes.  Those who are not bargain shoppers may 
; view the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Near perfect summer-like conditions prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central on Saturday.  The temperature reached a delightful 79F 
; 26C under cloudless blue skies and a refreshing breeze from the 
; west.  The fractal cats enjoyed the conditions while sleeping.
; 
; My day was reasonably pleasant at the garden store, while FL was 
; in her glory.  The next FOTD will be posted in about 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and be skeptical of zealous skeptics.
