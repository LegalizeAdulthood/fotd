; FOTD -- September 05, 2010 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With FL out of town on Saturday, I had Fractal Central to myself 
; for the whole day.  I took advantage of the opportunity by doing 
; nothing, though I did take a quick trip to the Mandelbrot set to 
; find today's FOTD.
; 
; The image is a scene in the Seahorse Valley of a minibrot on the 
; filament extending from the period-2 bud on the north side of 
; the main bay of the larger minibrot at -1.417 on the main spike 
; of the Mandelbrot set.  The seahorse attributes of the location 
; are quite apparent.
; 
; The rating of a 5 indicates that I could take the image or leave 
; it.  Actually, I took it, since it was the only one I found for 
; September 5.
; 
; The name "Deep in Somewhere" came about when I forgot exactly 
; where in the M-set I had found the scene and had to back-track 
; to pinpoint its position.
; 
; The calculation time of 33 seconds will pass in a flash.  The 
; most enjoyable way to see the image however is to visit the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where the finished version is posted.
; 
; The image may also be calculated using arbitrary precision math. 
; But this will prolong the calculation time near 500 times to an 
; incredible 4 hours, resulting, after all that effort, in only a 
; barely noticeable increase in quality.
; 
; Saturday turned breezy and cooler here at Fractal Central, with 
; a sky filled with dark lumpy clouds and only intermittent sun.  
; The temperature of 73F 23C must have been just right for the 
; fractal cats, who were unusually active, chasing each other up 
; and down the long hallway for several hours.
; 
; With FL away at a wedding, my day was inactive.  I had intended 
; to get a lot done, but laziness won out and I spent most of the 
; time watching TV and philosophizing to myself.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and if every human mind is a unique self-aware individual-
; ity, how many different unique individualities would be possible 
; given infinite resources?  If there is no limit, then what is 
; the chance of my ever having come into existence in the first 
; place?  One divided by infinity is an infinitesimal, which makes 
; the chance of my existence in effect equal to zero.  Therefore 
; it is impossible for me to be here writing this.  (Something 
; must be wrong somewhere, but I can't figure out what.)
