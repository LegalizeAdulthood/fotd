; FOTD -- September 02, 2010 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a minibrot in the East Valley of the second 
; largest minibrot on the main spike of the Mandelbrot set.  Yes, 
; yes, I know that the parent fractal is not exactly a Mandelbrot 
; set, nor is the thing at the center of today's image a fully-
; formed quadratic minibrot.
; 
; The parent fractal is a M-set only on its surface.  Deep inside, 
; where today's image lies, it takes on Z^1.99 characteristics.  
; And yes, I realize that the conventional Z^1.99 Mandeloid has a 
; very rudimentary main spike, but the negative value of the 
; second parameter in today's formula reverses things, and instead 
; of absorbing the spike, broadens and fractalizes it, as would be 
; expected in a Z^2.01 Mandeloid.
; 
; I named today's image "Disgraced Minibrot".  The sorry excuse of 
; a minibrot at the center of the image certainly is a disgrace to 
; minibrotdom.  Actually, it is more of a Z^1.99 minibrot than a 
; Z^2 one.  And I'm also uncertain as to whether it's a fully 
; critical minibrot or a perturbed one.  Whatever it is, its sur-
; rounding pattern is unexpectedly striking.  The mini-something 
; at the center does indeed deserve a closer look, though that 
; will have to wait for another day and another FOTD.
; 
; Quite a bit of the rating of an unusually high 8.5 was earned by 
; the coloring, an aspect of fractals to which I have been giving 
; more attention lately.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes is reasonable, but if this 
; is still beyond reason, check the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; An episode with a bit of political opinion is included at the 
; bottom of the parameter file.  Those who prefer to avoid the 
; annoyance of dissenting political views should not venture there.
; 
; Too much heat and increased humidity made Wednesday a forget-
; table day here at Fractal Central.  The high temperature of 95F 
; 35C was anything but comfortable, a fact that the fractal cats 
; could agree with as they stretched on the cool kitchen floor.
; 
; Except for a minor political squabble with FL, my day was fair 
; enough.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and I became a cynic because I prefer to be right.

; While watching the news at lunch break on Wednesday, FL said 
; something about how disappointed everyone is in the failure of 
; 'superpresident' to fulfill his campaign promises.  Unable to 
; control myself, I answered that not everyone is disappointed.  
; Some people saw through the feel-good talk and realized that 
; nothing was behind it.  Expecting nothing, how could they be 
; disappointed when nothing was delivered.  FL then accused me of 
; boasting, and entered sulk mode. . . . See you soon!
