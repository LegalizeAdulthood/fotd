; FOTD -- September 07, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's diversion takes us to a very familiar place -- Seahorse 
; Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  But today we see it in a new 
; light.  The view is oriented halfway between the Oblate and 
; Rectangular directions, and also rotated one degree from the 
; normal.
; 
; At this strange angle only part of the M-set can be seen, 
; stretched over 50 times in the horizontal direction.  In today's 
; image I unstretched the Mandelbrot part far enough to leave it 
; only about 16 times its natural width.
; 
; The remnants of the Mandelbrot aspect of Seahorse Valley are 
; found near the center of the frame, colored baby pink, much as a 
; newly-born seahorse might be.  The rest of the pink stuff is the 
; distorted M-set, with the western part of the main bay on the 
; right and the eastern part of the large period-2 bud on the 
; left.  The foreground stuff is lesser-iteration stuff, which I 
; inaccurately call Julia stuff, since it is found in all planes, 
; including the Mandelbrot.
; 
; The rating of a 7 seems about right.  I put some extra effort 
; into the coloring, though not as much as the image could use.
; 
; The name "Seahorse in Distress" refers to the pink Mandelbrot 
; part of the image, which, even after some unsquashing, still 
; looks quite flattened.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes is fast by any standards.  
; The finished image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; I was a bit relieved when FL arrived back from Havre de Grace 
; safe and unharmed just before noon on Monday, though I had to 
; listen to a half-hour of tales of the big 2-day wedding festival.
; 
; The Monday weather conditions here at FC were near perfect, with 
; lots of sun, a temperature of 81F 27C and low humidity.  The 
; fractal cats must have been worried about FL's absence.  When 
; they heard her car pull into the driveway, they leaped up and 
; ran to the door to meet her.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and listen to the music of the spheres.
