; FOTD -- September 13, 2010 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Being far behind in nearly everything, I cheated a little today 
; and found a quickie fractal in the Mandelbrot image that was 
; posted to the list on Sep 11 by Roger Alexander, using a formula 
; that was created by Paul Carlson in 1998.
; 
; Since the Sep 11 image is basically a tricked-out Mandelbrot 
; set, I found today's scene by checking Seahorse Valley of the 
; classic M-set for a minibrot and transferring the coordinates to 
; the Sep 11 image.  Some parameter tweaking was necessary, but in 
; the end I turned up a fractal (if that's what it is) that I felt 
; worthy of granting FOTD status to.
; 
; Since the image is not of my own origin, (I used the Sep 11 
; color palette as well), I could not rate it.  The name "Carlson 
; Minibrot" gives recognition to the writer of the formula.
; 
; The calculation time of just under 3 minutes is brief enough to 
; make calculation almost a joy.  The image may also be viewed in 
; finished form on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Ample sun and a temperature of 81F 27C made for an acceptable 
; mid-September day here at Fractal Central on Monday.  (I'm still 
; a day behind on the FOTD's, so the weather is for the day of the 
; FOTD.)  The fractal cats must have been totally satisfied.  They 
; gave no comment, verbal or otherwise, about the weather.
; 
; My day was busy; FL's was even busier.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours, maybe sooner if I find a chance to start 
; getting caught up.  Until next time, take care, and take comfort 
; in the illusory reality of the real world.
