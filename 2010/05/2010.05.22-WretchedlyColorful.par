; 
; FOTD -- May 23, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's super brilliant image is also super fast, calculating 
; in an unbelievable 8 seconds.  It is also a rather good image, 
; well worth the minor task of setting up this letter as a 
; parameter file and running it in Fractint.
; 
; The parent fractal was created with the FinDivBrot-2 formula.  
; It appears as a Mandelbrot set surrounded by rings of rather 
; interesting extra stuff, which were created by the Z^(-10) in 
; the iterated expression.
; 
; Today's scene lies at -6.2 on the negative X-axis, rather deep 
; in some of the rather interesting extra stuff.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is not bad, especially for an image that comes 
; about with almost no effort.  I thought of the name "Wretchedly 
; Colorful", while I was still working on the colors.  Since then 
; I have gotten the colors good enough to meet FOTD standards, but 
; the name shall remain forever.
; 
; Viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; will eliminate a bit of computer work, but it could hardly 
; shorten the 8-second wait to see the finished image.
; 
; Lots of clouds marred the sky here at Fractal Central on 
; Saturday.  But the temperature reached 73F 23C and it stayed dry 
; all day, so I guess the day ended up a success.
; 
; The most mentionable event here at FC on Saturday was when FL 
; suggested that we go on Facebook and I disagreed.  When she 
; replied that everyone is doing it, I told her that this is a 
; good reason not to.  People get ahead in the world when they do 
; what everyone else is NOT doing, not when they join the crowd 
; like a flock of sheep.  Then she told me that with all the stuff 
; I write in my FOTD discussions, we might as well be on Facebook. 
; This might be true, but not nearly as many on Facebook have been 
; writing daily discussions about fractals for over 13 years.
; 
; The fractal cats purred agreement.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and the cognitive scientist tells me that I have a brain.  
; The priest tells me that I have a soul.  The mystic tells me 
; that I have a spirit.  But what is the "I" that possesses all 
; these things?
