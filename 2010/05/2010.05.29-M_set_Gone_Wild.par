; FOTD -- May 30, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The one-and-only reference-standard Mandelbrot set is created by 
; the expression Z^2+C.  Minibrots however are another story.  
; They come in all sizes and shapes, sometimes so distorted that 
; the Mandelbrot aspect is all but invisible.  It is much less 
; common to see a parent Mandeloid suffer such extreme distortion, 
; but today's image, which is the parent fractal itself, is in a 
; state of true agony.
; 
; Today's image obviously has Mandelbrot characteristics, but it 
; is quite difficult to recognize the parts of what was once a 
; fully-formed M-set.
; 
; Actually, to better fit the fractal onto the screen the entire 
; image has been rotated 90 degrees, so that west is up and east 
; is south.  In this orientation, the main bay is the open area at 
; bottom center of the frame.  It resembles the bulb of an ear 
; syringe.  East Valley is the tiny dimple on the shore line at 
; the bottom center of this bulb.  Minibrots certainly lie in this 
; area, though I have not yet checked their appearance.
; 
; The two large bays, sprouting like Mickey Mouse's ears from the 
; main bay are the large bud that in the true M-set lies on the 
; negative X-axis.  The bud has split into two separate buds.  The 
; narrow valley, which shoots straight up the center of the screen 
; from the main bay, like the stem of the syringe, is something 
; entirely new, which has no corresponding part in the true M-set. 
; It is in this stem that the most interesting minibrots will be 
; found, but that's a story for another FOTD.
; 
; The fractal also has two separate Seahorse Valleys, located in 
; the brilliant white area where the mouse ears join the main bay. 
; Any minibrots in this area could be quite interesting also, but 
; if they are actually there, they will be quite slow to calculate.
; 
; The calculation time is only 23 seconds because the image has 
; such a low magnitude.  The rating of an 8 includes a generous 
; reward for my coloring effort, which was still not quite totally 
; successful in hiding the iteration bands but did give a pock-
; marked appearance to the image.
; 
; The name "M-set Gone Wild" describes the image.  It has nothing 
; to do with the behavior of college kids on spring break.
; 
; And as always, the finished image is posted in its full glory on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where it may be viewed and studied at leisure.
; 
; Clearing skies and a temperature of 82F 28C graced both Fractal 
; Central and the fractal cats on Saturday.  I was graced by a day 
; off and a worthy fractal, while FL was graced by the best show 
; of roses I have ever seen her produce.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, think logically, but realize that the universe does not 
; necessarily run by our particular rules of logic.
