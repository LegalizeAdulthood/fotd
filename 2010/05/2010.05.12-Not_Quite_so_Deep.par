; FOTD -- May 13, 2010 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us from the East Valleys of large minibrots 
; into totally uncharted territory.  The parent fractal of the new 
; world came about when I combined Z^(-3) with 2 parts of Z^(-1.2) 
; and added (1/C).  This parent fractal is indescribable, but it 
; basically consists of an over-sized figure-eight and a smaller 
; Mandeloid with no East Valley.  The whole works is surrounded on 
; its south side by an even larger sinuous loop.  Today's scene is 
; located somewhere between the figure eight and the Mandeloid.
; 
; At first glance, the image resembles a very deep one, with a 
; magnitude somewhere around 10^25.  Actually, the magnitude is 
; only 10^10, which means no arbitrary math is needed.  (Actually, 
; arbitrary math is not available with type=formula fractals.)  
; This deceptive appearance explains the name "Not Quite so Deep".
; 
; Most of the image's worth is a result of the coloring, which is 
; why I rewarded myself with an extra half-point added to the 
; already high rating of an 8.
; 
; The parameter file runs in a very reasonable 1-3/4 minutes, at 
; least on my fractal-dedicated 2000mhz unit.  On the old but 
; still cooking P5-200mhz unit the image takes over 9 minutes to 
; finish.
; 
; But all concern about running time may be avoided by viewing the 
; completed image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where immediate gratification is the rule rather than the 
; exception.
; 
; The weather was dry, but the heavy clouds kept things suppressed 
; here at Fractal Central on Wednesday.  Strangely enough, the sky 
; completely cleared for an hour just after noon, then, after an 
; hour of bright warm sun, the clouds returned as quickly as they 
; had cleared away.  The temperature reached 64F 18C while the sun 
; was shining, the rest of the time it hung around 57F 14C.  The 
; fractal cats were rather sulky most all day, keeping themselves 
; occupied by actively ignoring each other.
; 
; My day was fair enough.  Tomorrow will probably be the same.  
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and stand in awe of your world image.
