; FOTD -- May 20, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image, a totally graphic black-and-white, is rated at a 
; 7.  Basically, it's a study of what is possible with the pre-
; cooked color palettes built into Fractint.
; 
; To create the image, I returned to one of the old MandNewt 
; formulas, number 6 to be exact, entered some random whole-number 
; parameters, and let her rip.
; 
; I'm not sure what these formulas actually do, but what came up 
; was a virtually blank screen consisting of 'inside' stuff.  
; Never giving up on blank screens without at least a little 
; fight, I applied the 'bof60' inside fill option to the blank 
; screen and was surprised by the result.
; 
; The first image was near total color-chaos, but when I turned on 
; the logmap and applied one of the broad color palettes, things 
; shaped up fast.  Today's image shows the final result, which is 
; surprisingly three-dimensional for a flat fractal.  
; 
; I named the image "Writhing Tentacles" since a tentacle was the 
; first thing that came to mind when I saw the finished image.
; 
; The calculation time of a zippy 49 seconds will pass in a flash. 
; The trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; to see the completed image will pass in a flash also.
; 
; The skies were brighter here at Fractal Central on Wednesday, 
; but the sun was still hidden.  The temperature of 64F 18C was 
; warmer than the past few days, but still fell short of the 72F 
; 22C that is typical for mid-May.  The fractal cats were quite 
; alert most of the day, dashing from one window to another.  I 
; think a stray cat was prowling nearby, though I never saw one.
; 
; My day was a very dull average.  FL's day was a little above 
; average.  The next FOTD, also a little above average, will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and after all these 
; years, I still don't know what a proton looks like.
