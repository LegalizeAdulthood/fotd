; FOTD -- May 08, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image, the 8th of the month, rates an 8.  It is a scene 
; in the East Valley of a minibrot in the East Valley of a mini-
; brot in the East Valley of a minibrot in the East Valley of a 
; minibrot in the East Valley of a minibrot in the East Valley 
; of a minibrot in the East Valley of the large minibrot on the 
; main spike of the Mandelbrot set.  I think I have the number of 
; East Valleys right, but there is no guarantee.  The count of 
; surrounding elements reset itself to a lesser number many times 
; on the way to the minibrot at the center of the image.
; 
; Perhaps the most unusual thing in the image is how it makes the 
; normally routine East Valley scenery shine in a new light.  I 
; tried the other outside options on the image, but they produced 
; results that were either too flat or too chaotic.
; 
; The name "Mysterious East" means just about what it says.
; 
; Unfortunately, the parameter file, using arbitrary precision 
; math, runs as fast as frozen molasses, taking over 1-3/4 hours 
; to finish even on the fractal-dedicated fireball P4-2000mhz 
; unit.  The solution is to view the finished image on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Friday turned out to be a perfectly normal day both with the 
; weather and the work here at Fractal Central.  The weather was 
; partly cloudy with a temperature of 70F 21C, which is just about 
; average.  The work was finished by 3pm, which is about average, 
; and the fractal cats got into trouble, which is also average.  
; The trouble arose when Nicholas tried to take Cassie's catnip 
; mouse and she wanted to keep it.  A loud hiss followed by a swat 
; to Nico's ear gave him other ideas.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and changing the past is the reciprocal of knowing the 
; future.  If one is possible, then the other must be possible 
; also.
