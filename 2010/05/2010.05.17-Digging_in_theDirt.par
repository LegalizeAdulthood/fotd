; 
; FOTD -- May 18, 2010 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image came about when 4 parts of 
; Z^(-1.75) were combined with Z^(-4) and (1/C) was added.  This 
; parent fractal consists of a large central 3-lobed bay, much 
; resembling a clover, with a string of smaller disconnected ring-
; like features extending to the northeast.  Today's scene is 
; located in one of the smaller elements in this disconnected 
; string.
; 
; The entire effect of the image was created by half evaporating 
; the original scene, then rendering the remaining 'outside' parts 
; with the 'tdis' option.  The newly opened 'inside' parts were 
; then brought to life with the 'bof61' option.  And let us not 
; forget the part my coloring added to the overall effect.
; 
; Add all this trickery together and the rating works out to an 
; 8.5.  The name "Digging in the Dirt" has no meaning.  It simply 
; popped into my over-stressed head when I saw the image.
; 
; The calculation time of under 18 seconds will cause no grief.  
; Even less grief will be felt at the FOTD web site, where the 
; finished image is posted for instant and total gratification.  
; The web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Clouds moved in early here at Fractal Central on Monday.  The 
; rest of the day was cloudy with a temperature of 66F 19C.  Rain 
; was hinted at, but never arrived.  The fractal cats occupied 
; themselves getting into trouble in the maze of book shelves in 
; the hallway.
; 
; In my department, things were average, whatever the word average 
; means when applied to a particular day.  And if nothing out of 
; the ordinary happens, tomorrow will be a repeat.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and what is 
; the meaning of a search for meaning?
