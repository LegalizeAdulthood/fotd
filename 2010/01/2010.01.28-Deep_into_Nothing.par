; FOTD -- January 29, 2010 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is somewhat of a letdown, which is why I could 
; rate it no higher than a 6.5.
; 
; The parent fractal is a Mandelbrot rotated 180 degrees, with 
; trouble along both the positive and negative parts of the 
; X-axis.  Today's image is located rather deep in the northern 
; branch of the Seahorse Valley of this parent.  
; 
; The name "Deep into Nothing" came about when I was studying the 
; image and remembered that fractals are made of numbers and 
; numbers are non-material abstractions, which means that, in a 
; strange way, fractals are actually made of nothing.
; 
; The cauculation time of 13 minutes is slower than most, but the 
; delay may be avoided by viewing the finished image on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; It felt very cold here at Fractal Central on Thursday.  The 
; temperature of freezing was not all that cold, but wind gusts to 
; 50mph, 80kph made it feel more like 23F -5C.  And if this were 
; not enough, the occasional flurries of snow would have satisfied 
; the most ardent cold-weather fan.  The fractal cats, most 
; certainly not fans of cold weather, spent the day by the heat.
; 
; My day was spent in front of the computer, which I guess is as 
; good a way as any to celebrate a day.  The next FOTD is due to 
; be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and look half 
; alive.
