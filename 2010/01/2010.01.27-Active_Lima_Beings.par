; FOTD -- January 28, 2010 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In yesterday's discussion I said that the "AllNewDivideBrot2" 
; formula has only one change -- the change of a plus sign in the 
; iterated expression to a minus sign.  Actually there is another 
; small change.  I changed the Z^2 to z*z.  The z*z images are 
; identical and z*z runs a tiny bit faster on my machine
; 
; I have no idea why I named today's image "Active Lima Beings".  
; I guess it's partly because of the brilliant blue, lima-bean 
; shaped patches scattered around the scene.
; 
; The parent fractal is in the shape of an oversized Mandelbrot 
; set rotated 180 degrees, with a grossly enlarged period-2 main 
; bud and much extra detail in the vicinity of East (or in this 
; case, West) Valley.  Today's image is located in this extra 
; detail.
; 
; In my opinion, the image rates an 8 and the coloring adds an 
; extra half-point for a total rating of 8-1/2.  The calculation 
; time of 4-1/2 minutes is slower than ideal, but still within 
; reason.
; 
; Perhaps the most reasonable way to see the finished image is to 
; visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view it there.
; 
; While we were watching the news at lunch today, FL asked one of 
; those questions that gets my philosophical energies active.  In 
; all honesty she asked me what's the real difference between a 
; 'liberal' and a 'conservative'.  At the time I whimsically said 
; we might find out during superpresident's big speech later this 
; evening, but right now, almost 12 hours later and after the big 
; speech, I am still trying to think of a simple reply to such an 
; apparently simple question that would satisfy everyone.
; 
; Lots of clouds, a temperature of 30F -1C and occasional flurries 
; of snow made Wednesday an uncomfortable day to be outside here 
; at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats, who rarely venture 
; outside, spent the day in cozy indoor comfort next to the large 
; warm radiator in the hallway.  The only interruption was when FL 
; stepped on Cassie's tail just after lunch, but a quick treat of 
; tuna made the hurt go away.
; 
; My day was average.  The next FOTD, politics free, will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be liberally 
; conservative.
