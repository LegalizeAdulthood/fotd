; FOTD -- January 11, 2010 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To no one's surprise, the antiquing bug bit F.L. on Saturday.  
; The cure was a trip down to an antique emporium Emmitsburg, a 
; small town in Maryland about 10 miles south of Gettysburg, where 
; the famous battle was fought.  The trip was a success, at least 
; for me.  I found a pile of rare and hard-to-find CD recordings 
; at a give-away price.
; 
; On the two-hour drive back to Central Pennsylvania, FL, noticing 
; the snow-covered landscape, commented that maybe global warming 
; isn't as great a threat as some would have us believe.  I could 
; not stop myself from reminding her that I have been saying so 
; for quite a few years.  (Actually however, the current cold 
; weather is a temporary local thing and says nothing for or 
; against the existence of man-made global warming.)
; 
; But there is no doubt about the temperature of today's image.  
; It is hot!  It's the fastest image of all time.  It appears on 
; the P4-2000mhz screen the instant the <enter> key is struck.
; 
; The name "Mandel Stem Minibrot" says it all.  The scene lies on 
; the main stem of the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The unusual pattern around the minibrot was achieved by render-
; ing the scene with the bailout radius set to 3, which actually 
; cuts off some parts of the M-set, but creates strange effects in 
; the parts that remain.
; 
; Since minibrots on the main-stem of the Mandelbrot set are the 
; first thing a tyro fractalist checks, I could give the image no 
; rating.  But the fact that it appears instantly means that no 
; effort will have been wasted if the finished product, which is 
; just another minibrot after all, fails to bring happiness.
; 
; Those who eschew happiness and those with over-qualified compu-
; ters may see the image in all its completed glory on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Cold weather continued here at Fractal Central on Sunday, with 
; some sun but a temperature of 23F -5C.  After a quick check, the 
; fractal cats decided the heat source would be more comfortable 
; than their window shelf.
; 
; With the antiquing out of the way, at least for a week, my day 
; was reasonable.  It is also reasonable to expect the next FOTD 
; to appear right here in 24 hours.
