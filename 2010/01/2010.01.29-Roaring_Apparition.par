; FOTD -- January 30, 2010 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The Mandelbrot set is universal.  It has a habit of appearing 
; where least expected.  Today's formula might not be the least 
; likely place to find an M-set, but the scene I found when I 
; applied the bof60 inside fill to an otherwise blank screen is 
; certainly a surprise.
; 
; I named the image "Roaring Apparition", a name that has little 
; to do with the image on the screen.  The rating of a 5 indicates 
; that, in my opinion, the colors could use more work.  The 
; calculation time of only 53 seconds means that no time will have 
; been wasted if the image proves disappointing.
; 
; Viewing the already-calculated image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; is another way to avoid a fractal let-down.
; 
; The news item that caught my attention today is the probable 
; abandonment of the program to send men back to the moon and then 
; to Mars.  (I thought it had already been abandoned.)  Too bad 
; all you disappointed trekkies!  Line up beside the disappointed 
; enthusiastic young voters.  When men first landed on the moon in 
; 1969, who would have guessed that in the year 2010, 41 years in 
; the future, we would still be waiting for the next manned deep-
; space program.
; 
; So break out the booze and computer games.  It was all a wish-
; fulfillment fantasy.  The reality is that the earth lacks the 
; resources to send men into deep space, which means that this 
; planet, doomed or not, is the only home we will ever have.
; 
; With brisk winds and a temperature of 19F -7C, the outdoor 
; conditions on Friday  were far too severe for any self-
; respecting house cat to even think of going outside.  The 
; fractal cats, Nicholas and Cassie, certainly self-respecting, 
; cats, had no thoughts of the outdoor world.  They spent a 
; second day by the heat, thinking warm cat-thoughts.
; 
; My day was as good as could be expected.  Hopefully, tomorrow 
; will be the same.  The next FOTD is due in 24 hours, but 
; tomorrow is Saturday, the day when the antiquing bug often 
; bites FL, so I'm making no promises.  Until whenever, take care, 
; and see you in inner space.
