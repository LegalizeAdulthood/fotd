; FOTD -- January 18, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The two most recent FOTD images have featured multiple mini-
; brots.  Today's image continues the same theme and increases 
; the numner of recognizamle minibrots from two to seven.  (Actu-
; ally, I have found fractals with far more minibrots, though I 
; can't remember quite where.)
; 
; Today's multiple minibrots are found in the negative X-axis area 
; of the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid, one of the richest areas I know 
; for minibrots.  Like the seven samurai ready for battle, today's 
; midgets are lined up, ready for whatever action may come their 
; way.  The name "Magnificent Seven" needs no explanation.
; 
; Some minibrots have apparently already seen action, for they 
; appear to have large parts already sliced off.  The minibrot in 
; the center and those in the lower left however are still in fine 
; shape.
; 
; The rating of a 7 shows what I think of the image.  Those who 
; consider a steady diet of minibrots to be boring may consider 
; the image to be worth much less.  But one thing that cannot be 
; denied is that, if the image proves disappointing, the calcula-
; tion time of 21 seconds will have wasted little time.
; 
; Those with absolutely no time to spare for running a parameter 
; file may see the finished image at once on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Clouds, fog, rain and a temperature of 36F +2C spoiled Sunday 
; here at Fractal Central for man and cats alike.  The cats spent 
; most of the day keeping warm, while the man spent the day 
; pondering unanswerable questions and FL spent the day wondering 
; why the man concerns himself with silly questions that cannot be 
; answered.  And out of all this confusion a fractal developed.
; 
; Even more surprising is that the next fractal is already in the 
; works, and will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and when a question makes no sense, (such as why does a good god 
; cause or permit so much suffering), it is often a sign that the 
; question is based on a wrong assumption.
