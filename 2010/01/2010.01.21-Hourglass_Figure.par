; FOTD -- January 21, 2010 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD image shows a scene in the East Valley area of the 
; nearly divided minibrot on the infinitely divided main stem of 
; the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid, which is the area where the strange 
; Julia rectangles are found.  No rectangles appear in today's 
; image however.
; 
; I named the image "Hourglass Figure" for a reason that will be 
; perfectly obvious when the image is seen in person.  And with a 
; calculation time of just under 5 minutes on a fast machine, it 
; will not be too boring a task to calculate and see the image.
; 
; The rating of a 6-1/2 includes 1/2 point for the semi-expert 
; coloring.  Otherwise, I could find nothing in the image worth 
; more than a 6.
; 
; The image may be viewed by starting the included parameter file 
; and coming back in 5 minutes to stare in awe and wonder at the 
; things numbers can do when they put their minds to it.  Or one 
; may visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and stare at the finished image in awe-struck amazement there.
; 
; Lots of clouds, a little sun, chilly north winds and a tempera-
; ture of 41F +5C left the fractal cats unimpressed here at 
; Fractal Central on Wednesday.
; 
; My day began about average but turned rather satisfying during 
; lunch when FL and I were watching the news.  Out of nowhere FL 
; remarked that she was growing disappointed with superpresident 
; and his incredible shrinking promises.  I could not resist 
; mumbling "I told you so" just loud enough for her to 'acciden-
; tally' overhear.  No reply was expected; no reply came.  But FL 
; was rather sulky for a while.
; 
; The next FOTD, promised to meet expectations, will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if the next FOTD fails to 
; meet expectations, I can always blame the other party.
