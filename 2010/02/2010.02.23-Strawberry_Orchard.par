; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- Feb 24, 2010 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To show that there is nothing lacking with hard-coded formulas, 
; I will spend a while with them.  And who knows!  I might even 
; produce some pretty good images.
; 
; Today's image is one of the first I found when Fractint gained 
; the ability to calculate fractional powers of Z.  It is the 
; Julia set of the western edge of the main bay of the parent 
; fractal -- the Mandeloid that results when the formula Z^(1.5)+C 
; is iterated.  I use the term 'main bay' with reservations.  The 
; size of the bay hardly justifies the use of the word 'main'.
; 
; I named the image "Strawberry Orchard".  There must have been 
; some reason I did, but if so, I have totally forgotten it.  
; Maybe it's the strawberry coloring of the fractal trees around 
; the edges of the certral feature.
; 
; These tree-like features are quite fascinating.  With a little 
; work, they can be made to closely resemble real trees, and the 
; result can be quite artistic.  I might have a go at creating a 
; fractal forest for tomorrow's FOTD.
; 
; Today's image rates a 7-1/2, one-half of which is due to the 
; coloring, which was half luck and half work.
; 
; The minimal calculation time of XXXXXX minutes may be waived by 
; surfing to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; Heavy clouds hung tough here at Fractal Central on Tuesday, 
; while a continuing mist kept things unpleasantly damp.  The 
; fractal cats' spirits must have been suppressed by the lack of 
; sun.  They kept to themselves most of the day.  My day was busy 
; but uneventful.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and watch for those alien space craft.
