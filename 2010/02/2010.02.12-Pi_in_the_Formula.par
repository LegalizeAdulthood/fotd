; FOTD -- February 12, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is late.  No excuse.  I simply never felt like 
; writing a discussion.
; 
; Forget + and - Epsilon!  We have moved on to + and - Pi.
; 
; The Pi parent fractal is basically the same as the Epsilon, 
; with today's scene located on the northern edge of the wedge 
; where East Valley would be expected.
; 
; The rating is another 6, and why not?  The image is of average 
; quality.  Ten years or so ago, today's image might have rated a 
; 7 or an 8, but while the world of fractals has moved on, the 
; FOTD images have remained pretty much the same.
; 
; Actually, I have had my share of 'progress'.  The definition of 
; progress is an advancement toward a goal, and I seem to have 
; lost track of the goal.  Oh well, if so many think progress is 
; such a great thing, who am I to differ.  And what would be the 
; alternative? . . . Regression?  (Maybe this would not be as bad
; an idea as some would have us believe.)
; 
; My first idea of a name for today's image was 'Pi in the Sky' 
; but I suspect I might have already used that name, so I named 
; the image "Pi in the Formula".
; 
; The calculation time of 6-1/2 minutes is slower than recent 
; images, but still fast enough to avoid wasting too much time.  
; And no time at all will be wasted when the finished image is 
; viewed on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Total sunshine here at Fractal Central on Thursday made the 
; fresh snow sparkle.  The temperature of exactly freezing made it 
; pleasant to enjoy the sparkle.  The extra serving of tuna and 
; cheddar made the fractal cats' eyes sparkle.
; 
; My eyes sparkled this morning when I finished the snow-removal 
; job and came inside to find FL had prepared a large mug of hot 
; chocolate topped with whipped cream.
; 
; The remaining eyes will hopefully sparkle when they see today's 
; fractal.  If not, perhaps tomorrow's fractal will do the job.  
; For continuing sparkle, check back at this same spot in about 24 
; hours.
