; FOTD -- February 25, 2010 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was again produced by a hard-coded formula, which 
; shows that it is possible to produce interesting images with the 
; good old 'warhorse' formulas.
; 
; There is a strange rectangle in many of the Julia sets of the 
; East Valley area of the large minibrot on the main stem of the 
; Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid, which is in the process of splitting into 
; two separate minibrots.  I have shown this rectangle many times 
; over the FOTD years, but rarely have I distorted it and tracked 
; it to its dissolution.
; 
; In today's image I dissolved the rectangle by raising the 
; exponent of Z ever so slightly to see what effect the change 
; would have on the rectangle.  The effect was dramatic.  The 
; rectangle began to break up and soon totally disappeared.  But 
; it left its ghost behind, and this ghost was made visible by 
; rendering the scene with the inside set to 'bof61'.
; 
; The rectalngle's ghost appears as the 4-sided area of chaos in 
; the throat area of the 'fat man', which inspired the name "The 
; Fat Man Dances".  The fat man figure is actually the 'inside' 
; part of the fractal.
; 
; I could give no rating to an image that is 90-percent mathemati-
; cal interest and only 10-percent artistic, so I let it go with a 
; rating of a question mark.  But it's still a rather interesting 
; image that calculates in a measly 43 seconds, at least on my 
; machine.
; 
; To make things even simpler, the pre-calculated image is or soon 
; will be posted for instant gratification on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A cloudy day with a temperature of 39F +4C here at Fractal 
; Central on Wednesday kept the fractal cats near the heat.  My 
; day was close to average.  The next FOTD will be posted in 
; around 12 hours.  Until then, take care, and fractals defy 
; Occam's razor.
