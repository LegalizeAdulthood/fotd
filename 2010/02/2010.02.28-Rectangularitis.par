; FOTD -- March 01, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Just when I thought I had seen all aspects of the Z^2.003 
; rectangle and had a vague comprehension of its full 4-D shape, 
; I made a slight parameter change and the rectangle went crazy.  
; It became a zig-zag thing better seen than described.
; 
; The rectangle exists in its most perfect form in the Julia 
; plane.  Similar much smaller rectangles exist in the patterns 
; around the minibrots in the Mandelbrot plane, but the original 
; Julia rectangle totally vanishes in the Mandelbrot orientation.  
; The Julia rectangle also extends into the Oblate and Rectangular 
; orientations, and in the rotations between these orientations, 
; though some degree of stretching and skewing is necessary to pre-
; serve the rectangular shape.  I have not yet carefully checked 
; the Elliptic and Parabolic planes, though I have no reason to 
; doubt that traces of rectangularity exist there also.
; 
; Such rectangles exist only in fractals with exponents of Z very 
; close to 2.003.  I have checked the Julia sets of the same area 
; of the Z^4.003 Mandeloid and found no traces at all of a rectan-
; gle.  As to why the Z^2.003 Julia sets seem so blessed with rec-
; tangles, I have no idea.  Only the deity of numbers knows why, 
; and he isn't talking.
; 
; I named today's image "Rectangularitis" and rated it at a 6, 
; which in my perhaps too-humble opinion is what it's worth.  The 
; calculation time of just under 3 minutes seems to be pretty 
; standard for rectangle views when the maxiter is set at a some-
; what excessive 32767.
; 
; All this calculation may be avoided however by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; But keep alert if you view the images on the FOTD web site!  The 
; internet address of the site will change in about one week.
; 
; Sunday here at Fractal Central began with a heavy snow shower 
; that left 2 inches or 5cm of fresh fluffy snow on the ground.  
; But when the sun came up, the snow melted away as fast as it had 
; fallen, and by midday the streets were totally clear.  The 
; fractal cats took it in stride.
; 
; My day was acceptable; FL spent most of the day watching the 
; earthquake coverage on TV-Chile.  The next FOTD, maybe or maybe 
; not more rectangular stuff, will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and except for those who put their faith in 
; reason, it's irrational to believe that all questions have a 
; rational answer.
