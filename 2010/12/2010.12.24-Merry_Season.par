; FOTD -- December 25, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is an unpretentious scene deep on the northwest 
; shore line of the main bay of the Mandelbrot set.  I have named 
; it "Merry Season" because it covers a multitude of festivals 
; connected with bringing light to the darkest time of the year, 
; the winter solstice.
; 
; The most celebrated solstice festival in our culture is 
; Christmas, which unfortunately has become more of a marketing 
; opportunity than a celebration of divine salvation.
; 
; The colors traditionally associated with Christmas are red and 
; green, probably associated with red holly berries.  I have given 
; the image a red and green theme in keeping with the seasonal 
; colors.
; 
; Red and green also remind me of the holly grove back at Old 
; Fractal Central, where the now deceased original fractal cats 
; romped and lurked for almost twenty years.  New Fractal Central 
; has but one scrawny holly tree, but that tree is presently 
; covered with a full crop of red berries, which add their share 
; to the feeling of the season.  The new fractal cats get their 
; share of action indoors however.
; 
; The image rates a 7, fair enough for a mere Mandelbrot scene.
; 
; The calculation time of under 2 seconds is as fast as Santa 
; coming down the chimney.  The finished image is or soon will be 
; posted on the current FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And don't forget the original FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; which Paul has kept going for over 13 years.
; 
; While tending to last-minute Christmas details on Friday,  I 
; heard a version of 'Oh Come Emanuel' on the radio, with drums 
; and traps beating out a syncopated rhythm in the background.  
; I wondered why the beat had been added to such a simple song.  
; The traditional melody is an old plainchant, which has no 
; rhythm.  The only reason for the intrusive beat that I could 
; think of was that over the years the purpose of music has 
; changed from lifting the spirit through melody, to getting the 
; body moving with a catchy beat.  (But then again, times keep 
; changing, and I just might be old-fashioned.  FL heard nothing 
; intrusive in the arrangement.)
; 
; The mix of sun and clouds with a temperature just above freezing 
; that we had here at Fractal Central on Friday made the day just 
; about average.  The fractal cats enjoyed the sun, and when the 
; sun failed, they went to the heat.
; 
; The day of the humans was filled with last minute preparations 
; for whatever may come.  The next FOTD is due in 24 hours, but if 
; it does not appear until Sunday, do not be surprised.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and I don't want to leave the impression 
; that I'm cynical at this time of year.  I want to state it 
; outright.
