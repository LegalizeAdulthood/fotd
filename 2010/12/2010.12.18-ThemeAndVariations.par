; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- December 19, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a variation on the theme of the western suburbs 
; of the large minibrot on the main spike of the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; Even though the image is so distorted that nothing at all of the 
; Mandelbrot shape remains, the name "Theme and Variations" still 
; seems appropriate.  Perhaps a name like "Fiery Cataclysm" would 
; have been more appropriate.  There certainly is a suggestion of 
; an erupting volcano in the image.
; 
; The extreme distortion was achieved by applying the exponential 
; function to initial C, which in effect places the viewer in the 
; middle of the fractal.
; 
; The color palette is merely a slightly tweaked version of the 
; Fractint default palette, which is for test purposes and pretty 
; terrible as color palettes go.  But in today's image the 
; exaggerated colors give just the right touch to the scene.
; 
; The more adventurous might check deeper into the solid parts of 
; the chaotic areas.  They hold a nearly limitless variety of 
; Moire patterns.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is on the liberal side, and the calculation 
; time of 8 minutes is admittedly slow.  The way out of this 
; dilemma is to stop by the new web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; where the completed image soon will be posted for immediate 
; gratification.
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; though I have not checked to see if it is up to date.
; 
; The temperature actually rose well above freezing here at 
; Fractal Central on Saturday, to a high of 36F +2C, with lots of 
; sun for good measure.  But the milder weather was too little 
; for the fractal cats, who spent most of the day on their new 
; favorite spot -- the shelf over the large radiator in the 
; hallway.
; 
; Except for a brief sprint for some last-minute seasonal stuff, 
; my day was quiet enough.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and I sometimes wonder whether 
; the faculty of reason is up to the task.
