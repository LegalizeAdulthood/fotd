; FOTD -- December 06, 2010 (Rating 4+4=8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image has a strange rating.  In my opinion, the image, 
; which shows a surrealistic view of a pyramid, is worth a rating 
; of an 8.  But I found the image on the 'Fractal Creations' CD, 
; in the 'dodson' directory, under the name 'Martian'.  I could 
; not take full credit for the image, so I split the difference, 
; giving half the credit to Dodson and the other half to myself.
; 
; I have no idea who Dodson is, but some real person certainly 
; created the original image, which is a modified rendering of the 
; Sierpinski Gasket.  All I did was take that image and make a few 
; coloring changes, which made the triangle more closely resemble 
; an actual pyramid.
; 
; The name "The Great Pyramid" refers not to the one in Egypt, but 
; to the one we once hoped existed on Mars, next to the hill that 
; resembled an alien head.  The Martian head and pyramid have 
; since been found to be merely light-and-shadow effects, but it's 
; still fun to imagine they were sculpted long ago by a vanished 
; race of Martians.
; 
; The image finishes in a miraculously brief one second.  This 
; short time leaves no excuse for failing to render the image from 
; the parameter file, unless, that is, the fractalist is burdened 
; by a DOS-illiterate computer or an e-mail program that insists 
; on inserting nonsense characters into the e-mail.
; 
; If the image is yet not available on the original FOTD web site, 
; there is a chance I will soon be able to put up a new FOTD web 
; site and keep it current until Paul gets back on his feet.  The 
; original site can be found at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The cold, blustery conditions continued here at Fractal Central 
; on Sunday, which was a virtual repeat of Saturday.  The fractal 
; cats had a virtual repeat of their Saturday, though with more 
; human company to observe their displeasure.
; 
; My day was spent getting caught up in various non-work things.  
; The next FOTD, almost certainly an original, will be posted in 
; all of 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and then take even more 
; care, but do not take too much care, or nothing will be left.
