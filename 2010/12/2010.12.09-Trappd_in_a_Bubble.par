; FOTD -- December 10, 2010 (Rating 7-1/2)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us back to the center of the largest bubble 
; in the December 07 image.  After a bit of exploration in the 
; bubble's depths, I found a not-totally-unexpected minibrot sur-
; rounded by smaller bubbles.  Since the image lies inside a much 
; larger bubble, from which it can never be removed without being 
; changed into something else, I named it "Trapped in a Bubble.
; 
; Today's image shows a minibrot with zigzag filaments shooting 
; off in all directions and terminating in smaller bubbles.  The 
; smaller bubbles of course are filled with still smaller bubbles, 
; etc. etc., down to the infinitesimal.  As the meditating hermit 
; on the mountaintop told the weary pilgrim seeking truth, it's 
; turtles (in this case, bubbles) all the way down.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 is far enough above average to make the 
; calculation time of 7 seconds a real bargain.  I could have 
; rated the image higher, but the main point of the image is the 
; coloring, and today's coloring trick worked its magic three 
; days ago.  Something three days old is never as good as when it 
; was fresh.
; 
; There is an alternative to running the parameter file and wait-
; ing several minutes, and that is to check one of the following 
; web sites for the finished image.

; 
; Even though winter is still 12 days off, Thursday was a typical 
; midwinter day here at Fractal Central, with partly cloudy skies, 
; brisk biting winds, and a temperature that rose from a low of 
; 21F -6C to a high of 32F 0C.  The fractal cats appear to have 
; settled in for the long haul of chilly conditions.
; 
; My day was quite busy, which is both good news and bad.  But the 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, and that is certainly good 
; news.  Until next time, take care, and I doubt that anything 
; truly supernatural or paranormal exists, but I believe that a 
; vast number of unknown things such as ghosts and telepathy do in 
; fact exist, and when, if ever, they are recognized by science, 
; the natural world will be expanded to include the 'paranormal' 
; things, which will then be seen to operate by perfectly natural 
; laws.
