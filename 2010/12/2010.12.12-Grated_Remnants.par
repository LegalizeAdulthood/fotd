; FOTD -- December 12, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As expected, an unplanned shopping trip arose by surprise on 
; Saturday, which kept FL, (and myself also to some degree), 
; occupied most of the day, exploring the Susquehanna Mall, a 
; place that I always avoid assiduously.  But thanks to provi-
; dence, (whatever that is), the task was eventually completed, 
; and we found ourselves back at FC before daylight failed.  This 
; left enough time to find a respectable but not quite outstanding 
; fractal, but not enough time to finish the discussion.
; 
; The generating formula is total whimsy.  I took eleven negative 
; parts of Z^(-1.1) and combined them with 1.1 negative parts of 
; Z^(-11) before adding straight C.  The parent fractal is a most 
; unpromising thing -- an oversized open oval with a small blob 
; and a small wedge floating in its center.  But the wedge is full 
; of detail, and a quick search led me to today's scene, which 
; lies in a more chaotic area of the wedge.
; 
; I named the image "Grated Remnants".  The texture of the eight 
; obvious features surrounding the central minibrot reminds me of 
; a kitchen grater.
; 
; I rated the image at a 7, which is kind of a FOTD standard.
; 
; The calculation time of 8-1/3 minutes could cause a bit of 
; fidgeting among those with too many other things to get done.
; 
; To prevent fidgeting, the finished image will soon be available 
; at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; (But the last I heard, the site at:
; <http://www.fractal-animation.net/fotd2.zip>
; was no longer being kept up to date.)
; 
; I do not know what the situation is at the original FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; I have not heard from Paul in several weeks, though I continue 
; to send the finished images to him.
; 
; A mix of clouds and sun and a not-too-chilly temperature of 39F 
; +4C made Saturday a near-average mid-December day here at 
; Fractal Central.  The fractal cats must have agreed, for when we 
; returned from the shopping, we found them waiting in the window. 
; After surviving the shopping, I had a day that was acceptably 
; uneventful.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 13 hours or so, but with no 
; promises made as to the quality of the fractal.  Until then, 
; take care, and if seven is lucky and thirteen is unlucky, what 
; happens if you combine them and come up with twenty?
