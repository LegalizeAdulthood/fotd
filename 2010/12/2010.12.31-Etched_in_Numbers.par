; FOTD -- January 01, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To kick off a new year of FOTD images, we return to the parent 
; fractal of the fuzzy image of two days ago, which was created by 
; the expression Z^(1.75)+C.  This parent has a disconnected mini-
; brot lying some distance southwest of the main body.  The image 
; of two days ago is located near this minibrot.  The parent also 
; has a smaller minibrot located much closer to the northeast side 
; of its main body.  Today's image is located in a kind of valley 
; in this smaller, closer minibrot.  The name "Etched in Numbers" 
; is true of all fractals, and has no particular significance to 
; today's fractal.
; 
; I have been searching the Mandeloids with exponents between 1 
; and 2 for quite a few years, in the hope that some unexpected 
; treasure might lie hidden in one of them.  So far the treasure 
; has eluded me, but I continue searching.  Who knows, one day I 
; might find it.
; 
; Today's image is hardly a treasure, but it's worth a rating of a 
; 7, which makes the calculation time of 3 minutes almost worth 
; the effort.  The calculation may be totally done away with 
; however by viewing the finished image on the currently active 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And don't forget to keep checking the original FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Friday brought thick clouds but warmer temperatures to Fractal 
; Central.  The temperature of 46F +8C was not quite warm enough 
; for the fractal cats however, and they spent half the afternoon 
; on the shelf over the heat.  My day was pretty settled, as was 
; FL's day also.
; 
; In the afternoon I spent an hour or so on the internet, checking 
; 'Boltzmann brains', which is just about the most ridiculous idea 
; our over-educated scientists have come up with -- so far, that 
; is.  I'll have much to say about these hypothetical creatures 
; lurking in outer space in future FOTD discussions.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and is 
; that a disembodied brain coming up behind you?  (We cannot prove 
; that they are not there.)
