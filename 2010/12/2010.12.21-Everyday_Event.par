; FOTD -- December 22, 2010 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a very lucky one.  My finger was one inch from 
; the delete button that would have sent it to neverland when I 
; decided to make it FOTD for the day.  Nothing is really wrong 
; with the image, but nothing is really right either.  It's an 
; *everyday event*, the kind of image I turn up all the time in my 
; never ending search for a better fractal.  This is what I named 
; it.
; 
; The formula behind the image is Z^(1.95)+C, iterated at ground 
; level.  The parent fractal is quite a bit more distorted than 
; what might be expected from a formula so close to Z^2+C, but all 
; the parts are there, even though they are not so easily 
; recognized.
; 
; There is nothing wrong with the rating of a 5.  It's equal to a 
; grade of 'C', which means average performance.  If its calcula-
; tion time had been a bit faster than 6 minutes, the image might 
; have rated a point higher.
; 
; Those who do not calculate may view the finished image on the 
; new FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original web site is still there, though it is not up to 
; date.  The original site may be accessed at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Wall-to-wall sunshine and a temperature of 36F +2C made the 
; shortest day of the year somewhat pleasant here at Fractal 
; Central on Tuesday.  The fractal cats must have agreed, for they 
; spent most of the day on the shelf by the sunny southwest 
; window.  Most everything else went according to plan.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; they say it's all a dream.
