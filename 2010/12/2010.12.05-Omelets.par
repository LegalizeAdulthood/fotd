; FOTD -- December 05, 2010 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As feared but expected, I had no chance to find an original 
; fractal on Saturday, so I turned to the CD that came with the 
; second "Fractal Creations" book.  In the first directory on the 
; disk, named dodson, I found a fractal named 'eggs'.  I scrambled 
; the parameters and named the result "Omelets".  The image was 
; created by the type=barnsleyj2 formula.
; 
; The image is an 'inverted' one, which basically means it is 
; turned inside-out.  I have never tried this option, so I can say 
; little about the effect it might have on various fractals, but 
; at least in today's image, it makes an interesting picture.
; 
; Since the image is not my own, it would be unfair to rate it.
; 
; The calculation time of 2 seconds will do away with impatience.  
; Those with over-qualified machines may have to wait until the 
; FOTD web site is again up to date.  Actually, I am thinking of 
; posting the FOTD images to our own web site until things get 
; back to normal at the original site.  And the idea of a FOTD CD 
; will not go away.  We'll have to see how things go.  The origi-
; nal FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Typical midwinter conditions prevailed here at Fractal Central 
; on Saturday.  In central Pennsylvania this means partly cloudy 
; skies, brisk northwest winds, occasional flurries of snow and a 
; high temperature just above freezing.  The fractal cats do not 
; like such conditions, so they spent the day curled up by the 
; heat.  My day was busier than usual, making holiday preparations.
; 
; The next FOTD is due in about 6 hours.  It might be an original, 
; or it might be another second-hand one.  Check to see.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and I hear they just discovered a new conti-
; nent north of the Arctic Ocean.
