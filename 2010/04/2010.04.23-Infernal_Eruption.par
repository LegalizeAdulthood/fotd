; FOTD -- April 24, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is an imaginary scene near the edge of a huge 
; volcanic eruption on an alien planet.  The generating formula, 
; 'escher julia' is one of the lesser-used ones hard-coded into 
; the Fractint program.  In fact, I think this is the first time I 
; have used it as the source of an FOTD image.
; 
; The formula generates pseudospherical fractals from Julia sets 
; of the Mandelbrot set, in which the Julia elements are repeated 
; ever smaller as the edge of the circle is approached.  Today's 
; scene, based on an East Valley Julia set, is located at center-
; bottom of the parent circle, where the Julia sets are divided 
; quite small.  Of course, as in all fractals, there is no limit 
; to how much smaller and more numerous the Julia sets become.
; 
; The rating of an 8 includes one full point for the effort I put 
; into the coloring.  The name "Infernal Eruption" needs no 
; explanation.  The calculation time of 1-1/4 minutes will bring 
; palpitations to the heart of the true fractal fanatic.
; 
; Another way to have a leaping heart is to visit the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; and view the finished image there.
; 
; Another totally perfect April day came and went here at Fractal 
; Central on Friday, with clear sunny skies and a temperature of 
; 66F 19C.  But the weather experts tell us that Friday was the 
; last perfect day we will see for quite some time.  This worried 
; the fractal cats not one bit.  My day was average; FL's day was 
; the same.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and why, in our mind's eye, can we so easily remove all 
; objects from the universe and imagine a vast emptiness, and yet 
; be unable to remove the empty three-dimensional space?
