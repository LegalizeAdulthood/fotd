; FOTD -- April 11, 2010 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image has a rating of a question mark.  Since the image 
; is the first of its kind, there is nothing with which to compare 
; it that would determine its worth.  In fact, the object at the 
; center might not even be an object at all.  Even though it has a 
; vague Mandelbrot shape, it certainly is not a minibrot.  Maybe 
; it's nothing more than a near-circular grouping of eight pink 
; almost-fractal trees.  But as the colors show, something is dif-
; ferent inside the circle of pink trees.
; 
; On each iteration the generating expression subtracts 1.08 parts 
; of Z^(-1.3) from 0.72 part of Z^(-2.2) then adds (1/C) to create 
; a humdrum fractal with little to note.  This parent fractal is a 
; sprawling thing consisting of two partially merged main bays 
; with a chunk of chaos in the middle.  Today's image is located 
; in a very tiny valley inside a tiny bay on the west side of this 
; chaotic chunk.
; 
; At this point, words fail me.  The name "Puzzled Predicament" 
; indicates my loss for words.  Since I am out of words, the best 
; way to view the source of the wordlessness is either to run the 
; included parameter file or visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; to see the finished image there.
; 
; Saturday brought near normal early spring conditions to Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cats would have preferred the temperature 
; of 63F 17C to have been a few degrees warmer, but they seemed 
; pretty much satisfied with things the way they actually were.  
; The cloudless sky pleased the humans in the area, especially FL, 
; who started work on her 2010 garden.
; 
; My day was about average for a Saturday; Sunday should be a con-
; tinuation -- that is unless an unexpected antiquing expedition 
; comes up.  If no expedition arises, the next FOTD will be posted 
; in 24 hours, otherwise it will appear in 48 hours.  Until when-
; ever, take care, and the first step to finding a solution is to 
; thoroughly understand the problem.
