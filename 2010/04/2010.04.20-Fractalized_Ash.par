; FOTD -- April 21, 2010 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I might have been thinking of the current volcano excitement 
; when I named today's image "Fractalized Ash".  The image 
; pictures a foreground haze through which a nearly-obscured 
; quadratic minibrot can vaguely be made out.
; 
; My first impression is that the starting point of 0,0 is not a 
; critical point of this formula, but I have never been able to 
; actually track down one of these background minibrots by 
; changing the starting point.  Doing so merely makes all traces 
; of the obscured minibrot vanish from sight.
; 
; The parent fractal appears as a slightly distorted and not quite 
; critical Mandelbrot set with a tiny bit of chaotic debris at the 
; center of the main bay.  Today's scene is located in this debris.
; 
; Curiously enough, other smaller minibrots are scattered all 
; through the debris filling the image, and surprisingly, these 
; minibrots are variations of the cubic.
; 
; I rated the entire scene at a question mark.  Almost all of the 
; value is in the mathematical aspect; very little value is in the 
; artistic.
; 
; The calculation time of 5-1/3 minutes might be more than the 
; image is worth, but it is still interesting to watch the scene 
; unfold as the hidden minibrot gradually appears.  If appearing 
; minibrots are not all that exciting, any remaining curiosity may 
; be quickly satisfied by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; Tuesday brought a repeat of Monday's weather to Fractal Central 
; here in Central Pennsylvania.  The sun was bright, the tempera-
; ture reached 66F 19C, and the fractal cats were as happy as cats 
; can be, though I'm not quite sure how happy that might be.  My 
; day was average, which might or might not be boring.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  It's sure to be a good one.  
; Until then, take care, and if Santa Claus exists only in the 
; mind, what then is Santa made of?  (If anyone says thought, I 
; will simply ask what is thought made of.)
