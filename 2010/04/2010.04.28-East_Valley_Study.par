; FOTD -- April 29, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With nothing better at hand on Wednesday, I returned to the 
; warhorse (but not stale) Mandelbrot set and checked the south-
; east shore of the main bay, where I found today's scene in an 
; infinitesimal spiral in a tiny spiral in a small spiral.  I 
; named the image "East-Valley Study" even though its location is 
; not quite far enough around to actually lie in East Valley.
; 
; As expressed in the name, today's image is basically a study in 
; getting smooth coloring with only a measly 256 colors to work 
; with.  I think I did rather well, and gave myself a whole point 
; bonus, which adds up to a rating of an 8.
; 
; The magnitude of the image is well into the range of arbitrary 
; precision math.  This makes the image a rather slow one, taking 
; a little over 11 minutes to calculate.  As always however, the 
; already-calculated image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where it may be seen instantly and enjoyed at leisure.
; 
; Conditions remained rather brisk for the season here at Fractal 
; Central on Wednesday, but the sun was strong and the temperature 
; reached a rather pleasant 59F 15C.  It was not quite good enough 
; for the fractal cats, who gathered on their window shelf and 
; wondered why the sun, which was so strong outside, was not reach-
; ing the shelf.  When I explained that the angle of the sun was 
; too high, they gave me a puzzled look and went to sleep.
; 
; My day was satisfactory if not over-productive.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and dream 
; onward.
