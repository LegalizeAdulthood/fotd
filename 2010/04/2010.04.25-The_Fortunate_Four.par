; FOTD -- April 26, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "The Fortunate Four".  No one is more 
; puzzled about this name than myself.  The rating of merely a 6 
; indicates that I consider the image to be a come-down from the 
; past several days.
; 
; Perhaps the most striking thing about the image is the obvious 
; black square surrounding the central minibrot.  This square is 
; almost entirely due to the coloring.
; 
; The parent fractal is some kind of weird mixture of Z^(-20) and 
; Z^2, which on the surface resembles an unexceptional Mandelbrot 
; set.  This M-set is unusual however because it is surrounded by 
; blobs arranged into rings, which are loaded with minibrots.  
; Today's image is located in one of these blobs, rather deep in 
; East Valley.
; 
; The calculation time of 3 minutes seems about right to me.  I 
; leave it to the individual fractalist to decide whether the 
; result is worth the effort.
; 
; The finished image may be seen at leisure on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The rain ended by 9am here at Fractal Central on Sunday, but the 
; clouds hung tough through the rest of the day, while the tempera-
; ture of 54F 12C made it feel like November.  The fractal cats 
; slept through most of it until a brief but noisy thunder-shower 
; moved in at 6pm.  When Nicholas heard the crashing and booming, 
; he decided the bathroom closet would be the safest place, while 
; Cassie ducked behind the couch for the duration.
; 
; Otherwise, the day was spent recovering from Saturday's not-
; entirely-surprise antiquing expedition.  Actually, I'm kind of 
; getting to enjoy these Saturday trips around the Central Pennsyl-
; vania countryside, which is pleasantly rural.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and if one actually sees a ghost, would it then be more 
; rational for that person to believe in the reality of ghosts, or 
; to go rational and assume their mind is playing tricks?  Tricks 
; of the mind are real enough, but in reality, what are tricks of 
; the mind made of?
