; FOTD -- April 25, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a fractal object, a fractal thing if you will, 
; located in a valley in the parent fractal that results when 2.8 
; parts of Z^(1.5) are subtracted from 2.8 parts of Z^(2.5) and 
; (1/C) is added.
; 
; I named the image "Things so Deep" because it lies rather deep 
; in its parent valley, and while studying it, I had the distinct 
; impression that I was looking at an actual object.
; 
; The parent fractal was turned inside out by calculating it with 
; (1/C) instead of straight C, and then turned rightside out again 
; by increasing real(p1) and real(p2) to 2.8.  It is a fractal 
; with four large lobes, facing the four directions.  Today's 
; image lies deep in the valley separating the north lobe from the 
; east lobe.
; 
; The rating of a 7 indicates that in my opinion, which is the 
; opinion that counts when the FOTD's are rated, the image is 
; somewhat but not all that far above average.  I tried to make 
; the coloring as smooth as possible, but there are not enough 
; bands in the image to make the borders totally invisible.
; 
; The image is slower than I would have preferred.  14-1/3 minutes 
; is slow by any standard.  Relief is at hand however on the FOTD 
; web site, where the finished image is posted for satisfaction 
; fast enough even for those with the shortest attention spans.  
; The web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A sunny morning here at Fractal Central on Saturday was followed 
; by a cloudy afternoon and a rainy evening.  The temperature 
; reached its high of 63F 17C around noon and dropped to 55F 13C 
; by evening.  Needless to say, the fractal cats were most conten-
; ted in the morning, when the sun streamed in the windows on the 
; east side of F.C.
; 
; My day, as well as FL's day, was good enough.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in around 13 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; be a big-time thinker, whatever one of them is.
