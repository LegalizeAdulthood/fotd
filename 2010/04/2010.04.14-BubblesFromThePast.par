; FOTD -- April 15, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a slight revision of an image that first 
; appeared in April, 1997, the first month of the FOTD.  When I 
; started the FOTD on the Fractal Art list, I expected to post 
; maybe 5 or 10 images, showing that complicated formulas are not 
; necessary for interesting fractals.  Since then I have posted 
; over 4500 fractal images, and the supply of new images is in no 
; danger of running dry.
; 
; I think today's image is the only one I have created with the 
; formula named 'bubbles'.  The formula resembles one of my 
; MandNewt series however, so I might have simply used the same 
; formula under a different name.  Curiously, the formula has no 
; variable parameters.
; 
; Most of the interest, which is in the bubbles, was created by 
; rendering the image with the inside set to bof60.  When the dust 
; settled, I gave the result a rating of an 8, despite the fact 
; that it is not entirely new.
; 
; The name "Bubbles from the Past" needs no explanation.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-2/3 minutes will seem like 30 seconds 
; once the bubbles start popping into view.  Or, to escape the 
; popping, the finished image is instantly available on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Wednesday began with fog here at Fractal Central, but a strong 
; sun cleared away the fog by 10am, leading to a sunny day with a 
; temperature of 66F 19C, all of which kept the fractal cats happy.
; 
; My day, as well as FL's day, was happy also.  The work was light 
; and the fractal, despite its venerable age, turned out pretty 
; good.  The next FOTD, perhaps another blast from the past, will 
; be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and dream fractal 
; dreams.
