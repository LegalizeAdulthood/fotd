; FOTD -- April 05, 2010 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's rather somber image rates an extraordinary 9.5.  I might 
; have rated it at a 10 if I had done more work on it.  As it is, 
; most of the colors are not mine, but were created randomly by 
; the Fractint program in glorious 256-color GIF format.  I did 
; tweak the colors just enough however to earn a half-point bonus.
; 
; The parent fractal was created by subtracting straight Z from 
; Z^2.5 and adding straight C.  This parent resembles a Mandelbrot 
; set with three buds instead of only one bud on its west side.  
; Today's scene is located on the south edge of the valley separat-
; ing the north bud from the center bud.
; 
; When I first checked this area, I almost gave up.  I saw no 
; chance at all of finding minibrots or anything else very interes-
; ting there, but by rendering the area with the outside set to 
; 'fmod' I did find a minibrot, and as today's image shows, quite 
; a good one at that.
; 
; The area is so full of discontinuities that instead of breaking 
; up the image, the discontinuities help create the image.  The 
; name "Resurrection Scene" was inspired not only by what is sup-
; posed to have happened on the first Easter, but by the image, 
; which has become so broken up that it has returned to life in 
; even better form.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes is far more reasonable 
; than the times of some recent FOTD images.  But as always, the 
; finished image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where it may be viewed instantly and without effort.
; 
; Full sun and a temperature of 73F 23C made Easter Sunday a day 
; to be remembered here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats 
; enjoyed most of it, but would have been a bit happier with an 
; extra treat or two of tuna.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and mysteries abound on this day, 
; the greatest of which is, "what species of rabbit lays eggs?"
