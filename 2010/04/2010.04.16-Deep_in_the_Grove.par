; FOTD -- April 17, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image will get little description.  It needs to be seen 
; to be appreciated fully.  The parent fractal is little more than 
; a Mandeloid shaped like a letter V turned on its left side.  A 
; rudimentary East Valley lies at the apex of the parent, with 
; today's image located a short distance east of this tiny valley.
; 
; I rated the image at an 8, one full point of which is due to my 
; coloring efforts.  I worked on the colors for almost an hour 
; before I somehow managed to virtually eliminate all traces of 
; the color-band boundaries.  It is possible to make 256 colors 
; look like 16-million, but it takes some doing and not all 
; fractals can be colored this smoothly.  (I wonder whether the 
; same degree of smoothness will appear on differently adjusted 
; monitors.)
; 
; The name "Deep in the Grove" was the first thing that came to 
; mind when I saw the finished product.  If it ever meant any-
; thing, the meaning is now totally forgotten.
; 
; The calculation time of 5-3/4 minutes is about what the image is 
; worth.  The trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; will be quicker, but the fun of watching the image come to life 
; will be lost.
; 
; Friday was very pleasant here at Fractal Central, with partly 
; cloudy skies and a temperature of 79F 26C.  It stayed pleasant 
; until 6pm, when a thunder-shower moved in from the west and 
; spoiled the evening.  The fractal cats were unconcerned through 
; all of it.  They have no interest in the sun when it's warm, and 
; the thunder was not too loud.
; 
; My day was average, which is all one could hope for.  If no big 
; antiquing expedition comes up on Saturday, the next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until next time, whenever that may be, take 
; care, speak loudly and carry a small stick.
