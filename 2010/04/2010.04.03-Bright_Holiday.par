; FOTD -- April 04, 2010 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Bright Holiday", a very appropriate 
; name.  Today is Easter Sunday, and in Russia the popular name 
; for Easter is 'Bright Holiday'.  The colors of the image are 
; very bright, so I decided to take full advantage of the 
; coincidental situation?'
; 
; The parent fractal is a wonder to behold.  In fact, it's a 
; wonder how it can be called a fractal at all.  This parent is 
; nothing more than a narrow straight vertical stick with buds 
; along its edges.  It came about when I subtracted plain Z from 
; two parts of Z^2 then added (1/C).  The scene is located in a 
; kind of seahorse-tail associated with a bud on the eastern edge 
; of the northern branch of the parent stick.
; 
; The seahorse theme permeates the image, with curly tails beyond 
; counting.  The tiny minibrot at the center is a bit mis-shapen 
; in the SF5 image, though at higher resolution it quickly shapes 
; up.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/5 includes 1/2 point for the extra coloring 
; work.  The calculation time of just under 9 minutes is on the 
; slow side, so why not save the effort and take a virtual trip to 
; view the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today is Easter Sunday.  I am not a believer in resurrecting 
; gods, but I am not a totally disbelieving Atheist either.  My 
; opinion is that something must have happened a couple thousand 
; years ago because a religion certainly did get started.  I'll 
; leave it to the scholars and philosophers to argue exactly what 
; did take place back then.
; 
; Rather hazy skies dimmed the sun slightly here at Fractal 
; Central on Saturday, but the temperature of 75F 24C made up for 
; any solar weakness.  The fractal cats must have thought it was a 
; perfect day, for they were on their best behavior all afternoon.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care 
; in whatever way you can, and look on the bright side.
