; FOTD -- April 07, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "Separated Selves' because it appears to 
; have somehow come apart.  At the center of the scene, well 
; beyond resolution, lies a minibrot.  The pattern around it is of 
; the typical East Valley variety, but in this image the parts are 
; disconnected, with new radiant centers appearing from nowhere 
; within the main pattern.
; 
; The generating expression subtracts 2Z from Z^3 and adds 
; straight C to produce a Mandelbrot set with an extraordinary 
; main stem.  Instead of having a large minibrot on its negative 
; spike, this parent has an open object shaped like an upright 
; numeral 8 centered on the X-axis.  Today's scene is located in 
; the east branch of the valley separating the top and bottom 
; halves of the figure 8.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is all I could give the image.  Maybe if I had 
; put more effort into it, I might have raised it to a 7, but with 
; a serious attack of spring fever that lasted all day, more 
; effort was the last thing on my mind.
; 
; To see the image, run the included parameter file and relax for 
; just under 4 minutes, or forget the parameter file and hop over 
; to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where the image is posted in finished form, ready to bring 
; indescribable happiness to all who venture there.
; 
; I avoided another philosophical debate at lunch on Tuesday.  FL 
; and I were watching the TV news when an overhyped report about 
; the current church scandal came on.  FL turned to me and said 
; she wondered what the big guy up in heaven must be thinking as 
; he sees what has become of his church.  I remained quiet, remem-
; bering that, according to church doctrine, there is no salva-
; tion outside the church.  Well, it now looks like there is no 
; salvation inside the church either.  I guess the devil has just 
; about won the contest for souls!
; 
; Tuesday began with a shower and one grumble of thunder here at 
; Fractal Central, but the rain ended by 8am and by 10am the sky 
; cleared.  The rest of the day was a beauty, with sunny skies, 
; balmy southwest winds and a temperature of 86F 30C.  When the 
; fractal cats felt the heat, they went into their stretched-out 
; postures for the first time this year.
; 
; The rest of the action on Tuesday was average, with nothing to 
; make the day different from thousands of similar days.  The next 
; FOTD fractal image, guaranteed to be at least different and 
; possibly better than today's, will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and perhaps everyone's truth is the true truth.
