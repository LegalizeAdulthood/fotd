; FOTD -- April 27, 2010 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is one of the bluest of all time.  Since blue is a 
; serene color and I seem to see a bit of haziness surrounding the 
; brilliant center of the image, I named it "A Hazy Serenity".
; 
; The parent fractal was created when I subtracted Z^(1.7) from 
; Z^(0.3) and added straight C.  This parent appears as a 
; distorted Mandelbrot set rotated 180 degrees.  It has no main 
; spike pointing east but this lack is made up for by an 
; unexpected area of chaos where its East Valley should be, which 
; is on the west side of its main bay.  Today's scene is located 
; in a patch of this chaos on the southwest shore line of the main 
; bay.
; 
; The minibrot at the center is not rotated to the 'normal' 
; orientation, with East Valley on the right side, as are most of 
; the minibrots in the FOTD's.  I got lazy.  But the minibrot is 
; so tiny that its wrong orientation is hardly noticeable.  In 
; addition, the minibrot is somewhat beyond full resolution.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 includes a 1/2 point bonus for the 
; coloring, which I worked on for almost 30 minutes.  The 
; calculation time of just under 3 minutes is a cheap price to 
; pay for the image.  The trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; to see the image already completed, costs even less, 
; 
; Heavy clouds, occasional rain and a temperature of only 54F 12C 
; made Monday an unpleasant day here at Fractal Central.  The 
; fractal cats were too busy getting into indside trouble to 
; notice the outside conditions.  Cassie somehow wrapped herself 
; in a blanket and was unable to get the blanket untangled when 
; she wanted to get out.  If we had not heard her calling for 
; help, she might have been stuck there for hours.
; 
; For me the day was average, and what could make a duller story 
; than that.  For FL the day was busy, but I gave moral support.  
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours, almost by magic.  Until 
; then, take care, and look onward toward the vastnesses of the 
; world of fractals.
