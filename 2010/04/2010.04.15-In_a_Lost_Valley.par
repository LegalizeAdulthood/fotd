; FOTD -- April 16, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I gave today's image a rating of 8, which might be a bit 
; liberal.  I chose the rating because I kind of enjoy the 
; coloring, and I did most of it myself with only minor help from 
; the program.  And then I named the image "In a Lost Valley".  
; The reason for the name will be obvious once the exact location 
; of today's image is seen in its parent fractal.
; 
; This parent fractal came about when I entered some whimsical 
; values into the MandAutoCritInZ formula.  It is little more than 
; scattered bits and pieces of assorted Mandeloid stuff surrounded 
; by disconnected tiny Mandelbrot sets.  Today's image is located 
; in the west branch of the valley separating the two largest 
; bays.  Since the valley is not really a true one, but a random 
; point of connection between two independent but overlapping 
; Mandeloids, one might consider the valley to be 'lost', which 
; explains the name.
; 
; The calculation time of 4-1/4 minutes is fair enough for today's 
; image.  I leave it to the intrepid fractalist to decide whether 
; the finished image is worth the effort.
; 
; The way to avoid all this concern about value is by zooming out 
; to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; and viewing the already-calculated image posted there.
; 
; A really great day passed unappreciated here at Fractal Central 
; on Thursday, as the sun shone brilliantly and the temperature 
; reached 75F 24C.  I was busy working most of the time, while the 
; fractal cats were busy keeping watch on the stray cats that for 
; some reason were quite numerous in the back yard.  FL spent most 
; of the time thinking about this year's fractal garden.
; 
; If all goes well, and I can see no reason why it should not, the 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and perhaps God is what remains when everything vanishes and 
; then even the empty space vanishes.
