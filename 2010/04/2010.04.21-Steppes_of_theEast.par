; 
; FOTD -- April 22, 2010 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's iterated expression subtracts 1/4 part of (1/Z) from 3/4
; part of Z^3 then adds straight C.  The parent fractal consists 
; of a group of large irregular but connected bays with some areas 
; critical and some not.  Like so many fractals produced by the 
; MandAutoCritInZ formula, this fractal is impossible to adequate-
; ly describe in words.
; 
; In this type of fractal, an orbit check is often the best way to 
; see what kind of minibrots will be found in a given region.  
; Today's scene lies on the shore line of a bay sprouting eastward 
; from what appears to be the East Valley of a kind of Mandelbrot 
; main cardoid. In the closest part of this bay the periodicity 
; is 3; in the middle it is chaotic, while in the farthest part it 
; is 8.  Today's scene is located near the point where the periodi-
; city shifts from 3 to chaos.
; 
; The greenish parts of the image consist of 'inside' stuff made 
; visible by the 'fmod' inside fill.  The mathtolerance entry was 
; needed because the extreme magnitude of the image could cause 
; the scene to calculate at a lesser magnitude, producing a wrong 
; image.  The terraced appearance was achieved by setting the 
; 'outside' to 'tdis'.
; 
; The rating of 6-1/2 shows my indecision.  If I had worked a bit 
; harder on the coloring, I might have been able to raise the 
; rating to at least a 7.
; 
; The name "Steppes of the East" invokes feelings of the Gobi 
; desert, though I can see no logical connection between that part 
; of the world and today's fractal.
; 
; The calculation time of just under 2 minutes is not too slow.  
; Neither is the trip to see the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A near-perfect day prevailed here at Fractal Central on Wednes-
; day.  The hazy sunshine, gentle winds and temperature of 68F 20C 
; made it feel almost like a day in June.  But June turned to 
; April at 6pm, when a gusty shower moved in from the west and the 
; temperature dropped to 55F 13C.
; 
; The fractal cats found a bit of excitement when Nicholas caught 
; sight of a crow hopping around in the yard and Cassie came 
; running to see what Nico was chattering at.  The rest of the 
; time the duo spent sleeping, chasing one another up and down the 
; hallway and asking for food.  The next FOTD, maybe better or 
; maybe not, will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and be a fool.  Being a fool is more fun.
