; FOTD -- July 01, 2010 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Have no concern about today's parameter file, which includes no 
; color information.  The program will automatically pick up the 
; default color palette, which works quite well with this image.
; 
; How can a person rate a mistake?  They cannot!  So how could I 
; give a rating to today's image?  It is an error.  With the 
; type=julzpower formula on the screen I decided to try some-
; thing with the Julia set of Seahorse Valley of the Mandelbrot 
; set.  But instead of entering 2 as the exponent, I entered 
; minus-2, and look what happened.
; 
; I have no idea how I could have missed such an obvious fractal 
; for such a long time, but I did.  Anyway, I post the image as 
; today's FOTD.  It will never set any world record, but it is 
; interesting and it calculates in a faster-than-light 4 seconds.
; 
; The name "Jim's Blunder" says it all.  The result may be seen by 
; running the included parameter file or by going to the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where the finished image is posted for instant if not total 
; gratification.
; 
; Absolutely perfect weather here in the Fractal Central area on 
; Wednesday made for an enjoyable day in the outdoors for FL and 
; myself.  The total sun, low humidity and high temperature of 77F 
; 25C that marked the day could hardly be improved upon.
; 
; The fractal cats showed their approval by getting into trouble 
; while FL and I were traversing a local hiking trail.  When we 
; returned, we found a lamp overturned and two totally innocent 
; looking cats.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in around 12 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and do what the doctor says.
