; FOTD -- July 10, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Well, the cool air is up and running again here at FC, and in a 
; day or two, things should be back to normal.  Until then, we 
; will have a couple undistinguished but still pleasant fractal 
; images to enjoy.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is a strange thing that came 
; about when I combined 3 parts of Z^(-3) with 7 parts of Z^(-1.5) 
; and added (1/C).  It is best described as a single large 
; rectangular bay with rounded corners, surrounded by a cloud of 
; satellite minibrots.  Today's image is located in the Seahorse 
; Valley of one of these satellites on the east side of the main 
; bay.
; 
; The name "Diamond Festival" is one of those phrases that seems 
; to have a deep between-the-lines meaning.  Actually, it has no 
; inner meaning at all.  I chose it simply because, like the old 
; song 'Stairway to Heaven' it causes the ears to perk up and the 
; mind to exercise itself searching for a deep meaning that does 
; not exist.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is not too bad considering that we're still 
; struggling here at FC to get caught up in the work that backed 
; up while the cool air was down.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-3/4 minutes will pass in somewhat less 
; than a flash.  The full flash may be experienced by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; With a high temperature of 95F 35C here at Fractal Central on 
; Friday, and more clouds obscuring the sun, I guess one might say 
; the heat wave was broken.  But the higher humidity made it every 
; bit as uncomfortable as Thursday, when the official high was 
; 104F 40C.  The only good news was the high humidity, which makes 
; rain more likely.  (We have a pretty serious drought in progress 
; here at FC in Central Pennsylvania, and the farmers are praying.)
; 
; The fractal cats spent the morning on the cool tile floor in the 
; kitchen.  When the air conditioning finally came on in the 
; afternoon, they shifted to the cool air vent.  My day was quite 
; busy getting caught up in the work.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if reality is 
; not real, then what is it?
