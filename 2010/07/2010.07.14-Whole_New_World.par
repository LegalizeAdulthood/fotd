; FOTD -- July 14, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There are minibrots and there are more minibrots, and then there 
; are things like the minibrot in today's image.  I'm not sure if 
; it's a minibrot or not.  If either or both real(p3) and real(p4) 
; are changed to zero, the image becomes just another scene not 
; too deep in Seahorse Valley of the Mandelbrot set, but when 
; real(p3) is set to 0.77 and real(p4) is set to the reciprocal of 
; one-googol, the minibrot fills with totally new stuff, which can 
; be zoomed into and explored, and therefore is not an artifact.
; 
; The formula draws the hypercomplex Mandelbrot set, and it does 
; so quite well.  But how is it possible that a value as infinites-
; imal as the 10^-100 of real(p4) can make such a difference in 
; the image?
; 
; Regardless of how the image came about however, a whole new 
; world lies inside the minibrot, waiting to be explored.  I'll do 
; a little exploration in tomorrow's FOTD, but I really want to 
; get that FOTD web-site logo finished.
; 
; The rating of an 8 is based on the mathematical interest.  The 
; artistic value of the image is everyday average.  The calcula-
; tion time of 1-1/4 minutes will cause no pain to any fractal 
; fanatic.
; 
; The image is also available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where if all goes well, the FOTD logo will soon be seen in its 
; full glory!
; 
; Nondescript weather prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Tuesday.  This means partly cloudy skies and a temperature of a 
; humid 84F 29C.  The fractal cats ignored the outside conditions 
; and clung to the cool air most of the day.  In my department the 
; work was busy, but thanks to FL, it was finished without a 
; hitch.  Unfortunately however, due to the rush, the FOTD web 
; site logo remains in the rudimentary stage.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and I hear that Australia recently recorded the lowest 
; temperature in that nation's history.  This could mean that all 
; the fuss about global warming has been a false alarm, but more 
; likely, we're confusing weather with climate.
