; 
; FOTD -- July 22, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When the going gets tough, the tough get going . . . to the 
; Mandelbrot set for their fractals.  Things were a bit tough here 
; at FC on Wednesday, so I got going to the M-set.
; 
; I checked one of the 'perturbed' sets and found a super-spiral 
; at the edge of a small period-26 ghost-bud on the southern shore 
; line of the main bay of the M-set.  A quick bit of fancy color 
; work produced today's image.
; 
; I named the image "Infinite MegaSpiral".  The spiral is a huge 
; one, sure to please every fan of fantastic spirals, and it goes 
; on down to infinity.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is held down by the over-familiarity of the 
; Mandelbrot set.  The 'perturbed' sets are less familiar, but 
; also less pleasing.
; 
; The calculation time of 10 seconds is faster than light, which 
; means the calculation will finish a few seconds before it begins.
; 
; The way to avoid such paradoxes is to view the image already 
; calculated on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Heat and humidity made things rather unpleasant for both man and 
; cats here at Fractal Central on Wednesday.  But the weather took 
; a sudden turn for the better at 6pm, when a sharp thunder-shower 
; moved in and dropped the temperature from the high of 93F 34C to 
; a comfortable 75F 24C.  And the 1cm of rain was just what FL's 
; garden needed.  The fractal cats ducked for cover when a sudden 
; crack of thunder from a nearby lightning strike shook the house, 
; but showed their noses as soon as the all-clear was sounded.
; 
; My day was busy enough to keep concern away and slow enough for 
; me to find a quick scene in the workhorse Mandelbrot set.  The 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and be aware that, for some reason, the type=mandel formula of 
; Fractint actually calculates the square root of the complex 
; number that is entered as the parameter.
