; FOTD -- July 12, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is located in the middle of nowhere.  Well, it's 
; actually located in a parent fractal resembling a Mandelbrot 
; set starting to split apart along its negative X-axis.  The 
; scene lies in the apparently empty space between the two spread-
; apart branches of the parent's Scepter Valley.
; 
; When I first rendered today's image in the usual manner, it was 
; a total flop.  But thanks to Fractint's various rendering 
; options, I raised the total flop to a rating of an impressive 8.
; 
; The delicate and decorative fern-like features jutting in from 
; the edges consist of 'outside' stuff exaggerated by the 'atan' 
; option; the soft, gently colored aura surrounding the order-3.5 
; minibrot is 'inside' stuff made visible by the 'fmod' option.  
; Put all of this together and the image honestly earns its 8.
; 
; The name "Arc-Tangent Does It" came to mind when I tried the 
; 'atan' feature on the original near-hopeless image and saw the 
; unexpected improvement.  Re-rendering the scene with the 'fmod' 
; inside was an afterthought.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/4 minutes will pass swiftly once the 
; full glory of the scene becomes apparent.  It will take even 
; less time to view the image already calculated on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; According to the fractal cats, a splendid day prevailed here at 
; Fractal Central on Sunday.  The humidity was quite low and the 
; sky was completely cloud-free all day.  True, the temperature of 
; 88F 31C was on the warm side, but the dry air kept things quite 
; comfortable.
; 
; With the work caught up after a hectic week, my day was spent 
; trying to relax.  My next task is to stay caught up and relaxed 
; so I can finish a logo for the FOTD web site.  I have the 
; design, which includes some 4-D stuff, worked out, but I have 
; not yet done the footwork.  FL spent the day Sunday giving hints 
; that it was her XX'th birthday.  (I had not forgotten.)
; 
; If all goes well, and even if it does not, the next FOTD is 
; quite likely to be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and iterate wildly.
