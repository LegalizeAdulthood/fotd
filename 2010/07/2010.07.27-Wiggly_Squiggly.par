; FOTD -- July 27, 2010 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; An image recently posted on the Fractint list resembles a fleet 
; of shiny alien space craft deploying in outer space for an 
; attack on earth.  When I was a far younger person, (think age 
; 20), I kind of believed in (or hoped for) aliens from space 
; visiting earth.  I assumed that all those reports of unidenti-
; fied flying objects and all those fuzzy photographs could not 
; possibly all be wrong.  I supposed that someone with a good 
; camera would eventually take a clear photo of one of the alien 
; ships and perhaps even a clear photo of an alien itself.  Too 
; bad I had to change my mind.
; 
; The belief was a lot of fun.
; 
; Today it is becoming blatantly obvious that all the reports of 
; aliens and their ships, as well as all the fuzzy photographs, 
; are nothing more than a lot of fun, and always have been.  The 
; thing that changed my mind is the fact that nowadays there are 
; billions of people traveling about with ready-to-aim-and-shoot 
; cameras, yet as far as I know, not a single clear picture of an 
; alien space craft has ever been taken.  By this time, if the 
; aliens actually were here, the laws of chance alone would have 
; produced hundreds, even thousands of clear photographs of the 
; aliens and their ships.
; 
; What a let-down.
; 
; But there is a consolation prize.  When I was a far younger 
; person, (20), I thought all the reports of paranormal phenomena 
; were a pile of wishful-thinking stuff.  Since then however, I 
; have had enough personal experiences to convince me, despite the 
; rational disagreement of skeptics, that this universe of ours 
; has more dimensions and more unknown stuff happening than we can 
; imagine, and a growing number of physicists seem to share my 
; opinion.
; 
; See what a simple fractal fleet of alien space ships can do!
; 
; Today's FOTD fractal makes no such grandiose claims.  It is 
; simply a scene in the Z^(2.5)+C Mandeloid as it appears 20 
; levels up the ladder when no function is applied.  Being purely 
; of average quality, the image rates a purely average 5.  The 
; name "Wiggly Squiggly" has nothing to do with an old cartoon 
; rabbit.  It simply describes a marginally impressive aspect of 
; the image.
; 
; The best feature of today's FOTD is the calculation time of 
; 5-2/3 minutes, most of which can be saved by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; BTW, I usually prefer simplicity in my designs, but the new FOTD 
; logo might be a bit too simple.  I might consider adding some 
; interesting but not distracting fractal patterns to the sides of 
; the central gothic arch.  I am undecided.
; 
; Absolutely perfect weather held forth all day Monday here at 
; Fractal Central.  The temperature of 81F 27C was made even more 
; pleasant by low humidity, while the kodachrome blue skies and 
; puffy white clouds added the perfect backdrop.  (Too bad they no 
; longer make Kodachrome film.)  All this perfection passed far 
; over the fractal cats' heads.  They spent most of the day 
; sleeping.
; 
; My day was average; tomorrow will likely be a repeat.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; keep looking up.  You probably will see no alien ships, but the 
; sky is filled with countless other equally interesting things.
