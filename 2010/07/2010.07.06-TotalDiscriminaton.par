; FOTD -- July 06, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After 3 days in the (near) pristine wilderness, it's good to be 
; back at the fractal desk.  At least the cats must think so.  I 
; have never seen them demanding so much attention.
; 
; Today's image is a quickie, and as such, can rate no more than a 
; 6.  The parent fractal is a near-shapeless thing that at first 
; glance appears totally non-critical.  Today's scene is located 
; in a debris-filled hole lying a short distance northwest of the 
; main body.
; 
; Much of the image consists of holes, which cause the swiss-
; cheese effect.  The rating of a 6 equals just the slightest 
; above average.  The name "Total Discrimination" once meant 
; something, but the meaning has long since been forgotten.  The 
; calculation time of 3 minutes may be saved by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The 3 days' vacation went reasonably well, even though I almost 
; got into a dispute with FL.  While watching a soaring eagle, she 
; commented how enjoyable it was to get away from the hectic every-
; day world, and said she hoped we soon do something about climate 
; change.  I saved the day by remaining silent.
; 
; The heat wave remained in full force here at Fractal Central on 
; Monday, with blazing hot sun, little wind and a temperature of 
; 97F 36C.  The fractal cats were so glad to see us return that 
; they forgot about the heat.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and do your part to fight climate change.
; 
; (IMO, 'climate change' is real, the climate always changes, but 
; the danger is grossly exaggerated by the media, which is motiva-
; ted by profit and politics.  And I doubt that the planet would 
; obey any laws we might pass to fight the change.)
