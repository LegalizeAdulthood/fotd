; FOTD -- July 31, 2010 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows an anti-minibrot, or maybe a negative 
; minibrot, depending on what one chooses to call fractal hills 
; instead of basins.  Whatever the thing in today's image is 
; called, it is the opposite of a minibrot.
; 
; The area with the lowest iteration count lies at the center 
; rather than at the edges, and the number of elements is arranged 
; in decreasing powers of two as the center is approached rather 
; than in increasing powers of two.
; 
; This arrangement makes a mockery of Fractint's automatic logmap 
; feature, which sets the logmap to the lowest iteration count it 
; finds at the edges of the frame.  In today's image the lowest 
; count is at the center, causing the automatic logmap feature to 
; set the logmap to a number that is far too high.
; 
; The parent fractal is a normal Mandelbrot set -- normal on the 
; surface, that is.  In its depths, where today's image lies, it 
; is anything but normal.  The deeper one dives into the parent, 
; the more things take on order-16 characteristics.
; 
; Today's scene is located in a bit of debris in the main bay of a 
; half-morphed minibrot lying in the trunk of an elephant on the 
; southeast shore line of the large minibrot on the west branch of 
; the filament extending from the period-3 bud on the north shore 
; line of the main bay of the parent Mandelbrot set.  (After 
; reading this guide I doubt I'll ever find the location.)
; 
; I named the image "No Minibrot Here".  There certainly are 
; minibrots in the arms, but they lie well beyond resolution.  The 
; rating of a 7 shows that I rather like the image.  The calcula-
; tion time of 2-1/3 minutes means the image is an efficient one.
; 
; Calculation may be totally avoided by viewing the finished image 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The weather was perfect here at Fractal Central on Friday, with 
; a temperature of 82F 28C, low humidity and mostly sunny skies.  
; The fractal cats made the most of things when they started 
; chasing each other up and down the hallway, filling FC with the 
; rumbling thunder of cat-paws.
; 
; My day was uneventful; FL's day was the same.  I hear rumors 
; that an antiquing trip is planned for tomorrow, so if the next 
; FOTD is late, you will know why.  Until whenever, take care, and 
; with all the cameras in circulation, why has no one ever gotten 
; a clear photo of a bigfoot?  Could it be that bigfoot is nothing 
; more than another fantasy, believed by those who want to believe?
