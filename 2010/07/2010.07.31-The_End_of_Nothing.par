; FOTD -- August 01, 2010 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is another example of an anti-minibrot, and quite 
; a fine example at that.  The ten arms do not converge on a basin 
; with a minibrot at the center, they converge on a hill, though 
; at this scale it would best be called a pimple.  The name "The 
; End of Nothing" indicates that nothing at all lies at the center 
; of attraction.
; 
; I would like to actually reach the center of the hill, but 
; unfortunately, it is well beyond resolution.  It is unlikely 
; however, that much of interest would lie there.  I doubt that 
; the iteration count would drop as low as one, but I would like 
; to see exactly how low it goes.  (Like a limbo dancer.)
; 
; The parent fractal is a Mandelbrot set with strange innards.  
; Today's scene is located in the period-10 radical on the south-
; east shore line of the main bay, which probably explains the 10 
; converging arms.
; 
; The rating of an 8 owes a full point to the coloring, which I 
; actually spent nearly an hour on.  Otherwise, the image is worth 
; a not-bad 7.
; 
; The calculation time of 2 minutes is a bargain for such an 
; unexpected scene.  Viewing the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site is another bargain.  The web site may be accessed at:

;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The conditions were good here at Fractal Central on Saturday.  
; The low humidity made the high temperature of 86F 30C felt quite 
; pleasant.  The only problem was the sky, which held too much of 
; a gray tint and not enough kodachrome blue.  The fractal cats 
; slept through the afternoon.  (The present fractal cats, Cassie 
; and Nicholas, are actually the second set of fractal cats.  The 
; original fractal cats, Thomas and Tippy, are gone.)
; 
; My day was busy keeping FL company while she checked the stuff 
; other people threw out.  But what the heck, I'm starting to 
; rather enjoy these antiquing trips.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and don't fall for 
; the hype when the media tries to tell you what to worry about.  
; Almost all of it is a pile of unmentionable stuff.
