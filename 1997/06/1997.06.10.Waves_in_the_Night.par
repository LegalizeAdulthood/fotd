; Fractal visionaries:
; About eight years ago, when I saw the Mandelbrot set appear on my screen
; for the first time, the first area I examined was Seahorse Valley.  I
; don't think it had been given its name yet, but it was the most
; interesting area of the whole set.  Since that time, Seahorse Valley,
; located at -0.75, has been my favorite place to go when I wanted a good
; fractal with as little work as possible.
; I never did find a seahorse as convincing as the elephants parading out
; of East Valley; I saw only their tails.  But that doesn't matter -- I'm
; sure the seahorses are there.  Otherwise, why would it have been named
; Seahorse Valley.
; Today's fractal, which I named "Midnight" because of the somber colors,
; is an oblique slice of Seahorse Valley, best viewed in reduced light.  I
; won't even attempt to describe the orientation of the slice.  I can say
; only that it is near horizontal, but off to the side and tilted at
; something like a 10 degree angle.
; These oblique planes of the M-set are filled throughout with swirling
; and stretching elements, much as in today's image.  But the rippling
; effect where the two prominent center elements skew off the plane of the
; screen is new to me.  Nothing like it appears anywhere in the classic
; Mandelbrot or Julia sets.
; I'm becoming a bit hooked on the oblique slices of the Julibrot, which
; are virtually unexplored.  When that happens there's nothing to do but
; explore like crazy until my enthusiasm runs its course.  So bear with me
; if I post a few more oblique images.  I'll soon return to fancier
; fractals.
; As is always the case, the finished image has been posted to a.b.p.f.
; and a.f.p. for convenience.
