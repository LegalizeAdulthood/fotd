; Fractal visionaries:
;
; My Fractal of the Day series seems to have taken on a life of its own.
; You can imagine my surprise when I returned from my short break and
; checked my mailbox only to find the F.O.T.D. 29-06 waiting.  Lee did a
; fine job in my absence.  The image itself is most interesting.  It took
; about an hour to draw a 1024x768 version at 100mhz, but it was worth the
; effort.
;
; I can see why Lee named his picture "Land of the Lost".  It reminds me
; of a view from high overhead of a devastated area, with smoke, fire and
; ruination still everywhere.  I've never been too interested in the PHC
; trick of overlaying different images to get the effect of more colors
; than are actually available.  Of course this may be because I've seen
; such images only at a resolution of 1024x768 -- the limit of my
; monitor.  And at that resolution the checkerboarding is still visible.
; Later this year when I purchase my new machine, I'll pick one with
; 1600x1200 capability.  Maybe then I'll change my mind.
;
; But even now, I see potential in this method.  I especially admire the
; effect of overlying haze, most evident in the lower right part of the
; picture.  This method could be used to create atmospheric effects in
; fractal landscapes.  Perhaps some fractal artists are already doing
; this.
;
; One thing is immediately apparent: when true true color arrives, we're
; going to need something other than those awkward and unattractive
; equal-iteration bands to define the colors.  Some of the methods I've
; seen discussed in this group have great potential.  I'll be glad when I
; have the equipment to give them a fair test.
;
; Today's fractal is named "balloon".  I named it because it appears to be
; a square pattern printed on an inflating balloon.  It's a version of the
; Z^(-3) mandeloid turned inside out by the C^8 in the reiterative
; section.  I colored it rather hastily, but it's still an acceptable
; picture.
;
; The finished image has been posted to a.b.p.f. and a.f.p.  Tomorrow,
; I'll explore one of the more remote planes of today's figure.
