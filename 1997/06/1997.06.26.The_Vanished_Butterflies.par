; Fractal visionaries:
; Today's fractal looks like an object of some sort, but I just can't
; place what it is that the picture reminds me of.  One thing that
; immediately comes to mind is that wonderful series of "Circle Limit"
; drawings by M.C. Escher, where the objects increase to infinity as the
; limit of the circle is approached, almost as though they were imbedded
; in a space of constant negative curvature.  But if this is the case,
; today's fractal should have been called "Octagon Limit".
; This fractal is a good example of the type of image I prefer -- one that
; subtly hints at something familiar without actually picturing it.  It is
; this hint of familiarity that turns people on to fractals, just as it
; does to art of all kinds.
; There is no reason for people to be put off by the mathematical aspect
; of fractals.  One can appreciate a rainbow without an understanding of
; the laws of reflection and refraction.  One can also appreciate a
; fractal without understanding the complex math behind it.  In fact, I no
; longer bring up the topic of math unless I see that the person is
; actually interested in it.
; The world around us is filled with fractal shapes.  It always has been
; filled with fractal shapes -- we simply did not recognize them before we
; discovered fractals.  When I see the mountains and clouds, I see
; fractals; when I see a leaf, I see a fractal network; when I see the
; Arctic ice cap photographed from a plane, I see a fractal pattern.  When
; I see a fractal on the screen, I see these physical things and much
; more.
; Certainly some of those fractal patterns that remind us of nothing
; actually do have undiscovered physical counterparts, perhaps on other
; planets, perhaps yet undiscovered on our own.  And I never stop
; wondering the ultimate thought -- is the universe the greatest fractal
; of all?
; Today's fractal may not be the greatest fractal of all, but it's an
; acceptable one.  After all, it's difficult to come up with the greatest
; fractal of all every day.  The image is that of an obscure slice of the
; (-Z)^1.1 mandeloid.  The finished image has been posted as always to
; a.b.p.f. and a.f.p.
; For tomorrow -- who knows.  We'll just have to wait and see.
