; Fractal visionaries:
; Last evening, I promised an IF-ELSE fractal for today, and I've found
; one worth sharing.  My own first efforts at IF-ELSE formula writing have
; failed to find anything of interest, so I took a formula posted a few
; days ago by Ron Barnett, added a few variable parameters to it, and set
; it loose.
; It didn't let me down.  This formula has no end of great fractals in
; it.  Today's picture is just one of a dozen or so equally striking ones
; this formula has produced.  The coloring is in my preferred style of
; looking toward the source of light.  I hope you enjoy it.
; In a month or so, I'll start shopping for a new computer to replace my
; poor old overworked 486.  Before I buy, I plan on doing a speed test, by
; running the same test fractal on different machines.
; I also hear various rumors I'd like to check.  I've heard it claimed
; that the MMX technology sacrifices accuracy for speed, and that its
; fractal performance is therefore compromised.  I've also heard that the
; Pentium Pro, (40686), is optimized for 32-bit apps.  I'm curious to see
; if this affects its fractal performance.  The new Pentium II processors
; appear interesting.  I'm curious to see how they compare with the
; Pentium Pro.
; Well, while I'm dreaming of my new computer, I'd better send this off
; before my mail server goes down again.
