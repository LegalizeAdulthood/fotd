; Fractal visionaries:
;
; Today's fractal is one of those that I just couldn't find a name for.
; It looks like nothing I've seen on this world.  It vaguely resembles a
; neural network, so at first I was going to name it "neural".  Then I
; imagined a scene on an alien planet and decided to call the fractal
; "alien".  In the end I decided to name it "Vicious" because it has a
; certain nastiness about it.
;
; The fractal itself combines several tricks.  First, it is drawn in the
; YW plane, which gives parts of it a tortured, stretched-out appearance.
; Second, it is a combination of the Z^2 and Z^-2 mandeloids, which
; creates the many floating blobs and twisted filaments.  Third, I've
; colored it so that it appears to be illuminated from behind by a lurid
; light.
;
; Combining positive and negative powers of Z in the same formula is one
; of my favorite tricks.  Today's formula, for example, combines Z^2 and
; Z^-2, which fills the Mandelbrot lake with interesting details.  But the
; positive and negative terms cannot simply be added together as
; (Z^2)+(Z^-2).  If they are, the terms tend to cancel out, and nothing
; more than a few bands appear.
;
; To solve this problem and keep the formula under control, I combine
; different portions of the positive and negative terms.  In today's
; fractal, for example, I use the formula, (0.75*(Z^2))+(0.03*(Z^-2)).
; Iterating only 0.75 of Z^2 makes the figure somewhat larger to give more
; inside room, while the 0.03 portion of Z^-2 is just enough to add inside
; detail without clogging the interior.  Tomorrow, I'll post one of the
; many striking straight Mandelbrot images I've found with this method.
;
; For those who prefer their images pre-drawn, today's finished image is
; posted to a.b.p.f. and a.f.p.
