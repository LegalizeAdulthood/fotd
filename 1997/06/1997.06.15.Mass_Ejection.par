; June 15, 1997: Mass Ejection

;
; Fractal visionaries:
; For today's fractal we leave the odd planes and present a fractal that
; is just plain pretty.  After all, that's what fractal art is all about.
; I named the picture "Corona" because it reminds me of an eclipsed sun.
; (I think I have another picture named "Corona" on file -- I'm not sure.)
; The formula takes advantage of the new if-else feature of Fractint
; 19.6.  This formula, which I picked up from this group and added a few
; variables to, draws fractals that are filled with wavy sinuous lines.
; Some of the fractals it draws are remarkably relaxing.  If I hadn't
; gotten distracted by the odd slices formulas I've been preoccupied with
; lately, I would have had some real beauties from this formula.
; But I still am preoccupied by the formulas that draw the odd slices, and
; I'm finding some real beauties in those obscure planes also.  I'll post
; one of my better efforts tomorrow.
; My love for art is battling my love for math.  I want to see what can be
; done with my if-else formula, and at the same time I'm curious about
; what the oh-so-familiar Mandelbrot set looks like when viewed from
; directions that I can't even imagine.
; That's how it is with the world of fractals.  No matter how much one
; explores, they will never scratch the surface of all that exists.
; Today's finished image has been posted to a.b.p.f. and a.f.p. as always.
