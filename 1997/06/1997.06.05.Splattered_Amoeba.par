; Fractal visionaries:
; Today's fractal is one of my TowerExp series, based on the formula
; Z^(-Z+n).  Though the Z^Z formulas usually are filled with
; discontinuities and disconnected fragments, this fractal has very little
; chaos.  It appears as round tubes dividing ever finer as they near the
; limit.  Like so many of my pictures, it appears to be illuminated from
; within by a pale peach-colored light.  This gives it somewhat of a
; three-dimensional effect.
; Much is being said nowadays about three-dimensional fractals, with
; high-tech methods such as ray tracing and PHC being discussed as though
; everyone can actually understand the discussion.  To me, these methods
; are interesting, but I still prefer to achieve my three-dimensional
; effects by carefully chosen coloring.
; My method of coloring is quite simple.  I try various combinations of
; colors, then set the fractal program to slowly flow the colors and sit
; back to watch.  Sometimes it takes longer to find the proper color
; palette than it did to draw the image; at other times I find the right
; colors almost at once.
; Today's picture is a good example.  It took 50 seconds to draw and 13
; minutes for me to find the colors.  Even now, I feel that the colors are
; not the best possible -- but then, colors never are.
; For tomorrow's fractal I hope to have found something worthwhile with a
; formula I just wrote, which uses the new if-else commands in Fractint
; version 19.6.  But that's not a promise, because I've found nothing yet
; worth showing.
