; Fractal visionaries:
;
; Every once in a while there comes a fractal picture that fairly shouts
; its name.  Today's image is one of those.  Despite the abysmal initial
; coloring, the moment I saw the image, with its stylized figure standing
; on a mountain top, showering blessings, I knew it could be named nothing
; but "Blessings to All".  It took only a carefully selected palette to
; bring the prophet to life.
;
; The formula is one of my failed attempts to rotate the julibrot from the
; XY to the XZ plane.  But though the formula doesn't give me exactly what
; I was after, it does draw some very interesting images, which have
; earned it a place in my permanent formula file.
;
; Probably half the formulas in my collection were failures when I first
; tried them.  But success can sometimes come from failure, and unless a
; formula draws nothing but a blank screen, I almost never give up on it
; until I have tried a wide variety of parameters.  My current effort to
; draw all the oblique and skew planes in the julibrot figure is producing
; an unusually rich variety of formulas and images.
;
; For tomorrow's fractal, I'm going to wing it.  Maybe I'll post another
; of my lucky accident fractals; maybe one of my older gems.  But whatever
; it turns out to be, it will be interesting.  Today's image has been
; solemnly posted to a.b.p.f. and a.f.p. for the convenience of those who
; can't tie up their machines.
