; Fractal visionaries:
; Fractals are almost magical in the way they can create so much beauty
; from so little information.  How is it possible that a formula as simple
; as Z^2+C can hold within itself the infinity of information contained in
; the Mandelbrot set?  Are mystical forces actually involved?
; The answer, of course, is that the formula is not the carrier of the
; infinitely detailed Mandelbrot set, but merely a set of directions
; telling us which way to go to build the set and reveal for ourselves the
; potential riches that are always waiting there.
; The Mandelbrot set never runs out of surprises.  It is part of a larger
; object, the four-dimensional Julibrot figure, which I am currently
; exploring.  Just as the Mandelbrot sets and the Julia sets each have
; their distinctive, easily recognizable characteristics, as well as their
; similarities, the XZ, XW, YZ, and YW sets each have their own
; distinctive characteristics as well as their similarities.
; Today, and every day for the rest of this week, I will concentrate on
; the YZ direction by posting images sliced in that direction.  Then I'll
; devote a week to images from each of the other three slices.  This does
; not imply, however, that the quality of the images will be compromised.
; The other slices are every bit as rich as the Julia and Mandelbrot
; slices.
; Today's fractal is a picture of a midget -- not a Mandelbrot midget, nor
; a Julia midget, but a YZ midget.  The midgets in this plane have
; characteristics a bit closer to the Julia plane than the Mandelbrot
; plane, though not close enough to be mistaken for a Julia set.  The
; feeling of great forces at work stretching the shapes like cosmic
; rubber, so evident in today's fractal, is a feature that characterizes
; the entire YZ world.
; The finished image has been hopefully posted to a.b.p.f. and a.f.p.  I
; say hopefully because I've had a couple images vanish recently.
