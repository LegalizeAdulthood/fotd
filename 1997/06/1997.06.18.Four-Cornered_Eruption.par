; June 18, 1997: Four-Cornered Eruption
;
; fourcornered
;
; Fractal visionaries:
;
; I named today's fractal pinwheel because there are two versions of it.
; In the version I have attached, the rays are beaming straight out from
; the corners.  But in another version the rays spiral out from the
; corners, giving the entire figure the appearance of a pyrotechnic
; pinwheel.
;
; The formula combines negative exponents, positive exponents and positive
; and negative imaginary exponents into a design that looks quite
; ceremonial, and holds together surprisingly well.
;
; I have been asked how I color my images.  The best answer I can give is
; that I really don't know.  I've studied landscape painting, and that
; seems to help.  But a fractal is an entirely new thing that needs new
; rules.  Most often, I simply noodle around until I find the color
; bandwidth that seems to work best, then, when I've found colors that
; work reasonably well, I fine tune the palette, sometimes hand adjusting
; all 256 colors.  I've saved the color map files of most of my better
; fractals, but I've found that a palette that works great on one picture
; often doesn't work at all on the next picture.
;
; The four-dimensional animation ideas that are being discussed are quite
; interesting.  I've been thinking so much about the 4-D Julibrot figure
; lately, that in a vague sort of way I can almost see the entire
; monstrous object with its many buds and tendrils.  An animation would
; make the monster even more real.  But I'm still working on finding
; formulas that will draw all those unimaginably skewed slices.
