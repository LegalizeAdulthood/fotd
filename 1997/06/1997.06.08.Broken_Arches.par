; June 8, 1997: Broken Arches

; Fractal visionaries:
; As promised, todays fractal, which I named "Arches", is another view of
; Seahorse Valley.  But whereas yesterday's image showed Seahorse Valley
; as it might be viewed from the X-axis, at the left edge of the screen,
; today's image shows the valley as it might be viewed from the top of the
; screen on the Y-axis.  In both cases, the Mandelbrot set must be
; imagined as a three-dimensional object existing in space on both sides
; of the screen.
; But one might ask, "where in the picture is the Seahorse Valley?  I see
; nothing but a few arches."  Look again at the picture, notice the
; straight horizontal ribbon of chaos toward the top of the screen.  That
; straight band is Seahorse Valley.  Viewed from this angle, it's totally
; unrecognizable.  Even more unrecognizable is the valley at -1.25.
; That's it -- that straight-edged band of chaos nearly buried in the
; rubble toward the bottom of the screen.
; The odd slices of the Julibrot figure are filled with perfectly straight
; bands of high-iteration chaos such as those in today's fractal.  When I
; first saw these bands, I thought the formula wasn't working.  But the
; bands are real features, since they correspond to features in the
; classic M-set.
; Before I go, I must thank Benno Schmid for those 4-D formulas he sent a
; couple days ago.  They gave me just the hints I needed.  I had been
; struggling with similar formulas for several months, but I just couldn't
; get them right until I saw how Benno had solved the same problem.  After
; I made a few minor corrections in my formulas, they worked perfectly.
; For tomorrow, we'll leave the world of four dimensions and return to the
; familiar and easy to comprehend world of the two dimensional screen.
; I've got a good fractal waiting to be posted.
