; Fractal visionaries:
; I've read complaints lately about too much technology and not enough art
; in fractal-art.  The technological aspect of fractals does seem to have
; been discussed rather heavily the past week or so, but let us not forget
; that without technology there would be no fractal art.  Computers and
; fractal programs are the instruments through which we render our
; fledgling art.  To ask us to avoid discussing our instruments would be
; like asking musicians to avoid discussing their instruments.  It's just
; not going to happen.  Tim Wegner must feel the same because I see he's
; just unsubscribed.
; What we need is that second mailing list I hear rumors of, devoted to
; the fringe topics of fractals, where we can discuss things such as math
; theory, Fractint, and even the philosophical aspects of fractals.
; That out of the way, let's get to today's fractal.  I scribbled off the
; formula only this morning, and this stormy little midget, a cousin of
; bigblast, was the first to come from it.  I can hear the sighs now, "not
; another midget mandelbrot", but this one draws in only a few minutes,
; and really is pretty good, especially when it is viewed in relatively
; low light.
; I've posted the finished picture as always to a.b.p.f., and also to
; alt.fractals.pictures, which I picked up.  Until next time then, good
; viewing.
