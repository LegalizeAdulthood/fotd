; Fractal visionaries:
; The first thing a fractal explorer discovers is that the inside of the
; fractal lake, where the points are trapped, is a pretty dull place.  You
; just don't go looking there for interesting images.  True, one can add a
; bit of color by searching out finite attractors, but the result is still
; rather dull.
; A while back I decided to see if I could do something about this
; situation.  I wrote a series of experimental formulas called Mystic.
; Mystic1 did little of interest, but Mystic2, attached below, was a real
; winner.  The last line of the formula, g=sqr(g), assures that the
; fractal itself, with the inside set to a solid color, will be nothing
; more than a circle of radius one around the origin.  But there's a lot
; going on beneath the calm surface of that circle.
; Set the inside to bof60 or bof61 and the fractal suddenly comes to
; life.  No longer a solid color, it is filled with intricate fractal
; detail.  The six variable parameters and one variable function give
; variety enough to satisfy any fractal explorer.  In today's picture for
; example, which I named kissfish because it reminded me of kissing fish,
; set the function to floor and watch the resulting explosion.
; In addition to the seven variables, the image can sometimes also be
; changed by changing the maxiter or the periodicity setting.  This,
; however, is something I have not yet investigated.
; These undersea fractals are also interesting in that they are quite
; unpredictable.  Different areas have totally different characteristics.
; Zoom in on the edge of the circular fractal, and you never know what
; surprise awaits there.  A limitation exists in coloring possibilities
; because of the limited number of bands in these pictures, but this can
; be worked around.
; BTW, I think I'm beginning to have second thoughts about longer
; formulas.  When I joined this list, I said that I liked my formulas as
; short and simple as possible.  I rarely included as much as a single
; transcendental function.  But now that I've seen what some of you are
; doing with longer formulas, I'm not sure how I feel.  I guess I'll just
; have to see how my future formula writing efforts develop.
