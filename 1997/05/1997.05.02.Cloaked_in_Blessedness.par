; May 2, 1997: Cloaked in Blessedness 
;
; blessedness
;
; Fractal visionaries:
; Today's fractal again takes advantage of the bof61 inside fill
; feature of Fractint, which colors the points according to their
; closest approach to the origin.  I named it "angel" because it
; looks a little like an angel -- but not too much like one.
; The image demonstrates that as the exponent of Z in a mandeloid
; is made smaller, the action shifts from outside the fractal to
; the inside, where it can be revealed by the fill options.
; The negative Z in the formula rotates the odd order sets 90
; degrees, while leaving the even order sets unchanged.  This
; action completely changes the nature of the fractional order
; sets, and reveals details in the sets of orders just a bit
; greater than one, which are normally no more than tiny oblong
; holes.
; More on these low-order sets in the near future.  The finished
; image is hopefully posted to ABPF.  I say hopefully because
; yesterday's picture didn't make it, causing me to have to repost
; it this afternoon.
