; Fractal visionaries:
; After yesterday's almost shy undersea fractal, today's 7-minute picture
; is a real extrovert, shamelessly showing off its gaudy colors and shapes
; for the whole world to see.  I named it "mosaic" because it reminds me
; of those wonderful old Moorish tilings adorning The Alhambra.  But no
; man ever tiled a floor or wall with a pattern like this.
; The picture is actually part of the Julia set of the Z^-1.667 mandeloid,
; which I'm currently exploring with a formula I've written.  I'm finding
; scenes unlike anything I've seen, and I'll be posting a few in the near
; future.  But for tomorrow, I think I'll share a Newton's fractal.  I
; don't recall having yet posted a single Newton's image.
; I've noticed that the world of fractal formulas is a lot like the world
; of scientific research, where several researchers sometimes
; independently make the same discovery at the same time.  It seems as
; though every time I think I've found some thing new, I see someone who
; has been doing it before.  Fractal formulas sometimes seem to be out
; there ready for discovery, and like America, if one person doesn't
; discover them, another person soon will.
; Today's image as always is posted to a.b.p.f. and a.f.p.  Since it runs
; under the julzpower formula, no formula file is attached.
