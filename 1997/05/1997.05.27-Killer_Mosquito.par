; Fractal visionaries:
;
; I'm following with interest the progress of the collaborative fractal
; montage that we're trying to get going.  But I'm not sure exactly what
; we'll have if and when the thing actually comes to fruition.
;
; When I first read of the plan, I pictured an immense printed image of
; the Mandelbrot set -- an image with a resolution of something like
; 250,000 x 250,000 pixels -- large enough and with enough detail to cover
; a soccer field without losing sharpness.  Such an item, if we could
; overcome the obstacles, would surely be newsworthy, and perhaps raise
; the public awareness of the basically unexplored world of fractal
; geometry.  The higher the public interest in fractals, the easier it
; will be for us to earn some decent money.
;
; And speaking of decency, today's fractal, named Eruption, is a pretty
; decent one, and it's also a pretty good one.  It's made with one of my
; experimental Newton's formulas.  When I first saw it, it reminded me of
; an erupting volcano in Hawaii.  It no longer seems very volcano-like,
; but the name has stuck.  So, for what it's worth, here is my erupting
; volcano.  The draw time is 10 minutes or so.
;
; Tomorrow, we'll go back to the good old Mandelbrot set, and look at an
; old midget from a new angle.
