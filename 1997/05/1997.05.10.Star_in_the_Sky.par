; May 10, 1997: Star in the Sky

; Fractal visionaries:
; I've got Fractint 19.6 up and running, and the good news is that it's a
; little faster, (on my machine at least), than 19.5.  I'm glad to see
; that the slow-down trend, which has been building since version 19.2,
; has been reversed.  In addition to the usual formula and parameter
; files, I've attached today's fractal as a parameter file with formula
; included for those running version 19.6.  If I've done my part right,
; simply snip it, save it as *.par, (* = any name you wish), and run it.
; As for the picture itself, since yesterday's fractal had a demonic
; appearance and took 2 hours to draw, I felt it only proper that today's,
; which I have named "vision", should have a sacred appearance and draw in
; less than a minute. Actually it draws in 20 seconds.
; I'm showing no favoritism in my choice of symbols.  I used the six-sided
; star because it gives such a symmetrical fractal.  Change p1 to 6, p3 to
; -4 and the symmetry to xaxis, and you'll get a five-sided star.  But the
; five-sided star is lopsided.
; With this formula, p1 controls the number of lobes on the outer rim, p2,
; which must be kept small, controls the size of the inside star, and p3
; controls the number of lobes on the inside star.
