; May 13, 1997: Scene on Mars

; Fractal visionaries:
; Fractals are everywhere -- in the woods as ferns, in the garden as
; cauliflower and broccoli, in the ocean as waves and coral, in the sky as
; clouds, even in outer space.  If anyone doubts this, I would recommend
; that they check today's fractal, which comes straight from the planet
; Mars.  The illustrated landscape is about as close as one can come to
; standing on the surface of Mars without actually traveling there.  I
; found it a few years ago while running Fractint version 18.21, which I
; believe came with the second edition of "Fractal Creations" by Tim
; Wegner etal.  (BTW, the book is a veritable encyclopedia of information
; about Fractint and fractals in general.  If anyone comes upon a copy, I
; would recommend grabbing it before it vanishes.)
; The attached parameter file runs under the manzpower formula of
; fractint, so no formula file is included.  The fractal itself is from an
; area along the negative X-axis of the Z^3.25 mandeloid.  When I began
; exploring the fractional order mandeloids, I was annoyed by the discon
; tinuities that fill these fractals.  But then I stopped fighting the
; breaks and began taking advantage of them.  Today's image is nothing
; more than one big mass of discon tinuities colored to resemble a thin,
; dusty atmosphere, and a landscape littered with well oxidized rocks.
; It's too bad that I have so far been unable to find those ancient
; abandoned cities that Ray Bradbury described as scattered about the
; surface of Mars, but I'm still looking.
