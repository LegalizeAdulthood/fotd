; Fractal visionaries:
; Today's formula is a really strange one.  One minute it's drawing the
; classic Mandelbrot set, the next minute it's drawing a screen full of
; flying fragments.  I devised the formula in an effort to eliminate the
; break along the negative x-axis that appears when complex or imaginary
; powers are calculated.  I got a lot more than I bargained for.
; I figured that since positive and negative imaginary powers draw
; fractals that spiral around the origin in opposite directions, if an
; expression something like (Z^2i)^(Z^(-2i)) were calculated, the opposite
; signs would cancel the spiraling out, leaving a fractal with the
; features of an imaginary exponent without the discontinuity along the
; x-axis.
; It worked beautifully.  Today's fractal, ringwrld, shows a somewhat
; distorted but still recognizable Mandelbrot set surrounded by rings
; introduced by the imag(1) assigned p3, which is calculated in the
; formula as both positive and negative.
; The formula is full of other surprises.  It's one of the most bizarre
; and unpredictable formulas in my collection, but despite its
; versatility, it still runs fast.  So don't hesitate to change the
; parameters and see what surprises you can turn up.
