; Fractal visionaries:
; Today's fractal, Aftermath, is a slow one, so it might be best to pick
; up the finished image from a.b.p.f. or alt.fractals.pictures.  Since the
; par file runs under the manzpower formula in Fractint, no new formula is
; attached.  The picture shows a stressed out and distorted little midget
; in the Z^1.455 mandeloid, surrounded by fragments of shapes the greater
; part of which have gone off the screen into some vague imaginary world.
; All fractional order mandeloids, as well as many other fractals, have
; these discontinuities, which I call slip planes.  They remind me of
; earthly fault lines.  The discontinuities are a result of the
; multi-valued nature of the complex log functions, and cannot be
; eliminated.
; Unlike yesterday's fractal, this one received several hours of coloring
; time, and the effort shows.  On my monitor the larger fragments almost
; leap off the screen.
; Sometimes I am asked what part the artist plays in the field of fractal
; art.  This picture is a good example of the artist's part.  Give the
; picture a random coloring scheme; watch how fast the three-dimensional
; effect vanishes, and how difficult it is to bring back.  Trying to bring
; flat two-dimensional fractals to a solid three-dimensional reality, as I
; did with this one, is the approach I usually adopt as I work with
; colors.  I often spend more time coloring a good fractal than I spent
; waiting for it to draw.
; Tomorrow, I'm going to post a different kind of fractal -- a fractal
; from an area not too widely explored.  It will be one of those I call
; undersea fractals because they exist entirely in the "lake" area of
; trapped points.  I have several formulas that draw nothing outside the
; lake area, but show unexpected fractal detail within the lake when the
; lake is colored in some manner.  Some of this detail is of an entirely
; new character. Until then . . .
