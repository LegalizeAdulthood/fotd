; May 12, 1997: Seven Magnificent Minibrots

; Fractal visionaries:
;
; Over the past 7 years, I have probably written and deleted thousands of
; formulas.  Most of these were discarded because they produced either a
; blank screen or duplicated figures that were more easily drawn with
; simpler formulas.  Only a few survived to find a permanent home in my
; formula file.  Today's formula, Test15, is one of the survivors.  I've
; yet to get around to naming it.
;
; I thought of the formula today because I've been reading lately of
; formulas that draw multiple midgets in a circle.  One thing today's
; formula does, among many others, is to draw any number of midgets of any
; order, facing either in or out, in a circle around the origin.  Today's
; picture, seven_up, shows seven midgets of order two, arranged in a
; circle facing outward.  To have them face inward, change the +0.35
; assigned real p2 to -0.35.
;
; I'll leave it to the intrepid fractal explorers to discover how to
; change the number of midgets, or how to change their shape to midgets of
; a different order.  I'll give only the caution that it's easy to get
; hopelessly lost.  But even if you get lost, you'll see some strange
; sights.
;
; It's a tricky process involving several parameters that must be changed
; and coordinated at the same time.  (OK, if anyone really wants to know,
; I'll send the method along, but be warned that the description of the
; method is mathematically convoluted and will make rather tedious
; reading.)
;
; To atone for today's fractal, which is much math and little art, I'll
; post a great piece of fractal art tomorrow.
