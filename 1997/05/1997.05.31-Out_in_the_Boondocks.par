; May 31, 1997: Out in the Boondocks

; Fractal visionaries:
;
; I don't recall having yet posted a really deep fractal.  The reason is
; that I do little exploration in the ultra-deep areas.  I avoid these
; areas for two reasons -- first: the obvious reason that it's too slow,
; second: I find it gets a bit dull and monotonous down there.
;
; True, the thought is awesome when one realizes that the scene they are
; looking at is part of an object many times the size of the known
; universe, but in my experience, when the awe rubs off, a certain
; sameness starts creeping in.  Today's fractal, sunburst, at a relatively
; conservative magnitude of 10^28, (ten-octillion), is a typical example.
;
; At first glance the image is striking, with its radiating arms of solar
; energy, but notice the circular nature of the surrounding pattern.  This
; tendency for the features around midgets to become so intricate that
; they blend together into circular bands of colors is perhaps the
; greatest disappointment when one goes deep into a Mandelbrot fractal.
;
; Another problem, especially with the straight-rayed midgets along the
; negative x-axis of the Mandelbrot set, is with moire patterns.  These
; annoying artifacts appear when the magnitude nears 10^50, and grow
; progressively worse the deeper one goes.  At a magnitude of 10^500, the
; screen becomes one big moire pattern even before the x-axis midget
; becomes visible.
;
; As long as the escape-time bands are used to define coloring, these
; problems appear insolvable.  Perhaps other coloring methods, such as
; those currently being discussed in connection with true color, could
; avoid such problems.  I'm eagerly waiting to see where we go from here.
; Other types of fractals, such as Newton's, might not be plagued by these
; problems, but I've explored beyond 10^14 or so only in the
; Mandelbrot-Julia family of fractals.  So I can say nothing about this.
;
; Since today's fractal runs under the Fractint Mandelbrot formula, only
; the parameter file is attached.  As always, the finished image is posted
; to a.b.p.f. and a.f.p.  Tomorrow, I'll return to one of those ridiculous
; but fun test formulas I've got stored away, and see what kind of
; outlandish fractal I can come up with.
