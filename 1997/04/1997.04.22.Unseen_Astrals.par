; Fractal visionaries:
; Here is the formula and parameter file of my latest fractal of the day.
; I have also posted the finished image to ABPF for those of you who have
; been requesting that I do so.  The subject of the ABPF posting is
; "Fractal of the day, 22-04", the same as the subject of this posting.  I
; really should have been doing this all along. When my web page is up and
; running in a few months, I'll post my best images there also.
; I found today's fractal formula more or less by lucky accident while
; noodling around with random numbers. To get the full feeling of the
; picture, imagine yourself an intrepid explorer of an alien world.  You
; have just landed deep in an ancient crater and are climbing to the rim.
; Gradually, the sky is coming into view.  Suddenly, you see above the rim
; these unearthly shapes, streams of energies flowing from nowhere to
; nowhere.  What does it mean?
; You'll never know!
; As is apparent by this time, I am a surrealist. I suppose many fractal
; artists are. I love those vast empty landscapes, but more the peaceful
; yet mysterious ones of Yves Tanguy than the sensationalized ones of
; Dali.
; Are fractals mere mappings of reiterated formulas -- yes!  Are they
; works of art -- yes!  They are works of art because their creators
; declare them to be so.  If an object owes its existence to a human
; being, and if at least one person finds pleasure in it, then that object
; is art.  The very concept of art is a human invention; the very fact
; that people are debating whether fractals are or are not art, makes them
; art.
; Everything in the universe is a work of art; indeed, the universe itself
; is the grandest artwork of all.  If anyone still doubts that fractals
; are art, let him show that non-art exists. Let him present one object
; that could not in some way be appreciated as art.
