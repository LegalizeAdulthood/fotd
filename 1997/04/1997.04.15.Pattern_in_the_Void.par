; April 15, 1997: Pattern in the Void

; Fractal visionaries:
; I just drew a couple of those pseudo-true-color, overlapping fractals.
; What else can I say but, "Wow! they're great!"  But I still prefer my
; formulas simple -- the simpler the better. Attached below is a simple
; Julia formula and par file that takes advantage of the bof60 inside
; coloring option of Fractint. The few minutes it takes to draw it will be
; well worth the effort.
; I have always been fascinated by the way "real" world patterns keep
; turning up in various fractals.  I have seen trees, ferns, ice floes,
; among many other patterns.  But the pattern of the attached fractal is
; something entirely new, which has no immediate counterpart in the "real"
; world.  (I enclose "real" in quotes because after 10 years of working
; with fractals I'm beginning to think like Mr. Pickover, and question
; exactly what it means to "exist" and "be real".)
; The formula itself is a specialized instance of my JulibrotInvZ formula,
; which I posted previously.  It's curious that as the power of (-Z) gets
; smaller and the outer shape grow simpler, the interior grows more
; complex.
; My interest in fractals is somewhat specialized. Although I have the
; means of producing high-definition fractal posters, I don't seem to be
; able to work up enough interest to exert the effort.  I enjoy the search
; and discovery aspect of fractal geometry, seeking new twists in old
; formulas.  The day after I find another "great one", my enthusiasm for
; that particular fractal has exhausted itself.  I file the image away
; never to look at it again, and go searching for the next great one.
; It's satisfying to know that I'll never run out of places to search.
