; Fractal visionaries:
;
; Fractals are things of many mysteries.  They raise one question after
; another.  During the ten years I've been working with them, these
; questions have almost constantly been in my mind.
; Perhaps the most immediate question is: how can an infinity of detail be
; encoded in such a simple formula?
;
; This question is relatively easy to answer.  The answer lies in the
; recursive nature of the fractal formula.  The fractal formula as written
; does not contain infinite detail, but the formula tells which way to go
; to see the infinite detail that is waiting there.
;
; Reiterating the Mandelbrot formula is like motoring along a highway.
; The instruction to reiterate the formula Z^2+C for every point of the
; complex plane is the same as the instruction to start at Atlantic City,
; keep traveling west on Route 40, and observe the sights as you go.
; Everyone who follows the same simple fractal instructions will see the
; same glorious fractal scenery for the same reason that everyone who
; follows the same simple highway directions will see the same glorious
; real world scenery.
;
; A more difficult question is: what are fractals -- did they exist before
; computers were invented?
;
; The simplest answer to this question is that fractals are infinitely
; complex images which appear on computer screens when complex formulas
; are reiterated and mapped to the complex plane. Since such images
; obviously did not exist before computers, it could be said that fractals
; did not exist before computers.
;
; But a fractal is not a mere physical image on a computer screen, it is a
; mathematical abstraction, an archetype with no more physical existence
; than the naked number seven without seven objects of some kind to give
; it reality.  Since fractal arche types have no real physical existence,
; it is meaningless to speak of a time before computers, when fractal
; archetypes had even less existence.  The fractal archetypes always
; existed in a kind of virtual state, even as they do now.  We simply were
; unaware of them before computers, because we lacked the means to
; manifest them.
;
; There are even more curious aspects to fractals.  Behind the world of
; fractal images lies the ultimate reality of mathematical formulas.  When
; no one is looking, nothing is there but the fractal formulas.  Behind
; the world of everyday objects lies the ultimate reality of the quantum
; world -- a world of incredibly complex mathematical formulas.  Quantum
; theorists tell us that when no one is looking, nothing is there but the
; quantum formulas.  What does this curious similarity imply?  Could the
; world of everyday objects also be a mere image?
;
; Unfortunately, for now this mystical question must remain unanswered,
; for I'm still pondering it.  Meanwhile, it's time to get to today's
; fractal.
;
; I named the formula and picture Gamut because they covers such a wide
; range of effects.  With six variable parameters to tweak, one could
; spend years before they discovered all this formula can do.  The formula
; is a bit more complex than I prefer, but it creates such unusual
; pictures that it's worth it.  As always, the finished image is posted to
; ABPF for those who prefer not to tie up their machines.  For those who
; wish to watch the picture come to life on their screens, it takes XXXX
; to build on a 486-100mhz.
