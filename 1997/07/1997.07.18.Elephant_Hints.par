; Fractal visionaries:
; Yesterday, I said that I would post something never before seen as
; today's fractal.  That's a rather hard promise to keep, but I think that
; I've come a bit close with today's picture.
; The two well-known planes have distinctive features, which become
; familiar with only a small amount of exploring.  The Mandelbrot planes
; have their familiar buds, valleys, stars, spirals, tendrils and of
; course, their midgets.  The Julia planes have everything the M-planes
; have except the midgets.  In addition, the Julia planes have those silly
; looking double spirals with the big noses, and are self-similar all the
; way down, which sometimes makes their exploration a bit dull.
; Until I found today's fractal, I considered the other four sets of
; planes rather dull also.  But I suspected that this couldn't be true,
; because everything of interest that appears in the Mandelbrot and Julia
; planes also appears in the other four sets of planes, but sliced in a
; different direction.
; Today's fractal is named for what it is -- the first interesting and
; unique object I have found in the XW plane.  As would be expected, it
; combines features of the Julia and Mandelbrot planes.  The chains of
; Mandelbrot buds twist around those silly big-nose, pop-eyed features so
; characteristic of Julia sets.  And everything is stretched and distorted
; as is always the case in the odd planes.
; Today's finished image has definitely been posted to a.b.p.f. and
; a.f.p.  I have already seen it there.  Anyone who can't find it on those
; groups has a problem with their news server.  I know that some servers
; are slow at picking up articles.  Sometimes it takes over a day for the
; Fractal of the day headers to appear on the AOL newsgroups list.
; One more thing needs to be discussed.  There is confusion as to which
; axes are the X, Y, Z, and W axes in these odd plane fractals.  I think
; of the Mandelbrot axes as X and Y, and the Julia axes as Z and W, while
; others consider the Julia axes as X and Y and the Mandelbrot axes as Z
; and W.  This situation leads to the confusion.
; But there is never confusion between the planes when the names
; Mandelbrot and Julia are used to describe them -- the names make the
; planes unmistakable.  By giving names such as Julia and Mandelbrot to
; the other four sets of planes, all this confusion could be avoided.  (I
; would suggest the Muth planes for one of the directions, but my humility
; prevents me from doing so. ;-)
; Anyway, while I'm considering names for the four odd sets of planes,
; I'll dump the cat out of the chair and ensconce myself in front of the
; TV to watch one of those great old sci-fi films.  By tomorrow, I'll have
; discovered other interesting scenes in the odd planes, and one of them
; I'll post.
