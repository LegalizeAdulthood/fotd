; July 21, 1997: A Swiss Mandeloid

; Fractal visionaries:
; It has been suggested that I attach the binary GIF files of my fractals
; to my F.O.T.D. postings.  I have just re-read the Fractal-Art charter,
; and it says absolutely no binaries.  If I began posting binaries, Jon
; would likely hang me, shoot me, behead me, draw and quarter me -- and
; then get nasty.
; The problem is that binaries, when UUE encoded, soak up far too much
; bandwidth.  They can easily run over 1mb in size.  And Aros.net does not
; seem to be the most up-to-date, state-of-the-art ISP.  They're having
; trouble keeping track of the small text files that are posted to this
; group.  If they were flooded with multi-megabytes of fractal images,
; they'd probably dry up and blow away.
; But although I doubt if I could post GIF's to the group, I'd be willing
; to E-mail them individually to a reasonable number of people who request
; them and can't pick them up anywhere else.  The images are not
; copyrighted, not yet at least.  But I'm seriously considering gathering
; the continuing F.O.T.D. writings into a book about the world of fractals
; and fractal art.
; Now on to today's fractal.  As promised yesterday, it is a scene in the
; Z^2+(0.2*Z^3) mandeloid.  This fractal is unusual not only in the number
; of bays and the variety of features, but also in that the image of its
; true XY plane is perfectly mirrored in the perturbed XY plane with a
; starting point of 3.70371+0i.
; We're all familiar with Mandelbrot midgets.  They're lurking
; everywhere.  I suspect that every point of the X-axis from 0.25 to -2.0
; would prove to be in the interior of a midget if only we could search
; deeply enough.  Today's midget turned up when I added 20 percent of the
; Z^3 M-set to the Z^2 set.
; I named the picture "Holey" because it's filled with holes.  The midget
; is floating in a sea of Julia-like holes, in fact, it's riddled through
; and through with holes.  There are some very interesting images in the
; Seahorse Valley area, is anyone wishes to search for them.  At this
; time, I'm too busy with the julibrot odd planes to do much exploring of
; this very unusual scene.
; Today's finished image has been posted to a.b.p.f. and a.f.p. for those
; who can pick it up there.  Tomorrow, I'll return to the julibrot odd
; planes, where I've got a surprise or two waiting.
