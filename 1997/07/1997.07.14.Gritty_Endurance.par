; Fractal visionaries:
; I often ponder such deep questions as, "what is the best Mandelbrot set
; I've ever produced."  A definitive answer might not exist, but today's
; surprising little midget is high on the list.  I've posted it as a
; reward for those few who took the trouble to draw the six views of the
; same lost, misshapen midget that I posted yesterday.
; I've always had problems with Newton's method formulas.  I just can't
; seem to get them right.  Today's fractal is a good example.  I was after
; a Newton's image; I got a Mandelbrot set instead.  But the Mandelbrot
; set is so unusual that I still have the formula in my permanent file.
; The gravelly texture that fills the image is due to the extremely small
; cutoff value of |a|.  Although the color palette in the attached par
; file does not show it very clearly, the gravelly texture, which appears
; to be infinitely divisible, gives a fair appearance of a PHC image,
; especially when drawn at a high resolution.  Experiment with the colors
; a bit; you'll be surprised at the effects that are possible.
; Unlike yesterday's six unfortunate images, today's image has been
; successfully posted to Usenet, where it hangs on a.b.p.f. and a.f.p.  I
; have decided not to post yesterday's images to the binaries groups.  A
; second look convinced me that they are not worth the bandwidth.
; For tomorrow's fractal, I'll return to those weird julibrot planes I'm
; fascinated with.  Until then, stay cool or keep warm, depending on which
; hemisphere you're living in.
