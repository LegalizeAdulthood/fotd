; Fractal visionaries:
;
; What is the most reliable medium for long-term storage of digital data?
; In other words, where does one store those glorious fractals with the
; assurance that they will still be there in five or ten years?
; I'm no longer so certain.
;
; I have just tried to recover about 350 old images that I thought were
; safely stored away on a SyQuest 88mb cartridge.  I had intended on
; recoloring them and bringing them up to my present standards, but when I
; tried to read the cartridge, I discovered that the fractals had
; vanished.  I even tried the cartridge in three other drives.  No luck.
; The cartridge had lost its format; the pictures were gone.
;
; I am not totally out of luck, however, because I still have two copies
; of the parameter files safely stored away on good old (sometimes)
; reliable 1.44mb floppy disks.  Of course, this means a couple hundred
; hours of redraw time, but eventually I'll have the original fractals
; once again in my possession.
;
; The reason for the disappearance of the fractals will likely never be
; known for certain, but I have a pretty good idea what happened.  The
; cartridge was stored on a shelf located about one foot, through a wall,
; from a television antenna ground wire.  I believe that the antenna was
; struck by lightning recently, and I suspect that the magnetic field
; associated with the surge of the discharge through the ground wire was
; so strong that it damaged the cartridge.  The fact that several blank
; but formatted cartridges on the same shelf also have lost their formats
; would lend credence to my suspicion.  So don't store your digital data
; near lightning rods.
;
; (Five-thousand years ago, the Egyptians had an archiving technology that
; has lasted until this day, and may last five-thousand years more.  They
; carved their data in stone.  Today, we can't even preserve data for five
; years.  This is some progress.  Of course, we have much more data than
; the Egyptians ever dreamed of, but perhaps that is part of the problem.)
; :-)
;
; I remember seeing a thread in this group a few weeks ago about the most
; reliable long-term storage medium -- something about a medium immune to
; magnetic disruption.  I've still got those letters filed away, so when I
; finish here, I'll see what I can turn up.
;
; Now it's time for today's fractal -- a different type of image.  This
; one is notable in that it consists entirely of trapped points.  If the
; inside fill were set to 0, the result would be a blank screen.  The
; fractal itself is the inside of a Julia set that just misses an area of
; chaos, but comes close enough for the nearby chaos to do strange things
; to the blank interior -- things which the proper fill option can reveal.
;
; Those with a bit of idle time might try different fill options -- they
; all give interesting results.  Changing the maxiter and/or the
; periodicity also changes the image.  Of course, the finished product has
; been posted to a.b.p.f. and a.f.p.
;
; Tomorrow, perhaps I'll get back to those way-out oblique planes.  We'll
; see when the time comes.
