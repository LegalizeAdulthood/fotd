; July 29, 1997: Indigo Forest Scene

; Fractal visionaries:
; Today's FOTD should be called yesterday's FOTD, because I'm that late
; posting it.  It would have been on time but for the telephone, which
; stopped working yesterday evening.  But the telephone company has come
; to the rescue and fixed the telephone, and everything is now working
; again.
; The fractal is named "Forest".  It's one of those frequently appearing
; images that reminds me of a scene looking through the trees of a magical
; fairyland forest.  The scene is in the same area of almost the same
; mandeloid as the "Squared" fractal, but sliced in the YZ direction.
; This area of this particular mandeloid is very rich in undiscovered
; treasures.  I'll probably be several more days digging around here at
; various angles, seeing what goodies I can find.  For tomorrow, I well
; might post one of those treasures.
; Although today's finished image has not yet been posted to the two
; fractal Usenet groups, it will be posted there as soon as I post this
; message.
