; Fractal visionaries:
; After yesterday's fiasco, where I attached the wrong formula to my
; letter, I feel obliged to post one of my more unusual fractals today.
; So here it is -- a study in fractal textures.
; If there is one single thing that computer generated art all too often
; lacks, it is a natural appearing texture.  This unnatural smoothness is
; frequently the only thing that reveals the computerized origin.  In some
; cases, such as with those all-too-familiar ray-traced metallic spheres,
; this smoothness is desirable, and indeed better than an artist could
; achieve with traditional tools.  But often it gives an appearance of
; artificiality.  IMO, the skillful handling of texture is one sign of
; computer artists' mastery of their profession.
; Today's fractal is loaded with texture -- in fact it's nothing more than
; one big study in textures.  If anything, it has too much texture.
; Almost all of it is bof60 inside fill, which colors the inside according
; to which iteration comes closest to the origin.  It's one of those
; immediately striking pictures that catch the eye at once, but lack
; depth.
; Many of my fractals lack depth, however.  I'm so busy trying out new
; formula ideas that I rarely delve very deeply into any of my images.
; Today's image is posted to a.b.p.f. and a.f.p.  As for tomorrow's
; fractal -- it will be interesting.
