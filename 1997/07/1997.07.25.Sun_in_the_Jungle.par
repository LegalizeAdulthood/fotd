; Fractal visionaries:
; Last evening I dreamed I was holding in my hand a four-dimensional
; hypercube, actually feeling the impossible shape of the thing.  Then I
; woke up and found that I had fallen asleep while playing with a Rubik's
; cube.  Too bad that after I awoke I couldn't recall how the hypercube
; had appeared.
; Today's fancy little fractal image is named "Foliage".  I named it
; because it reminds me of a scene viewed through a break in the foliage
; of some unimaginably exotic distant land.  Actually it's the fractal
; that results when the formula Z^(-Z^(Z+2)) is iterated.
; Raising Z to powers of Z usually results in fractured fractals too
; chaotic to be of much interest.  But sometimes quite interesting images
; result, as demonstrated by today's fractal.
; Today's finished image, a rather large file, has been posted to
; alt.binaries.pictures.fractals and alt.fractals.pictures.  I can't
; understand why so many are having trouble retrieving the images from
; those Usenet groups.  I checked earlier today and found that every image
; I had posted over the past two weeks was still available there, through
; both my Mindspring and AOL ISP's.  I suspect that because of the size of
; the files and the number of porno postings some news servers don't carry
; the binary groups.  I think Deja News cancels binary postings.
; Tomorrow, unless I turn up a really great fractal somewhere else, I'll
; return to the julibrot.  There's no end of surprises to be had simply by
; getting a new perspective on an old object.
