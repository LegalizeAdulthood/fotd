; July 15, 1997: Pinhead

; Fractal visionaries:
; Today's fractal was drawn with a formula still in the testing stage.  I
; usually don't like to draw finished images from formulas still in
; development, because then I must keep a copy of the unfinished formula
; on file so that the fractal does not become an orphan without a formula.
; But except for the drawing of the parallel planes, which still doesn't
; work as I'd like, this version of the formula works pretty well, and it
; makes some very striking images, so I decided to go ahead and use it.
; The fractal shows a midget on the negative tail of the classic
; Mandelbrot set, sliced at an angle rotated 55 degrees toward the YZ
; plane.  The midgets on the negative tail are shaped like long, hollow
; tubes in the Z dimension.  This is why the oblique slice stretches the
; midget horizontally.
; Since the midget's main bud has become scrunched into a narrow funnel, I
; named the picture "Pinhead".  The finished image is waiting on a.b.p.f.
; and a.f.p. for those who would rather pick it up that way.
; Tomorrow, I'll go for a fractal that's more art than theory.  But before
; I go, let me make one comment on "Jazzy on the Outside", a fractal which
; was posted by Les St Clair earlier today.  My one comment is, "wow! how
; do they do that stuff!"
