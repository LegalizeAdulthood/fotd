; July 6, 1997: Obscured Blue Bud

; Fractal visionaries:
;
; Today's fractal is a scene in one of the "perturbed" Mandelbrot planes.
; This scene is parallel to the classic Mandelbrot set but off to one side
; of it.  It shows a bud, (or radical as Mandelbrot calls them), nearly
; buried but still clearly visible through a foreground haze of low
; iteration clutter.
;
; I was truly amazed when I discovered that these elusive ghost buds exist
; in the background of many routine perturbed scenes, ready to be revealed
; by a high maxiter and proper coloring -- almost as though the
; low-iteration and high-iteration ranges were doing entirely different
; things.
;
; These perturbed remnants of the classic M-set are always found at the
; same coordinates at which they are found in the classic set.  If the
; perturbed scene is not obscured by low iteration clutter, a ghostly
; remnant of the true set will always be present in the high-iteration
; range, and this remnant remains fixed in place regardless of the
; starting point of the perturbed set in which it appears.
;
; The fact that these high-iteration remnants remain fixed in position
; through a wide range of starting points is the reason that the
; horizontal high-iteration bands appear in the XZ, XW, YZ and YW planes.
; Those horizontal bands are parts of the classic set viewed at a right
; angle.  Their straightness indicates that they do not move when the
; starting point is changed.
;
; The picture itself is an attempt to capture a feeling of illumination
; from within, as though a source of light were just off the screen.  It
; is only moderately effective due to the limitation of the banding and
; the 256 colors.  When true color arrives, this effect will be much
; easier to achieve.
;
; Today's image is posted on alt.binaries.pictures.fractals and
; alt.fractals.pictures.  Tomorrow is Monday.  That means back to work and
; a new and better fractal.  Keep posted.
