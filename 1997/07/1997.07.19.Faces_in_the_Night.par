; Fractal visionaries:
; Today's rather ominous fractal is a scene in some remote oblique or skew
; plane of the julibrot.  I'm not sure of its orientation because I'm
; still trying to master this perhaps too ambitious formula of mine.
; When I began my Fractal of the day series, it was with the intention of
; showing what could be done with simple 3-line formulas, but now I see
; that my formulas are starting to look suspiciously like those long,
; complex formulas which I originally put down.
; Today's formula is not quite as complex as it seems, however.  It has
; some awkward expressions that could be made simpler, but I'm having so
; much fun working with it that I just haven't gotten around to tightening
; it up.
; The picture is part of the Z^2+(0.005*Z^-3) julibrot.  Adding such a
; tiny portion of the -3 power of Z to the iteration fills the interior of
; the figure with chaotic detail.  Taking the odd planes stretches the
; inner detail out into tortured threads such as we see in today's
; picture.
; When I saw the image, I pictured a ghost rising from the depths, so I
; named the picture "Wraith".  The complete image has been posted to
; alt.binaries.pictures.fractals and alt.fractals.pictures, though since
; the image draws in only 3 minutes, it would probably be faster to draw
; it from the parameter file than to wait for it to download.
; Tomorrow, I'll return to the odd planes of the Z^2+(0.2*Z^3) mandeloid.
; In its XY direction, that figure is one of my favorites.  Surprisingly,
; its perturbed planes hold more of interest than its "true" slice.
