; July 31, 1997: Nested Cogwheels

; Fractal visionaries:
; For the month of August I've decided to devote less energy to the
; technical side of fractals and more to the artistic side.  True, the
; four-dimensional julibrot figure with its odd slices is fascinating, but
; an infinity of fractals is waiting to be discovered in the good old
; Mandelbrot and Newton's worlgs.
; I'm certainly not going to abandon my exploration of the julibrot.
; Every time I examine it I find something new and interesting.  I'm
; rather going to try to divide my time evenly between all the various
; classes of fractals.
; Today's fractal is a good start.  The formula is one of my test formulas
; that I wrote a while back and then forgot.  But it's really quite an
; interesting formula, with its tiny portion of opposite signed imaginary
; powers cancelling out the negative X-axis discontinuity.
; I named the picture "Cogwheel" because it reminds me of some fantastic
; train of gears and gear belts.  Look close and you'll find the classic
; Z^2 Mandelbrot figure hiding behind the scene.
; The finished image has been posted to alt.binaries.pictures.fractals and
; alt.fractals.pictures.  For tomorrow, the sky is the limit.  I'm going
; bring up a few more of those old test formulas and see what I can find.
; And as I promised in yesterday's letter, I've decided on descriptive
; names for the four odd slices of the julibrot.  Here they are: they
; describe the appearance of the slices in question through the julibrot
; origin.
; XY = Mandelbrot planes
; ZW = Julia planes
; XZ = Parabolic planes
; XW = Elliptic planes
; YZ = Oblate planes
; YW = Rectangular planes
; When I return to the julibrot figure, I'll be using those names to
; describe the planes I'm referring to.  That way we'll avoid confusion.
