; FOTD -- November 30, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Early in their fractal explorations, beginning fractalists 
; discover that the higher dimensional fractals hold little of 
; interest.  To put it bluntly, the images all look the same.  But 
; to disprove a point, I present today's image, which lies in the 
; very narrow ring of interest at the western edge of the 
; Z^(100)+C Mandeloid.
; 
; The unexpected action was created by calculating the image with 
; the 'exp' function applied to initial C.  This slight addition 
; changed the entire nature of the image.  Instead of a screen 
; filled with similar minibrots, we have an interesting assortment 
; of effects, including a vertical range of resolution, from near 
; perfect at the top to total breakdown at the bottom.  Curiously, 
; though the large scale breakup is quite obvious, the small-scale 
; edges of the breaks are well resolved.
; 
; The lower half of the image in particular has an art-deco 
; feeling about it.  The name "Art-Deco Breakup" refers to this 
; resemblance.  The rating of a 7 is FOTD average.  The 
; calculation time of 1-1/3 minutes is also near average.
; 
; The finished image is online at:

; High-def variations are at:

; 
; The FOTD back images may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A mix of sun and clouds with a temperature of 43F +6C made today 
; the latest in a string of similar days here at Fractal Central.  
; The fractal cats passed the day watching the outside conditions 
; as well as each other.  The humans did a lot less watching and 
; notably more working.  The next FOTD fractal will be posted 
; around December 2.
; 
; Until whenever, take care, and pseudoscientific occultists claim 
; there are higher-dimensional realities they call astral planes.  
; Totally scientific physicists claim there are higher dimensional 
; realities they call parallel alternate universes.  As for me, 
; I'm waiting to see some kind of solid proof that any of these 
; invisible worlds actually exist.  (Of course, by definition they 
; are invisible, so how can anyone find solid proof?)
