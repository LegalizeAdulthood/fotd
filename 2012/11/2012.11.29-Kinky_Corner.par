; FOTD -- November 29, 2012 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The FOTD is currently being posted every other day.  This is due 
; to an unusually busy spell here at FC.  After the holidays, the 
; FOTD will return to its almost-every-day schedule.
; 
; Today's image shows what a person would see surrounding him if 
; he stationed himself at the center of a Julia spiral.  (In this 
; case, the spiral is one of those associated with Seahorse Valley 
; of the Mandelbrot set.)  As he looked around, he would see a 
; wall of rings in all directions.  If his view were unwrapped and 
; projected onto a flat screen, it would appear as today's image, 
; which is part of a periodic larger image.  This larger image is 
; periodic because the 'exp' function shows what he would see if 
; he continued rotating his view indefinitely.
; 
; Don't shuffle the kids away.  The name "Kinky Corner" refers to 
; the small kink in the lower left corner.
; 
; The image has been stretched about three times in the vertical 
; direction to make the straightened-out spiral arms more apparent.
; 
; Since the interest is purely mathematical, I could not give the 
; image a rating.  The question mark indicates the uncertainty.
; 
; Unfortunately for those with limited time, the image is a slow 
; one, taking 11 minutes to finish.  The good news is that the web 
; sites are there to make fractal life easier.
; 
; The image may be viewed without the need to calculate it by 
; visiting the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Variations are posted in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The FOTD back images are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Cloudy periods alternated with sunny periods here at Fractal 
; Central today, while the temperature of 43F +6C was close to 
; normal.  The fractal cats had an average day of it, as did the 
; humans.  The next FOTD will be posted in a day or two.
; 
; Until whenever, take care, and which is more likely to be in two 
; different places at the same time, a Christian saint in a state 
; of bilocation or an electron in its wave aspect?  (Both things 
; are apparently impossible, yet both are claimed to be true.)
