; FOTD -- November 06, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's little oddity lies in the parent fractal that appears 
; when the expression Z^(2.12)+C is iterated at ground level with 
; no function applied.  This parent is shaped like a squashed 
; Mandeloid with a large main bay and a large period-2 bud on the 
; north shore line.  Today's scene lies in a minor valley on the 
; west side of this bud.
; 
; I named the image "Fractal Warming" because of the fiery reds 
; surrounding the central minibrot, and also because of a recent 
; show on TV about the dangers, real or imagined, of 'climate 
; change'.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is near FOTD average.  Some extra effort on 
; the coloring might have raised the rating a point or so.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/3 minutes is well within reason.  A 
; bit of additional time might be saved by viewing the image on 
; one or more of the web sites.
; 
; The image has already been calculated and posted to the official 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; with hi-def variations at:

; 
; The back images are available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A mix of sun and clouds, with a temperature of 45F +7C made 
; today feel quite like November here at Fractal Central.  Fractal 
; cat Nicholas took advantage of the sun when it was shining and 
; his food dish when it was not.  The humans made it through 
; election day without becoming too concerned over who might be 
; the winner.  Regardless of who wins, the next FOTD will be 
; posted in the near future.  Until whenever, take care, and 
; climate change (aka global warming) is real!  It has already 
; begun!  We had better believe it and start preparing!  Do not 
; make the error of thinking we can stop it or even slow it by 
; forcing a few controversial bills through congress or by signing 
; a few emission reduction treaties that are sure to be violated.
