; 
; FOTD -- April 27, 2012 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates a 6, nothing to brag about but still better 
; than the image of two days ago, which rated an even lower 5.  
; Today's image is half-evaporated, with the open inside parts 
; rendered with the inside set to 'bof61'.  "bof61" refers to page 
; 61 of a certain book about fractals, on which the algorithm 
; first appears.  The outside is set to 'imag', which is short for 
; imaginary.
; 
; The half-evaporated state means exactly what it says.  The 
; imaginary(p3) parameter, which sets the bailout radius, is set 
; to 6000.  In fractals with two negative exponents of Z, the 
; outside parts begin to evaporate as the bailout is increased.  
; In today's image the evaporation has progressed about half way.
; 
; The effect of all this manipulating is today's image, a very 
; sandy one indeed, far too busy for an exceptional rating, yet 
; with enough interest, at least IMO, to be declared FOTD for the 
; day.
; 
; The name "The Pigeon Drop" has nothing to do with the image, nor 
; with the mess pigeons leave behind.  It's the name given to an 
; old scam in which gullible victims would be tricked into turning 
; over their money to the scammer, expecting a quick profit in 
; return.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/4 minutes is a minor scam.  The 
; image is not really worth it.  But those who do not take time to 
; calculate the image will never know what they have missed.  
; Luckily however, there is a way out of the dilemma at the web 
; sites.
; 
; The calculation may be avoided by viewing the finished image on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition version is available at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The past images are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Heavy clouds and a temperature of 50F 10C made today feel more 
; like November than late in April.  The fractal cats wanted more 
; sun but settled for more tuna.  The humans spent the day doing 
; routine business.  The next FOTD is due to be posted in 24 
; hours, but things have been unpredictable here lately so don't 
; be surprised if it is late.  Until whenever, take care, and the 
; great breakthrough is coming.  But who knows where we will go 
; from here.
