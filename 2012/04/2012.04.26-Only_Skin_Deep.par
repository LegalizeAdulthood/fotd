; FOTD -- April 25, 2012 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I seem to have developed a case of fractalist's block, which 
; sometimes strikes fractalists just as writer's block strikes 
; writers.  Fractals that normally might appear pretty good now 
; appear totally worthless.  Like writers, the cure is to work 
; through the block until a better state of mind makes things seem 
; better.
; 
; Today's image is a fully evaporated one that consists totally of 
; inside stuff, the outside parts having totally evaporated away 
; to nothing.  The inside stuff has been made visible by being 
; rendered with the inside set to bof61.
; 
; The parent fractal came about when I combined 3 negative parts 
; of Z^(-1.618) with 0.8 negative part of Z^(-8.8) then added 
; (1/C) on each iteration.  This parent resembles a peanut with a 
; short stubby tail and two rabbit-like ears.  Today's image lies 
; in the valley between the ears.
; 
; There is a large Mandelbrot set well east of the main part of 
; the parent, but this does not figure in today's image. 
; 
; The rating of a 5 might be unfairly low, but my fractalist's 
; block, makes everything I turn out seem worthless.
; 
; The name "Only Skin Deep" has no relation to the image.  It is 
; simply something I wrote when the time came to write something.
; 
; The calculation time of 4-3/4 minutes is too high a price for 
; the result.
; 
; The image is posted, fully calculated, at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high definition rendering is available at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; All the past FOTD images are filed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day actually turned out rather pleasant here at Fractal 
; Central, with partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 61F 16C.  
; The fractal cats had better things to do than worry about the 
; weather, such as meowing for extra tuna.  The humans simply made 
; it through the day, which sounds simple but is sometimes far 
; more difficult than it appears.  The next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and watch that next dream.  It 
; might be a doozy.
