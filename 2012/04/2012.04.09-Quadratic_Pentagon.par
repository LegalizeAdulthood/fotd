; FOTD -- April 09, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in an oversized Mandelbrot set with quintic 
; corruption in its depths.  The location is on the northeast 
; shore line of the large period-2 bud, near the beginning of 
; Seahorse Valley.
; 
; I have been discussing such mixed-exponent images with corrupted 
; depths so fully in recent FOTD's that there is little left to 
; say about them, but whenever I find something I consider worthy 
; of mention, I'll report it in the discussion.
; 
; The name "Quadratic Pentagon" refers to the quintic corruption, 
; which shows itself spectacularly in today's image in both the 
; number of elements surrounding the central minibrot and in the 
; minibrot itself, which is fully quintic.
; 
; The rating of an 8 shows my satisfaction with the image, and 
; also my satisfaction with the signs that we might be pulling out 
; of the latest fractal drought.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes will pass quickly.  
; Checking the image on one of the web sites will be equally quick 
; and a bit more fun.
; 
; The image is posted on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; fully rendered and ready to be enjoyed.
; 
; The high-definition version is at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The entire FOTD history is online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A sunny morning here at Fractal Central gave way to an afternoon 
; of wind-blown clouds.  The temperature of 59F 15C felt much 
; colder due to the winds.  The fractal cats spent much of the day 
; in the north window, watching for unwanted cats to pass by.  As 
; far as we were aware, none ever did.  The day of the humans was 
; occupied with work, tax stuff, and wondering who decides what 
; will make news on the national news channels.
; 
; If all goes well, and even if it does not, the next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and why are people 
; giving so much attention to such a questionable racial hate 
; crime in Florida, when there is such an obvious hate crime in 
; Oklahoma that has been almost totally ignored?
