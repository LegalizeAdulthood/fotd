; FOTD -- April 08, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As is apparent by now, there was no FOTD for April 7, nor will 
; there ever be one.  FL and I decided to take the day off and go 
; out and have a good time.
; 
; Today's image is named "Metempsychosis".  This does not refer to 
; some weird mental illness, it is another name for reincarnation 
; or the transfer of souls from one physical body to another.  (I 
; leave it to the individual fractalist to decide exactly what a 
; soul is.)  I gave the image this name because it is a rebirth of 
; the numbers of the most recent image, the one for April 6, which 
; I quit working on a bit too soon.
; 
; Today's image is a simple but dramatic recoloring of the same 
; image.  Actually, it is not exactly the same image.  The image 
; of April 6 had no logmap in effect, while today's version has a 
; logmap value of 375.  But it is close enough to be virtually 
; identical.
; 
; The color palette, which contrasts deep blues with fiery 
; reds and oranges, is not a new one.  It has often been used, but 
; it raises the rating from a humdrum 6 to a very respectful 8.
; 
; The calculation time is the same as that of the April 6 image -- 
; a slightly slow 3-1/2 minutes.  The web sites can eliminate the 
; wait however.
; 
; View the finished image online at:

; 
; Yesterday turned out to be such a perfect early spring day 
; (cloudless skies and temperature of 61F 16C) that FL and I 
; decided to take an expedition out to Bellefonte, which lies 55 
; miles (US measure) or 88 kilometers (real distance) west of FC, 
; to visit an old movie theater that was turned into an antique 
; emporium.  The fractal cats, who were left behind, apparently 
; slept most of the time we were away, though when we returned to 
; FC we found that they had been active enough to finish the food 
; we left out for them.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, and that is virtually 
; certain.  Until then, take care, and what are those elusive 
; souls made of? . . . perhaps some of those elusive theorized but 
; undiscovered particles?
