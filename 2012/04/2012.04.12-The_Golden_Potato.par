; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- April 12, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There was no FOTD for April 11.  It's a minor tragedy, but the 
; resilient FOTD has survived and will continue into the 
; indefinite if not quite eternal future.
; 
; Today's image takes us into the parent fractal that results when 
; the formula Z^(1.5)+C is iterated 11 levels up the hyperladder 
; with the recip function applied.
; 
; This parent is curious in that it has a prominent main period-2 
; bud, while the East Valley area appears to have been absorbed in 
; its surroundings.  Today's image lies in the chaotic debris that 
; marks the area where I assume the East Valley should be found.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 shows that I consider the image to be in 
; every way average, though I did add an extra 1/2 point for some 
; extra coloring work.
; 
; The name "The Golden Potato" shows what can happen when whimsy 
; is given full rein.  It has nothing to do with the image, but 
; could draw a few extra viewers who might be curious about what a 
; golden potato has to do with fractals.
; 
; The calculation time of 7-1/2 minutes will drag.  Luckily, a 
; great speed-up is available on the web sites, where the image 
; may be viewed instantly.
; 
; Live in peace by viewing the finished image on the official FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Extend the peaceful feelings by checking the high-definition 
; version at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Appreciate the full extent of the fractal grandeur on the 
; original FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A mix of clouds and sun with a temperature of 57F 14C made today 
; a typical mid-April day in Central Pennsylvania.  The fractal 
; cats took the day as it happened.  They were neither happy nor 
; dis-satisfied.
; 
; The humans had a typically busy day.  Typical means nothing 
; happened to make the day memorable.  The next FOTD is scheduled 
; to be posted in 24 hours.  Don't be disappointed however if it 
; is delayed.  The posting schedule has been rather irregular 
; recently.  Until whenever, take care, and everyone knows 
; eaxctly what the real answers to the world's problems are.  But 
; what is wrong with those who cannot see the truth of these 
; answers?
