; FOTD -- April 14, 2012 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is the first of several variations on the image of 
; Friday, April 13th.  Two East Valley elephants again appear in 
; the scene, but today something has gone wrong with them.  The 
; elephants have not only lost control of their buds, they have 
; lost their legs.  Instead of standing guard over their buds, the 
; elephants are sitting on them, and now totally legless, appear 
; to be on the verge of abandoning their duties.  (I have no idea 
; how elephants with no legs can survive in the first place.  It's 
; a question that still needs an answer.)
; 
; To do these terrible things to the steadfast elephants, I 
; calculated the East Valley area of the Mandelbrot set at an 
; angle double rotated 1 and 1 degrees from the Julia orientation. 
; When viewed from this angle, the features that define the 
; Mandelbrot aspect are enlarged to many times their normal size.  
; At the same time, the Mandelbrot buds and Julia elephants shift 
; position, making it pretty much a random guess which bud the 
; morphing elephants will find themselves standing over.  In 
; today's image the Mandelbrot buds are of order 42 and 41, which 
; means that the elephants are not quite the same ones that 
; appeared in yesterday's FOTD, though they are close enough 
; however to make little difference.
; 
; The color palette is the same unspectacular, earthen one that I 
; used in yesterday's image; and once again I have declined to 
; give a rating to the image.  I consider it amusing to distort 
; the eastern elephants, but I do not expect all fractalists, 
; especially those who prefer brilliant colors, to find equal 
; enjoyment.
; 
; The name "Variation-1" simply numbers the variation of the 
; original theme.  More variations will appear on the days to come.
; 
; Today's image is not created with the high-speed type=mandel 
; formula, so it requires a much longer calculation time of 6 
; minutes to finish.  The FOTD web sites can cut the viewing time 
; to a tiny fragment of this however.
; 
; The finished GIF image is posted in 640x480 resolution at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition rendering is online at:

; All the past FOTD images and discussions are available at:

;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The days continue to get better here at Fractal Central.  Today 
; brought lots of hazy sun and a temperature of 70F 21C, making it 
; seem more like midsummer than the middle of spring.  The clouds 
; thickened later in the afternoon, but by then a good day was 
; already in the bag.  The fractal cats had a quiet day in the 
; window.  Apparently the dynamic duo had already cleared the 
; neighborhood of unwanted stray tomcats.
; 
; The humans had an average day, which is not as average as first 
; appears.  FL spent the day visiting with an old friend back in 
; Baltimore, while I had FC to myself.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and to find what's 
; really behind the news, don't watch the TV news channels.
