; FOTD -- April 15, 2012 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is the second variation on the theme of the East 
; Valley elephants.  I have named it "Two Half-Elephants".  
; Actually, the name is not quite correct.  The elephants in 
; question are not exactly half-elephants, they are 12/25 
; elephants, which makes them a little less than half-elephants.
; 
; The problem with today's elephants is that the parent fractal is 
; not the Mandelbrot set, it is the Mandeloid that results when 
; the expression Z^(1.48)+C is iterated 11 steps up the hyper-
; stairway with the floor function applied.  This figure is a near 
; shapeless blob, with a rudimentary East Valley.  Today's scene 
; lies on the south side of this valley.
; 
; The curled trunks of the elephants are quite apparent, as are 
; their fat rumps, but their middle sections seem to have 
; vanished.  The beasts still faithfully guard their appointed 
; buds however, even though the buds are shrunken shriveled things 
; that almost no one but a fractal fanatic would find interesting.
; 
; The semi-elephants are filled with smaller semi-elephants, 
; apparently all the way down.  The image is also filled with 
; minibrots, though I have made no effort to track them down.
; 
; The name "Two Semi-Elephants" fairly describes the scene.  Since 
; by this time the elephant theme is a bit worn out, I declined to 
; rate the image.
; 
; The calculation time of 9-1/4 minutes is far more that what the 
; image is worth.  Here again, the FOTD web sites gallop to the 
; rescue.
; 
; Check in at the official FOTD web site to see the finished image 
; without the need of calculating it.  The web site may be 
; accessed at:

; 
; The day began with heavy clouds and light sprinkles of rain here 
; at Fractal Central, but by noon the clouds broke, leading to a 
; partly cloudy afternoon with a temperature of 75F 24C.  The 
; fractal cats had a relatively normal day of sleeping anywhere 
; they could find.  With the warmer weather here, they no longer 
; seek the afternoon sun.  Meanwhile, the humans had a quiet day, 
; except for FL, who spent the afternoon working in her garden.
; 
; The next FOTD, a continuation of the elephant theme, is 
; scheduled to be posted in 24 hours.  From the way things have 
; been going lately however, I would not be surprised if it were 
; late.  Until then, take care, and even the wisest among us know 
; almost nothing.
