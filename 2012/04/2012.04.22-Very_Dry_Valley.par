; 
; FOTD -- April 22, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the main stem of a Mandelbrot set 
; corrupted in its depths by Z^(1.9)+C energies.  The effect of 
; this corruption is to create a main stem that on the surface 
; appears to be infinitely deep but comes to a dead end.  As a 
; result, the minibrots on the stem suffer increasing amounts of 
; cut-off distortion as they grow smaller, until a level is 
; reached where minibrots no longer exist.
; 
; Today's scene lies in the minibrot around -1.67, which has a 
; huge chunky valley where the west part of its main bay and large 
; period-2 bud should lie.  The scene of the image lies in a nest 
; of filaments in this valley.
; 
; The object that fills the image is what I call a dry valley, a 
; pattern with apparent two-way symmetry that appears to have a 
; minibrot at its center but dies out before the minibrot is 
; reached.  Take my word, there is no unresolved minibrot at the 
; center of today's image.
; 
; One thing I do see however is eight stands of fractal trees 
; trying to grow around the edge of the valley.  Just enough 
; resolution remains to fill the screen with one of them.
; 
; The rating of an 8 is based mostly on the brilliant colors in 
; the central part of the image.  The much smoother bluish outer 
; part was created by myself.
; 
; The name "Very-Dry Valley" refers to the richness of detail in 
; what could have been a fractal failure.
; 
; The calculation time of 3 minutes is a fair price for such a 
; colorful fractal.
; 
; The finished image is posted on sale in all its glory on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version, which simply oozes glory, is posted 
; at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; All the past FOTD's since April 1997 are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where they bring more than enough fractal enjoyment for one 
; lifetime.
; 
; Today brought heavy clouds with increasing wind and rain to 
; Fractal Central.  The fractal cats checked the temperature of 
; 46F +8C, took a few glances out the back window, decided that 
; the unwanted cats were at a safe distance, and found comfortable 
; places to curl up and sleep.  The humans just took it easy.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and what will we do if it turns out that the world is a 
; dream after all?
