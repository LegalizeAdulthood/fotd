; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- April 20, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we take a break from the lumbering elephants and turn 
; instead to a fractal fantasy land created by the JulibrotMulti2 
; formula, which does things too complicated to describe in less 
; than a long paragraph.  But how we got here does not matter.  
; The fact is that here we are and we have found an image unusual 
; enough to be declared FOTD for April 20.
; 
; The image is almost but not quite a Julia set, since it is 
; double rotated 1.5,1.5 degrees from the true Julia orientation.  
; It is also barely an image at all, with both its inside and 
; outside parts rendered with the 'FMOD' option.
; 
; I named the image "Springtime Blues" because of the time of year 
; in the Northern Hemisphere and the somber moody colors of the 
; scene.  In the Southern Hemisphere the name should be changed to 
; "Autumnal Blues", which better matches the mood of the image.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 includes a half-point bonus for the 
; coloring.  The bonus is pretty much a gift however.  The F8 key 
; did most of the work.
; 
; Luckily, the image is a reasonably fast one that finishes in 
; about 40 seconds on most machines, even with the single-pass 
; option in effect.  The unusually small magnitude of 0.18 is 
; mostly responsible for the speed.
; 
; Calculation may be avoided totally by viewing the finished image 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition version is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The entire FOTD history is online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today was a beauty here at Fractal central, with lots of sun, 
; enough clouds to make things interesting, and a temperature of 
; 75F 24C.  The fractal cats must have caught spring fever; they 
; slept through most of the afternoon.
; 
; The humans spent the day getting things caught up.  When we 
; finally did get caught up, FL somehow had energy to spare, which 
; she exhausted working in this year's garden.  With no energy to 
; spare, I fell asleep watching the news.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and in an effort to explain the quantum world, scientists 
; have invented the various mental models known as the QM 
; interpretations.  In an effort to explain the mystical world, 
; holy men have invented the various mental models known as the 
; world's religions.  To me, the message is that both scientists 
; and holy men face the same difficulty, and in all likelihood, 
; are investigating and trying to explain and communicate the same 
; incomprehensible reality.
