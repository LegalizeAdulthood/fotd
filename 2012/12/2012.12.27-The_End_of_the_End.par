; FOTD -- December 27, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After a brief break during which the world did not end, the FOTD 
; has returned with another fractal.  Like all other fractals, 
; today's has existed for all eternity but has never been seen by 
; intelligent beings until today.
; 
; The parent fractal shows what happens when 2 parts of Z^2 are 
; mixed with 2 negative parts of Z^(-0.9) and straight C is added 
; on each iteration.  This parent consists of a rather distorted 
; Mandeloid set with a large triangular area of chaos to the 
; northwest and a much smaller Mandeloid set some distance to the 
; southwest.  Today's image lies in the triangular area of chaos.
; 
; The name "The End of the End" points out that the latest end of 
; the world has come and gone, and like all previous ends of the 
; world, it was a total failure.  Of course, true believers will 
; claim that some hugely important but invisible thing, such as a 
; 'harmonic convergence', did actually happen, but was not noticed 
; or reported by the mass media, which is controlled by the big 
; greedy corporations for their own benefit.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/3 minutes will pass in less time 
; than it takes for a harmonic convergence to manifest.  But the 
; web sites will remove all traces of harmonic convergency.
; 
; The chore of calculation may be avoided by viewing the finished 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; High definition variations are at:

; The back images may be accessed at:

;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; 1-1/2 inches (4cm) of snow fell on Christmas Eve here at Fractal 
; Central, not quite enough to make an honest white Christmas, but 
; just enough to make the kids happy.  The day after Christmas 
; brought 5 inches (12cm) of heavy sleety snow to the area, making 
; more of a nuisance than a post card scene.  Today was cloudy 
; with a temperature of freezing.  The fractal cat kept busy 
; watching for the occasional passing snowflake, while the humans 
; recovered from the holiday.
; 
; The next FOTD will be ready by this time tomorrow.  Whether it 
; is posted as soon as it is ready remains to be seen.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and we should not even think of passing 
; futile laws to solve our current problems such as climate change 
; or easy access to guns.  Such laws will do nothing but create 
; more division, more criminals, and increase overall contention.  
; If a solution to our problems is to be successful, it must be 
; accepted and acted upon by everyone from the far right to the 
; far left.  If no such solution is possible, then our problems 
; have no solution, and it is time to stop wasting energy, to 
; blame the other guy and prepare for the end.
