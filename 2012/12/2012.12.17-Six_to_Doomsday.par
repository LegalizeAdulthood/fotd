; FOTD -- December 15, 2012 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; If you're looking for a long fractal discussion, look elsewhere. 
; For the next several days I'll be spreading my ideas about the 
; disintegration of our culture.
; 
; Today's image is a near-Julia set of the Z^(1.5)+C ground level 
; Mandeloid.  It is rotated 0.01 degree toward the Oblate 
; direction, and is striking for the number and variety of fractal 
; trees it holds.  And like the strange mysterious rectangle, it 
; is also one of my very early fractals.
; 
; The finished image is at:

; 
; When I began the countdown to doomsday, I was being frivolous.  
; I didn't actually expect the end of time to come on December 21. 
; Until now, all predictions of the end of the world have had one 
; thing in common -- they have been wrong.  But now, after the 
; latest school massacre, it looks like I could be right, maybe 
; not in six days, but not too long thereafter.  With unending 
; massacres and depressed adolescents walking about in a 
; technological trance, texting like frustrated demons, maybe the 
; end really is approaching, at least the end of our present way 
; of life.  Invading aliens from Alpha Centauri could hardly have 
; done a better job of destruction than we have done and are still 
; doing to ourselves.
; 
; The human race is a part of the great spiritual reality known as 
; nature.  (Of course, rationalists will deny the spiritual part.) 
; With all the technological gadgets, video games, mass media 
; entertainment etc. we have basically cut ourselves off from our 
; source and are floundering about like fish out of water.  And 
; what are we willing to do about it?  Little more than purchase 
; ever more advanced technological devices.
; 
; Technology will save us . . . I guess it will, but . . . then 
; again I'm not too sure.
; 
; I see myself as one of a dying breed.  When I go out on my 
; morning walk to the nearby river, I carry no smart device with 
; me.  I enjoy the nature in which I am immersed.  I see the high 
; clouds in the sky indicating that warmer weather is on the way.  
; I see the early sun striking the bare treetops.  At the river I 
; see that the water level has gone down a bit.  It has been 
; rather dry recently.  And I hear honking.  Looking up, I see 
; geese flying overhead.  Out on the water I see ducks bobbing, 
; and an egret wading near the bank.  And all this is free.  Then 
; I think of a local boy who was killed about a week ago when he 
; was struck by a train while walking along the tracks to school.  
; His hi-tech headset was so loud that he did not hear the train 
; coming.
; 
; Could something be wrong with our modern life style?
; 
; It's no problem however.  Before long, the codgers like myself 
; who still remember the old times will be gone, and everyone will 
; be free to enjoy the technological wonderland we are creating 
; for ourselves.
; 
; The day actually turned rather pleasant here at Fractal Central. 
; At least the cats thought so.  The temperature of 46F +8C was 
; above normal, while the variably cloudy sky let through just 
; enough sun to keep things cheerful.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in about 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and there are 
; far too many people being killed with illegal guns.  Why can't 
; our congressmen get off their bottoms and pass legislation 
; banning illegal guns?  (Hey, I actually heard it on the local 
; talk radio.)
