; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- December 29, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; On its surface, the Z^(-2)+C Mandeloid is not much to look at -- 
; little more than a triangle consisting of flat overlapping 
; disks.  The disks can be made larger or smaller by changing the 
; escape radius, but this has little effect on the worth of the 
; fractal.
; 
; All is not lost however.  When the entire Julibrot is sliced in 
; different directions, it shows some aspects that are more 
; interesting.  In today's image I have double rotated the slice 
; 66 and 66 degrees toward the Julia orientation, and rendered it 
; with the outside parts set to 'real'.  In the image, we see that 
; the flat disks have become organized into more attractive semi-
; chaotic spirals.  (The parent fractal actually has buds, but 
; this is a story for another day.)
; 
; I named the image "Faerie Fantasyland".  The odd spelling is 
; kind of a trendy pseudo-magical way of spelling the word 
; 'fairy', which is used by those who are into new-age stuff.
; 
; The rating of a 7 includes a full point for the smooth GIF 
; coloring, which I really did put an hour or so of effort into.  
; Without the coloring, the underlying scene would rate only a 6.
; 
; The image is very fast.  It finishes in under one minute on all 
; but the oldest and slowest units.
; 
; The image may be viewed without the inconvenience of setting up 
; and running the included parameter file.  Simply surf over to 
; the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and view it there.
; 
; High-definition variations are posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The back images are posted to the venerable FOTD web site at
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Snow fell all day here at Fractal Central today, while the light 
; winds and relatively mild temperature of 30F -1C actually made 
; the snow enjoyable.  At post time about 5 inches or 12cm had 
; piled up, but it was still falling.  I'll give a final report 
; in the next FOTD.  The fractal cat alternated between stretching 
; out on the radiator and hunching on the shelf in the southwest 
; window, watching the snowflakes drift down.  The humans took it 
; as easy as possible, but I am concerned with the sidewalk that 
; will eventually need to be cleared.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted when it is ready, most likely in 
; 24 hours.  Until whenever, take care, and I see that two people 
; have been pushed in front of subway trains within a month.  
; These trains are dangerous.  We must do something about the 
; needless deaths caused by misused subway trains.  We must pass 
; tighter train-control laws to keep subway trains from the hands 
; of those who would misuse them.
