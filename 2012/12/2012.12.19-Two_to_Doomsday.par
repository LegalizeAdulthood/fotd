; FOTD -- December 19, 2012 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; What we are witnessing in today's image is the death of the cur-
; ious rectangle.  No longer anywhere near perfect, the former 
; quadrilateral has been twisted into a bent wet noodle.  I began 
; the destruction by altering the parameters, thereby changing 
; both the orientation and location of the slice.  The destruction 
; will continue in the next two FOTD's, and then, who knows or 
; cares what?  The day of doom will be upon us, when the fate of 
; an abstract fractal rectangle will have less significance than 
; an ant trapped on a stick in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
; 
; But despite the hopelessness, the image is still worth a quick 
; look.  It calculates in only one minute, about as much time as 
; is required to check the finished image on the web sites.
; 
; The image is posted to the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; with high definition variations at:

; 
; The FOTD back images are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Mostly cloudy skies and a temperature of 45F +7C made today 
; totally unremarkable.  The fractal cat had an unremarkable day 
; also.  The humans' day was a bit more animated as we watched the 
; midday news reports, frustrated that the current determination 
; to see something done about the gun situation will soon fade 
; away as people 'get over' their outrage.  Despite my recent 
; comments, both FL and I feel there are far too many guns in our 
; culture, which is violent enough as it is; but like nearly 
; everyone else, we haven't the slightest idea what to do about it.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and let's get people who act different off the streets and 
; into therapy.  (Hey, wait a minute!  That would include myself!)
