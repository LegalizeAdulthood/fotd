; FOTD -- December 14, 2012 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today there are only seven short days before the end of time, 
; and we all know how quickly a day can go by.  But even when we 
; are all gone, fractals will continue forever, so who am I to 
; give up on fractals when they will never give up on me.
; 
; Today's image is a view of the mysterious Z^(2.003) rectangle as 
; it appears when rotated 4 degrees from the Julia direction 
; toward the oblate direction.  At this angle the original 
; rectangle appears more like a fan partly filled with debris, but 
; in this debris a new shorter and wider rectangle has appeared.
; 
; The features surrounding the rectangle have been altered to the 
; point of unrecognizability, though a few patches of the pure 
; Julia features still remain.  And even though today's change is 
; great, you ain't seen nothing yet!
; 
; The name "Seven to Doomsday" simply tells the time remaining for 
; each of us to exist.  The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes cuts 
; into this brief time, but let's eat, drink and be merry today, 
; for in seven days we . . .?
; 
; Time is growing short.  Before the final end arrives, check the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; And enjoy the variations in high definition at:

; 
; The back images are available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Lots of sun and a temperature of 46F +8C made today quite 
; pleasant here at Fractal Central.  While the cats watched the 
; world go by, the humans kept busy preparing for the upcoming 
; holidays, which will be in the past in 19 days -- that is unless 
; the day of doom arrives in only seven days, in which case the 
; holidays will never end.
; 
; The next FOTD is due to be posted in 24 hours, so check for it 
; then.  Until next time, take care, and there has been another 
; mass shooting.  Ho hum!  Such mass shootings are becoming all 
; the rage among the trendy set.  It looks like everyone wants a 
; slice of the action!
; 
; But murder is wrong!  Something must be done!  So why don't we 
; ban all private possession of firearms?  Then when a lunatic 
; shoots up a school and kills some kids, we'll be able to charge 
; him with possession of an illegal and probably stolen firearm.  
; With such a serious charge hanging over his head and possible 
; imprisonment facing him, even the most determined lunatic would 
; think twice before killing innocent people.
; 
; My opinion -- to ban all firearms would be futile.
; 
; My solution -- to change the materialistic, technologically 
; advanced but spiritually bankrupt world view of our modern 
; culture, which makes our existence appear meaningless and 
; totally hopeless.  (And I don't mean we should go out and try to 
; persuade people to believe in any particular religion.)
