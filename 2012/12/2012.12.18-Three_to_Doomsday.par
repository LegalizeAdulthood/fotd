; FOTD -- December 18, 2012 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal features another glance at the Z^(2.003)+C 
; rectangle.  This time I have adorned it with a lively blue-and-
; gold color scheme, and sliced it at an angle rotated -1,-1,-1,+1 
; degrees from the true Julia orientation.
; 
; Actually, the image is one of the better apparitions of the 
; rectangle.  Unfortunately, if the predicted doom actually 
; arrives in three days, this could be the final apparition.
; 
; The name "Three to Doomsday" indicates that the end is near 
; enough for knees to begin knocking in terror.
; 
; But the calculation time of 1-1/3 minutes will squander little 
; of the brief remaining time.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; with hi-def variations at:

; 
; and all the back images at:

;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Heavy clouds and showers of rain put a damper on outdoor 
; activities here at Fractal Central today.  The temperature of 
; 48F +9C was mild for the season however, and kept the unpleasant-
; ness at a minimum.  The cats, always pleasant, slept through 
; most of the day.  A full-day's sleep might seem boring to humans 
; but it is quite normal for cats.  The humans continued to watch 
; the TV news and continued to wonder why no one even recognizes 
; the underlying cause of gun violence.
; 
; The next FOTD, (due to doomsday, possibly the third to last), 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and some say 
; the solution to gun violence is to enact sweeping legislation to 
; protect us from such violence.  Perhaps we must ban the private 
; possession of all guns.  (I actually heard it.)  Of course, if 
; such legislation were ever passed, the result in rural areas 
; such as Central Pennsylvania would be to turn the farmers, who 
; would not give up their guns, into criminals.  And if anyone 
; then tried to enforce the gun ban, the result would be civil war.
; (I heard this also.)
