; 
; FOTD -- May 10, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD rating has slipped to a 7, but I assure all 
; concerned FOTD fans that the drop is temporary and not a sign 
; of things to come.  
; 
; The parent fractal is a variation of yesterday's parent, with 
; only the portions changed.  Today we mix the same 0.25 part of 
; Z^(2) with a much reduced 0.5 part of Z^(-5) before we add 
; straight C on each iteration.  The change opens up more of the 
; underlying Mandelbrot set, which now is much more recognizable.  
; A large area of (-5) stuff still fills much of the main bay, 
; with today's scene located in the Seahorse Valley of a partly 
; obscured minibrot on the northeast edge of this 'stuff'.  The 
; name "In a Vague Valley" refers to this almost totally obscured 
; underlying valley.
; 
; I retained most of yesterday's colors, making only a few changes 
; to increase the contrast between the outer grayness and the 
; brilliantly colored fractal object lying diagonally across the 
; frame.
; 
; This object resembles a Julia set of the Seahorse Valley type, 
; which is not surprising, since it lies in the Seahorse Valley of 
; the partially hidden minibrot.
; 
; These partially hidden minibrots pose a puzzle.  I suspect that 
; the generating expression has a second critical point and that 
; if Z were initialized to that other starting point, the hidden 
; minibrot would be revealed in its full glory.  So far however, 
; I have been unable to find one of these hidden minibrots.
; 
; The calculation time of today's image is a rather slow 3-1/2 
; minutes, making the FOTD web sited a good choice.
; 
; Make life easy by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Make life a pleasure by viewing it in high definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Add to the pleasure by checking all the back FOTD images at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A typical early-May mix of clouds and sun prevailed here at 
; Fractal Central today, with a brief but heavy afternoon shower 
; adding interest.  The temperature of 59F 15C was mild enough to 
; keep the fractal cats happy and keep the house heat turned low.
; 
; The humans had another dull but satisfactory day.  With FL 
; growing less liberal as the years pass, we rarely disagree on 
; politics any longer, though she did grow agitated when on the 
; noontime news we saw someone in congress stand up and point out 
; that the bible says gay people should be put to death.  But 
; since I agreed with her, we had nothing to debate.
; 
; One other thing never debatable is that the next FOTD will soon 
; be posted.  The only uncertainty is the exact hour.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and liberal ideals are great.  It's too bad 
; they are only ideals that all too often fail to work.  Oh well, 
; there are always the conservatives to pin the blame on.
