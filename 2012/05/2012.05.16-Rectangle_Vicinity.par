; FOTD -- May 15, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we return to the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid and 
; the 'rail-yard' area just east of the split-apart largest 
; minibrot on the main spike, where a curious rectangle is found 
; in some of the Julia sets as well as the Mandelbrot set.  The 
; rectangle does not appear in today's image, though many of the 
; larger features of the Julia sets with the rectangle are quite 
; apparent.
; 
; The name "Rectangle Vicinity" simply describes the location of 
; the scene in the Julibrot.  The rating of an 8 shows that at the 
; time I rated the image I considered it to be quite a fine one.  
; However, there is no guarantee that my impression of the image's 
; worth will remain unchanged forever.  The perceived worth of 
; fractal images has a way of improving or worsening with time.
; 
; The calculation wait of 1-5/6 minutes will pass reasonably 
; swiftly.  Of course the image may always be seen on the web 
; sites without the hassle of calculation.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition rendering is available at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; All the FOTD back images and discussions may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The rain continued through the night, but ended this morning, 
; followed by slowly breaking clouds for the rest of the day, with 
; a temperature of 72F 22C.  The fractal cats, being totally 
; inside cats, rarely concern themselves with weather, since it 
; doesn't happen indoors.  The indoor temperature and position of 
; the sun is what they notice.  Today was satisfactory for them.
; 
; Clouds and rainy days are a bit of a downer for humans however, 
; but with an operational sump pump and enough work to keep things 
; busy, the FC humans had little time to worry about the weather.  
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and we need skeptics as well as true believers.
