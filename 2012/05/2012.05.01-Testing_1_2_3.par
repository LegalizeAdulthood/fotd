; FOTD -- May 01, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's a new month and time for a new theme.  To escape the rut of 
; mathematical interest only, I have decided to make May the month 
; of images with artistic value.  And there is no formula I know 
; of that creates images more artistic than those created by the 
; workhorse MandAutoCritInZ.
; 
; To lead off the month, we check the parent fractal that results 
; when Z^(2.01) is subtracted from Z^2 and straight C is added on 
; each iteration.  Intuition says that this fractal will be little 
; more than an oversized Mandelbrot set.  Well, the fractal is 
; oversized sure enough.  A bailout radius of 1100 was neded to 
; fit it all in, but the fractal is far from an everyday 
; Mandelbrot set.
; 
; This parent fractal actually resembles a Z^(2.5)+C Mandeloid far 
; more than it resembles the classic M-set.  In addition, it is 
; rotated 180 degrees so that the side normally on the east lies 
; on the west.  Its East Valley has split into two well-defined 
; valleys, with the area between filled with many discontinuities 
; that call for exploration.  Its main period-2 bud has sprouted 
; two large sub-buds, each growing its own infinitely divided main 
; spike.  Today's image is located in the area of discontinuities 
; between the two large sub-buds.
; 
; The name "Testing 1-2-3" is what a sound man traditionally says 
; to test the levels of his sound system.  It came about when I 
; saw myself setting up for an actual entire month of worthwhile 
; fractals.  The rating of a 7 that I gave today's image is not 
; particularly outstanding, but I'm still not totally back into 
; artistic mode.  The ratings will (hopefully) increase as the 
; month progresses.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-2/3 minutes is a fair price for a 
; fractal with a rating of a 7.  And the web sites are always 
; there for those who would rather miss the fun of calculation.
; 
; The finished image is online at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition rendering is at:

; 
; All the past images are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today brought a mix of clouds and sun to Fractal Central.  The 
; pleasant temperature of 77F 25C made the periods of clouds seem 
; much more pleasant than they might have been.  The fractal cat 
; duo was very active, chasing each other up and down the hallway 
; until Nicholas finally ran out of energy.
; 
; The humans, who never chase each other up and down the hallway, 
; had a more restful day doing routine things.  The next FOTD will 
; be posted soon.  (I'll no longer mention 24 hours, since the 
; time between postings is irregular, and has rarely if ever been 
; exactly 24 hours.)  Until next time, take care, and it looks 
; like it might be fractals all the way down.
