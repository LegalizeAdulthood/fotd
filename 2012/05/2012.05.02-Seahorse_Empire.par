; FOTD -- May 02, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we begin the climb out of the rut left by 
; that herd of ponderous elephants.  The image lies rather deep in 
; the Seahorse Valley area of yesterday's parent fractal, on the 
; bud side of the northern branch.
; 
; I named the image "Seahorse Empire" because it it filled with 
; miniature seahorses.  You will have to look hard to find them 
; however.  They are not very obvious.  (I have never been as 
; impressed with fractal seahorses as I am with fractal elephants.)
; 
; The rating of an 8 shows that I am rather satisfied with the 
; image however, which is certainly more colorful if not as 
; mathematically interesting as those elephant images of a week or 
; so ago.
; 
; The chief fault of the image is its excessive calculation time 
; of 12 minutes.  But here is where the FOTD web sites charge to 
; save the day.

; 
; Heavy clouds moved in overnight here at Fractal Central, leading 
; to a rain shower at daybreak.  The rain soon ended but the 
; clouds remained for the rest of the day, holding the temperature 
; to a slightly chilly 64F 18C.  The fractal cats seemed satisfied 
; with the weather, and spent the day involved in more important 
; things, such as chasing each other around the house and asking 
; for more food.
; 
; The humans, being human, had more serious things to do, such as 
; finishing the day's work, which they did on schedule.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted soon.  No exact time is implied.  Until next 
; time, take care, and on a recent 'science' show I heard of a 
; theory that the universe might be shaped like a dodecahedron.  
; The announcer then took a soccer ball and said he was holding a 
; dodecahedron, and it might be how the universe is shaped.  It's 
; strange.  I thought the pattern on a soccer ball is a truncated 
; icosahedron, a figure with 32 faces, (20 hexagons and 12 
; pentagons), and not a dodecahedron with only 12 pentagons as 
; faces.  Are TV 'scientists' truly this ignorant of basic 
; geometry?
