; FOTD -- May 14, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; We're back on track with today's 8-rated image.
; 
; The generating expression combines 0.1 part of plain Z with 11 
; parts of Z^(11) before adding straight C on each iteration.  
; This combination produces a parent fractal consisting of an 
; order-11 Mandeloid that at first appears non-critical.  A closer 
; look however reveals areas that are in fact critical, and filled 
; with quadratic minibrots.  Today's scene lies in the East Valley 
; area of a large minibrot in the details surrounding the northern 
; bay.
; 
; Since the image lies in an East Valley, elephant bits and pieces 
; are plentiful.  In today's image the curling trunks predominate.
; 
; The name "The Richest Elephant" refers to the unusual richness 
; of the image's colors.  These colors are mostly a lucky accident 
; that came about with one tap of the 'enter' key.  I did do a bit 
; of tweaking however, but the Fractint program still did most of 
; the work.
; 
; The calculation time of 3 minutes will pass quickly once the 
; coarse image appears on the screen.  The web sites will give an 
; even faster view.
; 
; See the finished image instantly on the FOTD web site at:

; 
; Heavy clouds and steady rain totally spoiled the day here at FC, 
; at least for those who work outside.  At Fractal Central we do 
; our work indoors, so the rain was little more than a curiosity.  
; The fractal cats approved of the temperature, which reached 64F 
; 18C, and showed their approval by sleeping through most of the 
; afternoon.
; 
; The humans, FL and I, had another typical day, which satisfies 
; us if not those waiting for some fractal excitement.  The next 
; FOTD will soon be posted.  The exact time depends on the meaning 
; of the word 'soon'.  Until whenever, take care, and true 
; rational skeptics never concern themselves with things like 
; space aliens or ghosts, except to debunk them.  They know that 
; it's impossible for any species no matter how intelligent, to 
; overcome the astronomical distances.  And as for ghosts, the 
; skeptics know they are mere natural phenomena mis-interpreted by 
; the brain to satisfy the instinctive hope of immortality.
