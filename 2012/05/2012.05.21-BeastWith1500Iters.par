; FOTD -- May 21, 2012 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates a 9.  In my opinion it is worth it.  I have 
; rarely seen a FOTD fractal image with such a solid-looking ring 
; filling such a large part of the frame.  With perhaps a bit too 
; much exaggeration, I named it "Beast With 1500 Iterations".
; 
; The parent fractal is a moth-eaten series of bays and other 
; assorted open areas that came about when I subtracted 0.3 parts 
; of Z^(2.5) from 0.6 part of Z^(-1.5) and added straight C on 
; each iteration.
; 
; The most obvious feature of this parent is a twisted Mandeloid 
; at its the northern end, with the northern side of the main bud 
; connecting into another, even more distorted, Mandeloid, which 
; does not appear to be critical.  Today's scene is located in 
; what I take to be the southern branch of Seahorse Valley of the 
; northern Mandeloid.
; 
; The striking effect of solidity in today's image was created by 
; rendering the scene with the inside set to 'tdis' followed by 
; careful coloring.  For some reason I declined to award myself 
; the usual half-point bonus for extra effort on the coloring.  A 
; rating of 9 is exceptional enough as it is, however.
; 
; The name was inspired by those junky old horror movies that I 
; still enjoy watching.  They lacked the super-computerized 
; special-effect explosions, but made up for it by being so bad 
; that they were actually good.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/4 minutes may not pass in a flash, 
; but it will certainly pass in two flashes.  The flashing may be 
; eliminated by viewing the finished image on the web sites.
; 
; The glorious completed image is at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A more glorious hi-def rendering is at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Total glory lies at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where all the FOTD's are posted.
; 
; The day brought lots of clouds with a few breaks of sun, as 
; well as occasional periods of light rain to Fractal Central.  
; The temperature of 72F 22C was within a few degrees of normal, 
; making for a satisfactory day.  The day was also satisfactory 
; for the fractal cats, who watched birds, chased each other up 
; and down the fractal hallway, fought over the collapsible cat 
; cube, and asked for an extra treat.
; 
; With all else going well, the fractal humans had nothing to 
; complain about.  The next FOTD will be posted in the near 
; future.  Only time will tell if it goes well.  Until next time, 
; take care, and we think, therefore we might or might not be real.
