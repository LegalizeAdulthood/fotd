; FOTD -- May 22, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a step backward -- to a rating of a 7-1/2.  
; This rating is a true 7-1/2.  The extra half-point is not a 
; self-awarded bonus for the coloring, which was created by the 
; Fractint program, with only a minimum of tweaking by me.
; 
; The scene lies in the parent fractal that was created when I 
; combined 1.75 parts of Z^(2.5) with 2.5 parts of Z^(-2) on each 
; iteration before adding straight C.
; 
; This parent fractal is little more than scattered fractal 
; debris, with one prominent but small Mandeloid on the X-axis and 
; a large hour-glass shaped field of debris to its west.  Today's 
; scene is located in this hour-glass firld.
; 
; The image's effect was achieved by rendering it with the outside 
; set to 'tdis'.  For some reason I chose the name "Ultraviolet 
; Sunrise", though I doubt that any star could possibly be hot 
; enough to shine only in the ultraviolet range.
; 
; Despite it's average rating, the image is well worth a look, and 
; the speedy calculation time of 15 seconds will make the effort 
; hardly noticeable.
; 
; The image may be seen with no effort at all on the official FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; It may be seen in high definition at:

; 
; All the past FOTD images are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today was mostly cloudy but rather pleasant here at Fractal 
; Central, with just enough breaks in the clouds to let us know 
; that the sun was still up there.  The temperature of 77F 25C was 
; hard to beat.  The fractal cats had an active day, getting into 
; a tussle over their play cube.  The humans' day was active also, 
; doing everyday things.  The next FOTD will be posted in the not 
; too distant future.  Until next time, take care, and getting 
; impressions from the future is impossible, yet it does happen.
