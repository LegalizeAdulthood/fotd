; FOTD -- May 16, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; While browsing through fractal neverland last evening, I 
; wondered if the Z^(4.003)+C Mandeloid has Julia rectangles at 
; the east edge of the split-apart main-stem minibrot similar to 
; those found in the Z^(2.003)+C figure.  I found no rectangles, 
; but I did find today's curious scene, which I named "Almost But 
; Not There".
; 
; At first glance, the two minibrots appear to be perfect twins.  
; A closer examination however reveals subtle differences.  I 
; leave it to the viewer to recognize these differences.
; 
; Actually, the two minibrots do not lie as close together as 
; first appears.  A very prominent discontinuity cuts between 
; them, which the flat colors in the outer area mostly conceal.
; 
; The rating of a 7 might be a bit inflated.  If the image had 
; only one similar quartic minibrot, I would have consigned it to 
; wherever computer files go when they are deleted.  (Actually, 
; the information becomes hopelessly scrambled, but it still ex-
; ists in the universe in a diffuse form, and could theoretically 
; be recovered if we had the technology.)
; 
; Luckily, the image is a very fast one.  It finishes in a zippy 
; 55 seconds, and on some new-fangled multi-processor units it 
; could finish in less than half this time.
; 
; The finished image will be posted online for all to enjoy at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; but for technical reasons, it will not be posted until tomorrow.
; 
; For maximum enjoyment, a high-definition rendering is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and it will be available much sooner.
; 
; The web site with all the past FOTD images is online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; and more images are posted there than could possibly be enjoyed 
; in any single day.
; 
; Today proved to be one of the best so far this spring here at 
; Fractal Central, with lots of sun, puffy white clouds and a 
; temperature of 82F 28C.  Heavier clouds arrived in the evening, 
; and a few drops of rain filtered down, but by then the day was 
; already in the record books.
; 
; The fractal cats had no trouble enjoying themselves to the 
; utmost, keeping careful watch on a flock of birds that settled 
; in the back yard.  The humans were too busy with real work to 
; enjoy the fine weather, but by the end of the day, the work was 
; pretty much caught up.  The next FOTD will be posted in the near 
; future.  Until then, take care, and if the objects we experience 
; in dreams are made of thought instead of atoms, what then is 
; thought made of?
