; FOTD -- May 25, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image, with its flashy colors, rates a full 8.  This 
; does not include a bonus for the coloring, which was largely 
; created by the program and merely tweaked by myself.
; 
; The name "Bangles and Baubles" reflects my impression of the 
; scene, which is filled with trite whirls and spirals adorned 
; with flashy colors.
; 
; The parent fractal consists of a series of Mandel-like objects 
; lined along the Y-axis.  It was created when I combined Z^3 with 
; 0.203 part of Z^5 and added straight C on each iteration.  
; Today's scene lies in the 'East Valley' of a tiny 'minibrot' on 
; the Y-axis.  I used the quotes because it is a stretch of reason 
; to call these features actual valleys or minibrots.
; 
; The values of the parameters is extremely critical.  The 
; slightest change causes the entire image to disappear, and only 
; occasionally does something other than a blank screen replace it.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes borders on slowness, but 
; the image is flashy and rather worth the effort of calculation.  
; It is certainly worth a quick visit to the web sites.
; 
; The image is posted already calculated at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition version is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; All the images from the past 15 years are available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A typical mix of clouds and sun prevailed today here at Fractal 
; Central.  With the haze, humidity and temperature of 84F 29C, it 
; felt like a day in midsummer.  The fractal cats were happy with 
; the weather, but they have yet to settle who gets ownership of 
; the cat cube.  The only solution might be to pick up a few more 
; cubes.  Nicholas actually collapsed the cube himself by accident 
; while playing in it.
; 
; Unlike people in the movies, the humans of FC had an uneventful 
; day.  The next FOTD will not appear until Sunday the 27th.  We 
; are taking a one-day trip back to old FC on Saturday to take 
; care of a few chores.  Until next time, take care, and I see no 
; need to give up on the government schools; they gave up on 
; themselves many years ago.
