; FOTD -- May 29, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The name of today's FOTD, "Skeletal Remains", gives the 
; impression of something macabre.  But do not be deceived.  
; Today's image pictures nothing offensive.  It simply shows a 
; minibrot in the parent fractal that is produced when Z^3 is 
; subtracted from Z^2 and straight C is added.
; 
; I'll not try to describe this parent, since it is easy enough to 
; reproduce.  I'll simply report that today's scene is located in 
; a spurious valley on the west side of the westernmost and least 
; critical looking of the parent's two main bays.
; 
; Most of the terraced effect was created by rendering the scene 
; with the outside parts set to 'tdis'.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is right on FOTD average.  I would actually 
; prefer that every image be above average, but unlike Lake 
; Wobegon, where every child can be above average, the better the 
; fractals become, the higher the average grows.
; 
; The image is a rather slow one.  Expect around an eight minute 
; delay between striking the <enter> key and seeing the finished 
; image on the screen.
; 
; See the finished image without the need to calculate it, on the 
; official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Find bliss by checking the high-definition version posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Go totally bonkers by viewing thousands of back FOTD's at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Lots of sun, high humidity and a temperature of 91F 33C made 
; most of today quite sultry here at Fractal Central.  But at 4pm 
; a thunder shower moved in, which dropped the temperature to a 
; much more pleasant 70F 21C.  The fractal cats stretched out 
; while it was hot and braved the relatively mild thunder when it 
; cooled down.
; 
; The humans had an uneventful day.  This lack of events is 
; growing boring.  If we don't get a little more action in the 
; human world, I'll have to invent some.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and where is all 
; that change we can believe in?  I guess somebody spent it.
