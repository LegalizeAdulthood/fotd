; FOTD -- May 08, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; We're on a roll.  Despite its somber colors, today's image rates 
; another 8, and it was created by the warhorse MandAutoCritInZ 
; formula.
; 
; The parent fractal came about when I combined 0.25 part of Z^(2) 
; with 4 parts of Z^(-5) and added straight (C) on each iteration. 
; This parent appears as the rough outline of an oversized Mandel-
; brot set, with large irregular-shaped open areas where Seahorse 
; Valley would be expected, and a minibrot at the spot where the 
; large main-spike minibrot would be expected.  Most of the main 
; bay area is filled in with debris, but a small, somewhat distor-
; ted Mandeloid lies in the area of East Valley, with the East 
; Valley of this small Mandeloid merging with the East Valley of 
; the entire outline.  Today's scene lies in the interior of this 
; valley.
; 
; I named the image "Circular Square" because the brighter area 
; surrounding the central minibrot appears to be a square starting 
; to change into a circle.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes is brief enough to avoid 
; all risk of impatience.  The FOTD web sites will bring the risk 
; even lower, but there is still that parameter file to be run.
; 
; To avoid the hassle of setting up and running the included 
; parameter file, check in at the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition rendering of the image is online at:

; 
; Around 4500 FOTD back-images are posted at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Heavy clouds and steady rain made today a total loss here at 
; Fractal Central.  The temperature of 64F 18C was pleasant enough 
; at least for those who enjoy rain.  The fractal cats, who enjoy 
; staying dry indoors, had nothing to complain about.
; 
; The humans had little to complain about with the weather, since 
; we had nothing to do outdoors.  The local farmers, who have been 
; praying for rain, were equally satisfied.  The next FOTD will 
; soon be posted, though no specific time is implied.  Until then, 
; take care, and maybe it would be easier to solve our racial and 
; ethnic problems if certain news outlets would stop focusing on 
; every remaining unsolved problem and start focusing on the great 
; progress that has been made.  Accentuating the positive aspects 
; of a troublesome situation has great power to blunt the impact 
; of the negative aspects.
