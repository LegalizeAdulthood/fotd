; FOTD -- May 03, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is the third to come from the parent fractal of 
; two days ago.  It is located in the large minibrot on the west 
; branch of the filament extending from the large north bud of the 
; parent.
; 
; This minibrot is even more distorted than its parent fractal.  
; It looks more like a Z^2.5 minibrot than the Z^2 minibrot that 
; would be expected.  The west side of its main bay has two main 
; sub-buds, which are so far apart that a third bud has appeared 
; between them.  This new bud is split by a large valley, with 
; today's image located rather deep in this valley.
; 
; The rating of an 8 indicates that I think the image is pretty 
; good.  The name "A Deep North Valley" vaguely describes the 
; location of the image in a minibrot of its parent fractal.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/2 minutes is slightly slow, but 
; nowhere near as slow as yesterday's image.  As always, the web 
; sites with the finished images are ready to bring relief.
; 
; To see the SF-5 finished image, check in at:

; A high-definition rendering is posted at:

; 
; Several thousand images are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; After a crackling overnight thunder-storm, the day dawned cloudy 
; here at Fractal Central.  The clouds broke at midday, leading to 
; a mostly sunny afternoon with a temperature of 81F or 27C.  The 
; fractal cats were unsettled by the overnight thunder, but had a 
; relatively quiet day after things settled down.
; 
; The humans simply made it through the day without incident, 
; which is enough of an accomplishment in itself.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted soon.  Until that wonderful moment arrives, take 
; care, and if everyone on earth could take care of themselves, 
; what would those who enjoy helping others do to find happiness?
