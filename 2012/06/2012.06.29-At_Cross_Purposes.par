; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- June 29, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was created by subtracting 0.8 parts of Z^(1.25) 
; from 30 parts of an unlikely Z^(0.001) then adding straight C on 
; each iteration.  Normally, such a combination would not be 
; expected to do very much, and when I tried it, I expected 
; nothing.  But to my surprise a fractal did appear.  (We're close 
; to calculating 1-(Z^(1.25))+C on each iteration, so it really is 
; not that surprising.)
; 
; This parent fractal is shaped somewhat like a water bottle lying 
; on its side, with its cap facing east and large fields of debris 
; on the north and south sides of the enlongated main bay.  
; Today's image lies in the debris on the south side of the main 
; bay.
; 
; The rating of 7.5 would have been higher if I had put more 
; effort into the coloring.  The name "At Cross Purposes" looks 
; like it has a hidden meaning.  But like the names so many 
; surrealist artists give their works, it is nothing more than a 
; string of random words.
; 
; The calculation time of 50 seconds will pass very quickly, but 
; don't forget the FOTD web sites.
; 
; Enjoy life to the fullest.  View the finished image on the FOTD 
; web site at:

; 
; Additional enjoyment is online at:

; 
; Virtually unlimited enjoyment is available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where thousands of images and discussions are posted.
; 
; The heat arrived in full force today here at Fractal Central, 
; with blazing sun and a temperature of 97F 36C.  The fractal cats 
; found comfort under the cool air, which was running at coolest 
; setting.  The humans simply had another average day.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in a number of hours.  The exact number will 
; be known when the image is actually posted.  Until whenever, 
; take care, and if life turns boring, stir up a little action.
