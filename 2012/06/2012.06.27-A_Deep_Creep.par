; FOTD -- June 27, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Well, I see that the FOTD rating is again going down.  I'm not 
; sure why.  Sometimes the world of fractals seems to have a will 
; of its own, and despite my best efforts, it refuses to produce a 
; fractal that is even close to great.  I guess it's what artists 
; call a lack of inspiration, though I hardly consider myself a 
; fine artist.
; 
; Today's image rates a merely average 7.  We have seen many 
; similar images in the past, and this holds down the rating.  I 
; did put a bit of extra effort into the coloring, but the result 
; failed to be worth the usual half-point bonus.
; 
; Perhaps the most impressive thing about today's image is not the 
; image itself, but the parent fractal it lies in.  This parent is 
; not only oversized, it is immense, requiring a magnitude of 
; 0.0008 to fit it on the screen.  This parent is actually a very 
; distorted Mandelbrot set, rotated 180 degrees, with East Valley 
; on the west side and the infinitesimal main spike on the east 
; side.  It resembles an open figure eight with rounded areas of 
; debris lying both north and south of the main bay.  Today's 
; scene lies on the southeastern edge of the southern area of 
; debris.
; 
; I named the image "A Deep Creep".  Who knows why I gave it such 
; a name.  I, for one, certainly do not.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes is fast enough to avoid 
; impatience, yet slow enough to give ample time to enjoy the 
; fractal generation.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high definition rendering is at:

; The past FOTD images and writings are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A mix of sun and clouds with a temperature of 82F 28C made today 
; near ideal for those at Fractal Central, both humans and cats.  
; The cats had a fun day hiding in their squashable cat cubes, and 
; the humans had fun when the work went well.
; 
; The next FOTD is on the way!  If all goes well, it will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  All does not always go well however, so 
; there is no guarantee.  If the next FOTD is late, most likely 
; all did not go well.  Until whenever, take care, and "the 
; scientific method", which I once considered almost a religious 
; doctrine, now seems as awkward as the flounderings of a troupe 
; of first graders trying to perform "Hamlet".  (No, I do not have 
; anything better to offer.  My opinion is that it would take 
; attributes far above mankind's puny intelligence and the laws of 
; logic to solve the riddles of existence.  No wonder rational 
; science tries to ignore the really big questions.)
