; FOTD -- June 10, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The formula behind today's image -- CrazyMidgets -- is a 
; 13-year-old version of the MandAutoCritInZ formula that I use so 
; often to create the FOTD images.  I returned to CrazyMidgets to 
; check its efficiency.  What I found is that it draws images that 
; differ somewhat from those drawn by the MandAutoCritInZ formula. 
; With a little change in the parameters, today's image could have 
; been created with the present-day MandAutoCritInZ formula.  I 
; had an attack of laziness however that prevented me from trying.
; 
; Today's image is a hole-filled moth-eaten one that, due to the 
; very narrow color palette, exceeds expectations.  Considering 
; all aspects of the image and formula, I rated the image at an 
; everyday 7 -- not bad, but nothing to get excited about either.
; 
; The parent fractal is crazy enough even without considering the 
; name of the generating formula.  I'll not try to describe this 
; parent since it is so easily checked.
; 
; The name "One Testy Minibrot" indicates that the generating 
; formula is only a test on the way to the final version.  Or it 
; could mean that the minibrot is in a cranky mood.
; 
; The calculation time of 3 minutes is brief enough to keep 
; everyone happy.  The hassle of setting up and running a 
; parameter file may be avoided by visiting the web sites.
; 
; The official FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; I might soon write an introduction to the world of fractals and 
; post it to the official FOTD web site.  It would mean a week or 
; two break in the (almost) daily string of FOTD's.
; 
; High-definition versions of the images are posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The past FOTD images are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Heat prevailed here at Fractal Central today, with full sun and 
; a temperature of 91F 33C.  The cooling showers hinted at for the 
; evening failed to arrive.  The fractal cats, being inside cats, 
; had no trouble with the outside conditions.  They did get cranky 
; however when we failed to set up their cube complex.  The humans 
; had a lazy day.  The next FOTD will be posted before very long.  
; Until then, take care, and let's elect a Mandelbrot fractal as 
; our next president.  There would be no noticeable change and we 
; could always blame it on the Julia fractals.
