; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- June 26, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image consists of two oversized 
; and partially merged Mandelbrot sets.  And to the west, 
; extending far beyond the merged M-sets, lies an even larger 
; ring, which I have not yet explored.  Today's image lies on the 
; eastern side of the parent, in a valley that is almost but not 
; quite an East Valley.
; 
; I rated the image at a not-too-bad 7.5, 1/2 point of which is a 
; bonus for the coloring.  The name "Purple Squigglies" refers to 
; the prominent magenta-ish features scattered throughout the 
; scene.
; 
; A minibrot does lie at the center, but the surrounding pattern 
; becomes too chaotic well before the minibrot is reached.  The 
; actual magnitude of over 3-1/2 million is effectively greater 
; that it appears due to the tremendous size of the parent, which 
; shifts the decimal point of the calculating math routine, making 
; things appear as though they were several orders of magnitude 
; deeper than they actually are.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes will pass in two flashes 
; and result in an image that inspires awe and wonder.
; 
; The flashes may be avoided by checking the finished image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The awe will be increased by viewing the hi-def rendering at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Extra wonder may be found at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where all the past FOTD images and discussions are posted.
; 
; Except for the lack of morning rain, today was a repeat of 
; yesterday here at Fractal Central, with a very scenic mix of sun 
; and clouds, a brisk breeze, and a high temperature of 75F 24C.
; 
; The fractal cats and fractal humans both had a reasonable day, 
; the cats with their cat cubes, the humans with work that went 
; well.  The next FOTD will be posted in the near future.  (Read 
; 'near' as 'around 24 hours'.)  Until next time, take care, and 
; why do people have no fear of falling when they are dreaming of 
; flying high above the ground with nothing but their weightless 
; bodies to hold them aloft?
