; FOTD -- October 16, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image came about when I combined Z^2 with 0.2 parts of 
; Z^3 on each iteration before adding a very unusual log(c).  
; Since the MandAutoCritInZ formula is meant to produce Mandelbrot 
; images, we are actually using the logarithm of the pixel.
; 
; The resulting parent fractal is little more than a tiny series 
; of bays spread along the X-axis.  Today's scene is located in 
; the East Valley area of a prominent minibrot just north of one 
; of these bays.
; 
; The name "Forever Onward" suggests the unending detail of 
; fractals.
; 
; The rating of a solid 8 owes a full point to the coloring, which 
; I spent nearly an hour getting almost just right.  The image is 
; one of those rare ones in which a negative logmap gives the best 
; coloring.
; 
; The calculation time of 45 minutes is excessively slow, but 
; luckily, viewing the image on one of the web sites will reduce 
; the delay of enjoyment notably.
; 
; The finished image is online at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition rendering is available at:

; 
; The FOTD back images are posted at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Pleasant autumn weather prevailed here at Fractal Central today, 
; with partly cloudy skies and a high of 59F 15C.  The remaining 
; fractal cat, Nicholas, passed most of the day on the shelf in 
; the southwest window, watching the world go by, probably remem-
; bering Cassie.
; 
; When Cassie was here she would sometimes hide, then suddenly 
; dash out and surprise Nicholas, causing him to leap into the 
; air and get a bristled tail.  Monday evening while Nicholas was 
; walking peacefully down the hall, he suddenly leaped into the 
; air and his tail bristled as though Cassie had just surprised 
; him.  Science (at least the skeptics) says there are no such 
; things as ghosts, much less cat ghosts.  They say belief in 
; unseen things such as ghosts is an outdated superstition carried 
; over from a less enlightened era.  Apparently Nicholas has not 
; heard the news however.
; 
; The humans made it through the day with nothing going wrong, 
; which is easier said than done.  The next FOTD will be posted 
; whenever it is posted.  Until whenever arrives, take care, and 
; if I had created the world, I certainly could have done a better 
; job.
