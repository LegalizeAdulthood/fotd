; FOTD -- October 08, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Terminus".  The word implies an ending, 
; and as far as I know, today's fractal might be the final FOTD.  
; On Saturday, fractal cat Cassie was a little lazy.  On Sunday 
; morning she was gasping for breath.  When we rushed her to the 
; doctor, he said she had severe pneumonia and put her on oxygen, 
; but he told us she probably would not make it.  When the phone 
; rang at 2:30 last night, we knew what it meant.
; 
; Enough said about that, but with no fractal cat activity to 
; comment on, I now see little reason to continue finding and 
; writing about the simple basic fractals I have been finding in 
; my daily searches, which have fascinated me for the past 15 
; years but were hardly considered great even when I began posting 
; them.
; 
; For several years, as has been obvious from my closing comments, 
; my interest has been shifting from fractals-101 more to philoso-
; phy, science, religion and the human condition.  I might combine 
; my thoughts and expand them into a book.  If I continue with 
; fractals, I might pick up one of the fast modern-day S.O.T.A. 
; machines and join the legion of fractal fans trying, usually 
; futilely, to make a bit of money from fractal stuff such as 
; giant posters, t-shirts, bags, stained glass, coffee mugs, etc.
; 
; One thing certain however is that I will continue reading and 
; posting comments to the list.  If I turn up any truly great 
; fractals, I will post them, with or without comments.
; 
; Today's image, which rates a 7-1/2, lies in the parent that 
; results when 2 parts of Z^(-2.2) are combined with 0.2 parts of 
; Z^(-12.2) and (1/C) is added on each iteration.  This parent 
; resembles a partially obscured 3-leaf clover, with today's image 
; located in a tiny bud on the southern shore line of the eastern 
; bay.
; 
; The calculation time of 5-3/4 minutes is a bit slow, but hey!, 
; you would not want to miss what could be the final FOTD image.  
; The web sites will make the viewing notably easier.
; 
; The completed image is online at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-defenition rendering is at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The entire FOTD library is at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A chilly cloudy day prevailed here at Fractal central today.  
; The temperature topped out at 54F 12C.  With the loss of one 
; fractal cat, the humans had a dejected day.  The next FOTD might 
; eventually be posted, but that day is not yet in sight.  Until 
; then, if ever, take care, put on those rose-colored glasses and 
; look for the bright side.
