; FOTD -- October 21, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For years I was disappointed with the higher order fractal 
; images, especially the minibrots, which to me at least, with a 
; few minor differences, all look the same.
; 
; Then, totally by accident, I stumbled upon the DivideBrot series 
; of formulas.  These formulas somehow combine higher order 
; energies with quadratic energies in such a way that the higher 
; order energies affect only the deeper sections of the fractals.
; 
; Today's image is a typical scene quite deep in its parent 
; fractal, which on the surface is an everyday Mandelbrot set.  We 
; need to go only a small distance down into the parent before we 
; spot trouble however.  The large minibrot on the main stem is 
; already breaking up, its main bay filling with debris.  Today's 
; image lies in the debris strewn about the northeast part of its 
; main bay.
; 
; I rated the image at an 8, mostly because the prominent order-7 
; minibrot at the center is one of the most unusual high-order 
; minibrots I have yet found.  I might have added a half-point for 
; the coloring, but a second thought said the present rating is 
; high enough.
; 
; The name "Coma Fractrailis" is an invented phony latin phrase, 
; which is supposed to mean 'fractal with commas'.  The seven 
; elements arranged around the minibrot strongly resemble commas.
; 
; The calculation time of one minute will be faster on modern SOTA 
; machines and slower on older ones.  All timing uncertainty may 
; be eliminated however by checking the web sites.
; 
; View the image without the effort of calculating it by visiting 
; the FOTD web site at:

; 
; A mix of sun and clouds, and a temperature of 61F 16C, made 
; conditions near ideal here at Fractal central today.  Fractal 
; Nicholas appreciated both the warm sun on the shelf in the 
; southwest window and the blowing leaves, which are still 
; falling.  It was apparent however that he missed Cassie sitting 
; nearby.
; 
; The fractal people had a not-too-cheery day.  It's still rather 
; glum here at FC with only one lonely cat trying to keep things 
; active.  The next FOTD will be posted before too much time 
; passes.  Until whenever, take care, and look to the light.
