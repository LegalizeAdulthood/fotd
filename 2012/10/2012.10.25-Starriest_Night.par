; FOTD -- October 25, 2012 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal rates an honest 9.5.  A full point and a half is 
; due to the coloring, which is about all the image has going for 
; it.
; 
; The scene lies in the parent fractal that comes about when the 
; Mandelbrot set is corrupted with Z^(0.94145506) energies.  This 
; parent is mostly cut-off beyond the too-small escape radius.  
; What shows of it is shaped like a large teardrop.  A larger 
; escape radius would have revealed more of the parent, but would 
; have lost today's scene.
; 
; The sky part of the image is all outside stuff made visible by 
; the 'bof60' outside fill.  The lower part is everyday inside 
; stuff.
; 
; The name "Starriest Night" was inspired by a well known painting.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/2 minutes will pass slowly at first, 
; but will speed up notably once the calculation reaches the 
; distant horizon about 2/3 of the way down.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition rendering plus other goodies is online at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The FOTD back images are available at:
;

; 
; Heavy clouds permitted only a few peeks of sun at Fractal 
; Central today.  The temperature of 66F 19C was all right, but it 
; would have been more enjoyable if there had been more sun.  
; Fractal cat Nicholas spent most of the afternoon on the shelf in 
; the southwest window, waiting for the sun that never came.  The 
; humans made it through the day as best they could.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted soon.  Until whenever, take care, and who 
; said fractals cannot be art?
