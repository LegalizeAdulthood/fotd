; FOTD -- October 22, 2012 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The very first FOTD image was posted 15 years ago on April 11, 
; 1997.  It was named "Snaketree".  Today's image is a slight 
; reworking of that old image.
; 
; In an attempt to improve the original image, I zoomed in on the 
; central tree and recolored it.  The result IMO is a somewhat 
; improved image, with more contrast and a more prominent center 
; of attention.
; 
; The name "Snake Resurrection" has nothing to do with snakes 
; rising from the dead.  It is simply a comment on the nature of 
; the image.
; 
; Way back in the prehistoric era of 1997 I wrote a new formula 
; for each image, giving the formula the same name as the image.  
; Thus today's fractal is the only image ever created by the 
; SnakeTree formula, which calculates (-Z)^(1.095) then adds 3.4 
; instead of (C) on each iteration.  
; 
; The image is a fast one, finishing in its full glory in a modest 
; 33 seconds.  The glory is gloriously reflected on the FOTD web 
; sites.
; 
; The glorious finished image is online at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A super-glorious high-definition rendering is available at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The back images are online in total glory at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today was absolutely perfect here at Fractal Central.  The 
; temperature of 68F 20C was perfect, the cloudless sky was 
; perfect, and the gentle wind from the west was perfect.  The 
; only improvement I could think of would have been a few puffy 
; clouds to add interest.  Fractal cat Nicholas spent a good part 
; of the afternoon in the sun on his shelf.  The humans simply 
; spent the afternoon.  The next FOTD, maybe a trip into the FOTD 
; past, maybe not, will be posted when it is ready.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and let's all drive to Syracuse to join the 
; protest against the obscene profits the greedy big oil companies 
; are making from their unfair gasoline prices.
