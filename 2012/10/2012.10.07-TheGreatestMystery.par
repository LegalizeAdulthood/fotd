; FOTD -- October 06, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Fractals are one of the greatest mysteries, but perhaps the 
; greatest mystery of all is the human brain, which by some 
; strange coincidence is brought to mind by today's image.
; 
; The other day on one of those pop-neuro-science shows on TV, I 
; heard the statement that 'you are your brain'.  This sounds 
; harmless enough as long as one does not think too deeply about 
; it, but the deeper one thinks, the less sense the statement 
; makes.  If I *am* my brain, as neuro-science claims, and I 
; *have* a brain, which is a fact, then it is stated that my brain 
; has a brain, which makes no sense at all, since there is only 
; one brain.  Just what is this mysterious 'I' that has a brain?  
; Maybe the implication is that the 'I' in question is a mere 
; illusion generated by my brain, which would mean the illusion 
; has a brain.  Or maybe the illusion is having an illusion of 
; having a brain.  Or maybe we should simply state that my brain 
; *is* my brain.  Where the heck has reality gone?  I thought 
; science was based on reason and common sense.
; 
; Until neuro-science can get its act together and make clear the 
; process of the generation of self-awareness from unconscious 
; meat, the brain will likely remain the greatest mystery.  Since 
; today's image rather resembles a brain, I have named it "The 
; Greatest Mystery".
; 
; Almost as non-sensical as the world of neuro-science is the 
; world of the fourth spatial dimension, which exists in the world 
; of mathematics, though not in the world of 'reality', makes even 
; less sense.  Today's image is a near-Julia scene along the 
; X-axis at the eastern edge of the main bay of the (-Z)^(2.5)+C 
; Mandeloid.  It is a four-dimensional scene, since it is double-
; rotated 1 degree and 1 degree from the exact Julia orientation, 
; and double rotation (around two totally perpendicular axis 
; planes) is not possible in 3-D space.
; 
; The image, with its two hemispheres, is very close to being a 
; fractal tree.  A different view might have made it a tree.  But 
; it is not quite close enough to justify a tree-like name.
; 
; Even with all the image's color and all the reality and illusion 
; talk, I could give the image a rating no higher than a 7.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/4 minutes is within reason, though 
; the web sites are more reasonable.
; 
; For total reason, check the finished image online at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A rendering in hi-def is available at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The back images are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Clouds, occasional showers and a cooler temperature of 63F 17C 
; prevailed here at Fractal Central today.  The fractal cats 
; checked the conditions early, then decided to take it easy.  
; With FL feeling a bit under the weather, the humans simply took 
; it easy.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a reasonable time.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and the distance between two objects is 
; determined by the amount of empty space between them.  But empty 
; space is nothing, so how is it possible to have more or less of 
; nothing?
