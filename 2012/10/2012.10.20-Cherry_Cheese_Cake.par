; FOTD -- October 20, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us into a Mandelbrot set corrupted in its 
; depths by Z^10 energies, where we check a tiny minibrot on the 
; main stem, some distance east of the large minibrot.  This tiny 
; minibrot is just starting to change from quadratic to order-10.  
; The change is visible as bits of debris that have just appeared 
; in the normally open areas of the main bay and bud.  Today's 
; scene lies in a kind of island that has arisen from the sea in 
; the northern part of the main bay.
; 
; The most unusual thing in the image is the unexpected patterns 
; surrounding the satellite minibrots.  We like to think of the 
; higher-order fractals as being 'all the same', but today's image 
; shows that, when combined with the Mandelbrot set, higher-order 
; images can produce some quite unusual scenes.
; 
; The name "Cherry Cheese-Cake" came about when I noticed the 
; colors of the main central ring.  The rating of an 8 includes 
; the usual bonus for my coloring, which in today's image is 
; perhaps a bit over-rated.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-5/6 minutes is a reasonable price to 
; pay for today's image, which will certainly surprise those who 
; expect nothing but a lot of moth-eaten circles in an image with 
; so much Z^10 energy.
; 
; The finished image is posted online and ready to deliver the 
; surprise at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A rendering in high-definition is available at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The FOTD back images are posted at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today began with clouds here at Fractal Central.  The clouds 
; hung on until midday, when the sun suddenly burst through, 
; bringing a glorious end to the day.  The temperature of 59F 15C 
; was a bit hard to enjoy due to the clouds.  Nicholas the cat 
; spent a good part of the day watching falling leaves.  He also 
; had several bouts of dashing up and down the long hallway, just 
; as he did when Cassie was here to chase him.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted when the time is right.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and if Nicholas continues chasing and being 
; chased by something invisible, I might have to admit that cat 
; spirits do indeed exist.  My credulity should not be so shocking 
; to fractal rationalists however, since I have already stated 
; that information can travel backward in time, as it did during 
; the week preceeding 9-11, and therefore, at least one paranormal 
; phenomenon, (precognition), is true.
