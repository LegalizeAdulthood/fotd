; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- March 25, 2012 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD is late.  The reason is that there were so many 
; other tasks waiting to be done here at Fractal Central that I 
; had no time to prepare and post the image on schedule.  To get 
; the FOTD up to date, there will be no FOTD for March 26.
; 
; Today's image is a scene deep in the FOTD image of two days ago, 
; March 23, which is located in the Seahorse Valley of the largest 
; minibrot in the north period-3 filament network.
; 
; Other than the coloring, the greatest interest lies in the fine 
; example of anti-bifurcation the image displays.  The number of 
; elements doubles and gets cut in half in a most unpredictable 
; manner as the central minibrot is approached.
; 
; The image earns the rating of an 8-1/2 because of this anti-
; bifurcation and also because of the spectacular emerald 
; coloring.  The name "The Emerald Path" is a comment on the color 
; palette.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/4 hours indicates that the image 
; lies well within the range of arbitrary precision math.  In 
; cases like this, the FOTD web sites perform their greatest 
; service by making the finished image available online almost 
; instantly.
; 
; To avoid the excessive calculation time, view the finished image 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition version of the image is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The past FOTD images may be seen at:

; 
; A cloudy morning here at Fractal Central today gave way to some 
; sun in the afternoon, but the clouds returned in the evening, 
; ending the day on a somber note.  The fractal cats would have 
; preferred a temperature warmer than the 61F 16C, but took what 
; they got without complaint.  The humans had a day of recovery 
; from the day before.  The next FOTD is due to be posted about 32 
; hours from now.  The odds are it will make it.  Until whenever, 
; take care, and when you dream that you are dreaming, are you 
; really dreaming?
