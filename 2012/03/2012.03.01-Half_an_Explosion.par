; FOTD -- March 01, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Half an Explosion".  I gave it this name 
; for two reasons: first, because the explosion is divided into 
; two distinct halves; second, because it is a tweaking of an 
; image that appeared several years ago, and is therefore only 
; half new.
; 
; The parent fractal is an oversized thing consisting of two large 
; bays with a large ring off to the northeast.  This ring is 
; surrounded by smaller rings, with today's scene located in one 
; of these smaller rings.
; 
; The half-and-half effect was created by carefully tweaking the 
; escape radius, set by imag(p3), until the cutoff point slices 
; through the center of the minibrot.  The effect in the left half 
; of the image was created by rendering the scene with the inside 
; set to 'atan'; the right half consists of normal equal-iteration 
; outside stuff.
; 
; I rated the image at an 8 even though it is kind of a repeat.  
; In my opinion, its half-and-half effect justifies such a rating. 
; (I sometimes return to past images to see what I can find new in 
; them.)
; 
; The calculation time of 55 seconds is blazingly fast.  And even 
; the slight annoyance of setting up and running the parameter 
; file may be avoided by viewing the finished image on the FOTD 
; web sites.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is at:

; 
; The entire library of past images is available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The first day of March here at Fractal Central began with fog 
; and heavy clouds.  The fog thinned and the sky brightened as the 
; day progressed, but the clouds hung on and the conditions never 
; reached what could be called pleasant, despite the temperature 
; of 48F +9C, which was mild for the season.  Early in the day the 
; fractal cats gave up waiting for the sun, and spent the rest of 
; the time snuggled in the warmest places they could find.
; 
; The humans had a normal dull day, (which does not mean boring).  
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and how can we consider the visible material universe to 
; be any kind of ultimate reality when all we know of it is 
; inferred from images created in our minds -- images that we now 
; know reflect only about five percent of all that exists.
