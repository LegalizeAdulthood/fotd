; FOTD -- March 07, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "Purple Pilgrimage", a phrase that appears 
; to have deep meaning but actually means nothing.
; 
; The generating formula subtracts Z^(-0.5) from Z^(1.5) on each 
; iteration before adding (1/C).  This unlikely expression creates 
; no single parent fractal, but rather a field of scattered debris 
; filled with tiny Mandelbrot sets.  Two relatively large M-sets 
; dominate the field, with today's scene located near the east 
; valley of the smaller of the two.
; 
; The scattered-debris appearance of the parent fractal is 
; reflected in the pattern surrounding the tiny minibrot at the 
; center of today's image.  This debris is filled with even tinier 
; minibrots, etc., etc., all the way to infinity.  Unfortunately, 
; all these even tinier minibrots are well beyond resolution, at 
; least in the present-day Fractint for DOS.
; 
; I rated the image at a 7, which is FOTD average.  The main 
; drawback is the colors, which are brilliant enough, but at least 
; in my opinion, do not blend together harmoniously enough for a 
; higher rating.
; 
; The calculation time of 45 seconds is only a slight delay.  This 
; delay in finding satisfaction may be avoided however by visiting 
; the FOTD web sites.
; 
; For maximum convenience, the finished image is available on the 
; official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is available at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The entire library of images is online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Near total sun and a temperature of 61F 16C made today the most 
; spring-like so far this year here at Fractal Central.  The 
; fractal cats took to their sunny shelf in the southwest window, 
; and with the house heat turned off, stayed there all afternoon.
; 
; The humans, FL and I, after agreeing to disagree on a couple 
; minor political points, had an uneventful day of doing the 
; commercial work and working on fractals.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and it's tough 
; having a middle-of-the-road political view in a world of social 
; progressives and religious fundamentalists.
