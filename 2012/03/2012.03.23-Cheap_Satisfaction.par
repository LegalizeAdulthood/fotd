; 
; FOTD -- March 23, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Cheap Satisfaction".  Unfortunately, the 
; word 'cheap' often implies a lack of quality, so "Less Expensive 
; Satisfaction" might have been a better name.  This name would 
; not have fit into the 18-character space however.
; 
; The less-expensiveness refers to the parent fractal -- the one 
; and only Mandelbrot set, which in the Fractint program has been 
; programmed for top speed, and despite its almost hackneyed 
; familiarity, still holds an infinity of unseen images.  An image 
; such as today's, with its calculation time of under 15 seconds, 
; must certainly be considered cheap.
; 
; The unusually rich minibrot in the image lies in a spiral in a 
; mini Julia set on a filament in the south branch of the Seahorse 
; Valley of the large minibrot on the west branch of the filament 
; extending from the large period-3 bud on the north shore of the 
; main bay of the Mandelbrot set.  (Try to read this aloud without 
; taking a breath.)
; 
; I might have given the image a rating a point or so higher 
; than the 7-1/2, but when I saw the final fractal, the colors 
; impressed me as being somehow too busy and overly gaudy.
; 
; One thing that no one can complain about however is the 
; calculation time, which even at the indicated 15 seconds is far 
; too slow.  On many machines the image will be finished before 
; the monitor can switch to super-vga mode -- an incredibly small 
; price to pay for any fractal.
; 
; For satisfaction that is even less expensive, check the finished 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; For more intense, equally inexpensive satisfaction, check the 
; high-definition version at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; All the thousands of past FOTD images and discussions are 
; available online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day began with fog here at Fractal Central, giving the 
; impression of a dreary day to come, but by late morning the fog 
; cleared off, leading to a very pleasant afternoon with lots of 
; hazy sun and a summer-like temperature of 79F 26C.  The fractal 
; cats enjoyed the sun while the humans, who were too busy to 
; enjoy the sun, merely observed it.
; 
; The next FOTD is due to be posted in 24 hours.  But tomorrow is 
; Saturday, and the Saturday FOTD's are often rather late, so 
; there is no guarantee of promptness.  Until then, take care, and 
; strive to bring justice to others, but don't expect to receive 
; it in return.
