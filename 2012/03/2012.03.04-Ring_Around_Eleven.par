; FOTD -- March 03, 2012 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a hastily done tweaking of an image originally 
; posted several years ago.  Since it is a re-used image, I could 
; rate it no higher than a 6.  But the image is not as poor as the 
; rating implies.  The colors have been improved and the cropping 
; changed, making it at least a pseudo-new image.
; 
; On its surface, the parent fractal is a Mandelbrot set, while in 
; its depths it is an order-11 fractal.  Today's scene lies on a 
; side shoot of the western branch of the filament extending from 
; the large northern bud of the parent M-set.  It is located a 
; short distance east of the East Valley of the large minibrot on 
; the filament.
; 
; The image clearly shows the 4-way quadratic symmetry around the 
; outer part of the fractal, while the inner part shows order-11 
; symmetry.  The 4-way symmetry is imperfect however.  A close 
; examination of the four outer filamentary complexes reveals 
; small irregularities, the most obvious of which are the 9 small 
; white dots surrounding the outer edge of the donut ring.  I have 
; no idea how the number 9 fits into the mathematics of the image. 
; All I can make of it is that the number 9 lies between 4 and 11. 
; (Inside the donut ring, all is in order, with the proper 11 
; white dots.)
; 
; The name "Ring Around Eleven" refers to the fractal ring 
; encircling the minibrot at the center, looking almost like a 
; bluish donut divided into 11 raspberry-filled segments.
; 
; The image might not be a fully new one, but it is still worth 
; the thrifty 30 seconds required to finish the calculation and 
; stand in awe of the image.
; 
; The official FOTD web site with the already calculated image may 
; be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image is posted in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The entire collection of FOTD back images is at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day began cloudy here at Fractal Central, but patches of 
; blue appeared by mid-morning, and by noon it was sunny.  The 
; temperature of a mild 54F 12C would have given a preview of 
; spring if the winds had not been so brisk.  The fractal cats 
; presumably spent the afternoon in the sun.
; 
; The humans spent the afternoon at a very atmospheric antique 
; emporium.  By the time we left the shop, we were rather spaced 
; out by the intense aura radiating from the genuine 200-year-old 
; stuff we saw there.  We are now un-spaced, so the next FOTD, the 
; one for March 5, will be posted in 24 hours.  There will be no 
; FOTD for March 4.  Until then, take care, and Einstein claimed 
; that God does not play dice with the universe.  But then, who 
; was Einstein to tell God what to do?  (Einstein has since been 
; proved wrong.  It appears that God does play dice.)
