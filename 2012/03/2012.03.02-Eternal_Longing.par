; FOTD -- March 02, 2012 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The name of today's image came about when I watched a program on 
; the Science Channel last evening about the possibility of human-
; ity gaining physical immortality through science and advanced 
; technology, which is the only kind of immortality Atheists and 
; skeptics can believe in.  (The faithful need no technological 
; miracles.  They already have the immortality of their eternal 
; souls.)
; 
; The TV program presented several ways physical immortality might 
; be achieved, none of which, in my opinion, have a ghost of a 
; chance of working ;-) .  But the program did reveal the deep 
; longing in the human spirit for something more than the few 
; morsels of satisfaction we might manage to dredge up in this 
; meager and ultimately meaningless lifetime.  The name of today's 
; image is "Eternal Longing", which recognizes this instinctive 
; sense of something missing.
; 
; In my imagination, I saw the image as a gateway to whatever one 
; might suppose comes after their final breath.  The fact that I 
; showed light instead of darkness on the other side of the 
; doorway could be a hint of my own personal beliefs, though I 
; doubt that any Atheist or deeply religious person would agree 
; with my view of things.
; 
; The image is a scene in the (-Z)^(1.234)+C Julibrot, sliced at 
; an angle double rotated halfway from the Mandelbrot to the Julia 
; orientations.  (Double rotation can happen only in 4-D hyper-
; space when a 4-D object rotates around a point.)
; 
; I gave the image no rating, since it is another blast from the 
; past, transferred from an early experimental 4-D formula to the 
; SliceJulibrot5 formula that I use today.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/3 minutes is quite brief, certainly 
; much shorter than eternity.
; 
; The day began sunny enough here at Fractal Central, but the 
; clouds thickened as morning progressed, and by midday it was 
; obvious that the fine weather would not last.  By afternoon it 
; had turned into another cloudy day, with a forecast of rain to 
; soon arrive.  The temperature of 50F 10C was pleasant enough for 
; the fractal cats, who never concern themselves about what comes 
; next, and seemed to know early that they would not have all the 
; sun they would have liked.
; 
; The humans had an average day, which probably seemed quite satis-
; factory to the cats.  The next FOTD is due in 24 hours, but 
; tomorrow is Saturday, and antiquing expeditions do happen on 
; Saturdays, so if the FOTD doesn't appear until Sunday, don't be 
; concerned.  Until whenever, take care, and at the quantum level, 
; two mutually exclusive things can both be true at the same time, 
; so maybe, in some way we cannot understand, the scientific view 
; of no hereafter and the religious view of heaven (or whatever) 
; are both correct.
