; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- March 21, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The FOTD is late again.  So what else is new?
; 
; Today's image is named "Cat's Cradle".  I gave it this name when 
; the intricate network of filaments reminded me of the string-
; between-the-fingers pastime that so often kept me occupied as a 
; child, when I had nothing else to do and had not even imagined 
; fractals.
; 
; The scene lies on the X-axis of its parent fractal, which is a 
; Mandelbrot set so infected with Z^3 energies that even on its 
; surface it is beginning to change into a cubic Mandeloid.  The 
; exact location is inside a valley that juts from the west into 
; the second bud out the X-axis.
; 
; There is little else to say about the image except to invite all 
; fractal fans to sit back and enjoy it.
; 
; The rating of a 7.5 has been raised from the 7 of an earlier 
; version of the same image, which I changed because it had too 
; much of a sickly green hue to it. 
; 
; The calculation time of a mere 20 seconds will pass in a flash, 
; but the resulting image will be fully gratifying.
; 
; Find instant gratification on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Exult in the glories of the high-definition version online at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The entire collection of back images is online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A pleasant mix of puffy clouds and brilliant sun made today an 
; enjoyable one here at Fractal Central.  The temperature of 70F 
; 21C fully pleased the fractal cats, who spent the afternoon 
; lounging in the sunlight.  The humans had a day of minor 
; political disagreement over what to do about the high cost of 
; energy.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 12 hours, give or take a few.  
; Until then, take care, and let's stop complaining about minor 
; things like gay people getting married and the damage being done 
; by hydraulic fracking, and start worrying about huge things like 
; the potentially deadly pollution caused by motor vehicle exhaust 
; in the large cities.  (And I'm still searching for proof that 
; the radiation emitted by cell-phone towers and by the wireless 
; devices that are used addictively by so many children is totally 
; safe.)
