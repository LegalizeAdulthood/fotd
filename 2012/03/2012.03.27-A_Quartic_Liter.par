; FOTD -- March 27, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image exists in an oversized parent Mandelbrot set with 
; quartic corruption in its depths.  The image lies in a patch of 
; left-over debris inside the main bay of the first large minibrot 
; beyond the very large minibrot on the main spike of the 
; near-perfect parent M-set.
; 
; The central 8-lobed object with the large triangular minibrot in 
; its center is filled with smaller similar minibrots.  It is also 
; filled with peaks and ridges of anti-bifurcation, though none of 
; these appear prominently in the image.
; 
; I whimsically named the image "A Quartic Liter" because there is 
; more to a liter than a quart -- about 1-3/4 ounces in fact.  The 
; rating of a 7 means that I consider the image's worth to be very 
; close to average.  Luckily, the calculation time of just under 2 
; minutes is also very close to average.
; 
; The finished image may be viewed on the official FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; without worrying about averages.
; 
; A high-definition version of the image may be viewed at:

; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; All the past FOTD images and discussions are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day began with clear skies but a frosty temperature of 25F 
; -4C here at Fractal Central.  Once the sun got to work however, 
; things warmed to a much more pleasant though still chilly 
; temperature of 48F +9C.  The fractal cats found some comfort in 
; the afternoon sun, which because of its increasing angle is 
; falling on an ever shrinking inside area.
; 
; The humans, FL and I, had an average day, with nothing happening 
; that was worth mentioning.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and if a person does not want a 
; thing to be true, he simply denies it exists, and if enough 
; people believe him, the thing does not exist.  It's magic!
