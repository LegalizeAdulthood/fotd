; FOTD -- March 08, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the same field of debris that served as 
; the parent fractal of yesterday's image.  The name "Deep in the 
; Debris" describes the location of today's image, which lies in 
; the Seahorse Valley area of one of the countless tiny minibrots 
; that fill the debris field.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is nothing exceptional, but it is all I could 
; do for an image that is a near repeat of yesterday's, and shares 
; the same flaws.  Today's image even reuses yesterday's color 
; palette.
; 
; To me, the colors appear chaotic and disorganized.  If I had put 
; more effort into the coloring, I might have raised the image to 
; a rating of an 8.  I saw too little potential in it however to 
; make the effort.
; 
; The calculation time of 6-1/4 minutes definitely drags.  Viewing 
; the image on the web sites is far more efficient.
; 
; The finished image may be viewed very efficiently, and without 
; the need of calculation, on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site is available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; This morning was sunny here at Fractal Central, but clouds moved 
; in at midday, and by the time the sun would have struck the 
; fractal cats' shelf, it had hidden itself behind the clouds, 
; making the cats grow sulky.  And then, light showers moved in 
; during the late afternoon.  The salvation was the unusually warm 
; temperature of 68F 20C, which kept the day from being a total 
; loss.
; 
; FL and I had an average day, with nothing out of the ordinary to 
; report.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and I see that a certain radio commentator is in 
; trouble again.  As for me, I believe in the right of free speech 
; -- as long I approve of the things the speaker is free to say.
