; 
; FOTD -- January 30, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in an oversized Mandelbrot set that has been 
; corrupted in its depths by Z^15 energies.  The exact location is 
; on the northeast shore line of the first significant minibrot 
; out the main stem of the parent Mandeloid.  This minibrot is 
; well on the way of morphing into a Z^15 one.
; 
; I named the image "Nest of Iterations" because for a moment it 
; reminded me of a bird's nest.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 is just far enough above average to make 
; the calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes worth the wait.
; 
; To avoid all waiting, check the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted.
; 
; A high-definition version of the image is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And don't forget the original FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today turned out mostly sunny for a change here at Fractal 
; Central; and the fractal cats made the most of things by 
; spending the entire afternoon in the southwest window, enjoying 
; the sun, which grows stronger every day.  The temperature of 36F 
; +2C was chilly, but nowhere close to the cold that we often 
; experience here in Central Pennsylvania at the end of January.
; 
; The humans, (at least that's what they say we are), spent the 
; day pondering the bills, which is a very human thing to do.  The 
; fractal cats, by comparison, never worry about bills.  The next 
; FOTD is due to be posted in 24 hours, and unless something 
; unexpected happens, it will be posted on schedule.  Until then, 
; take care, and imagine that all the material in the universe 
; vanished, leaving a vast three-dimensional emptiness.  Now try 
; to imagine that the empty space vanished.  Could the fact that 
; mentally eliminating the empty space is so much more difficult 
; indicate that empty 3-D space is merely a state of consciousness 
; -- the blank screen of the mind perhaps?
