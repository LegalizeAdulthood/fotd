; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- January 21, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's FOTD I have infected an oversized Mandelbrot set with 
; some Z^8 stuff and checked its huge East Valley to see what the 
; infection causes to happen there.
; 
; The first thing I discovered was that when order-8 minibrots mix 
; with quadratic ones, things work out nice and symmetrically 
; around the minibrots, with the powers-of-two series intact.
; 
; Today's image shows how neat and orderly things appear when 
; all the numbers fall compactly into place.  (Reduce the real(p1) 
; parameter to 7 and notice how quickly all that hard-earned 
; symmetry vanishes.)
; 
; I named the image "Eight Bells", which on a ship happens six 
; times a day.  I can give no logical reason for the name other 
; than a recognition of the order-8 stuff that has corrupted but 
; not diminished the large parent Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 might have been higher if I had had more 
; time to work on the coloring.  As it is, the colors are a bit 
; flat, but not so flat as to be boring.
; 
; The calculation time of just under 2 minutes will pass fast once 
; the detail starts to appear at the top of the frame.
; 
; But 2 minutes is still 2 minutes.  All tasks connected with 
; setting up and running the included parameter file may be 
; avoided however by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; or by viewing it in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site with all the images may be accessed 
; at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Snow began falling here at Fractal central during the night, and 
; by the time it ended in the late morning, about 7 inches, 18cm, 
; had piled up.  Luckily, the snow was very fluffy and cleared 
; away with almost no effort.  The fractal cats sent encouragement 
; from the window as I finished the sidewakl-cleraing job in less 
; than 20 minutes.  FL had the hot coffee waiting when I returned 
; inside.  The weather for the rest of the day was cloudy with a 
; temperature of 27F -3C.  The humans found a little relaxation at 
; a local antique mall.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and when all else fails, try the fractal diet.  It's 
; calorie-free and guaranteed to work.
