; 
; FOTD -- January 25, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a close-up of an order-10 minibrot that lies in 
; the west branch of the valley leading to the large north bud of 
; the large minibrot on the west branch of the filament extending 
; from the large north bud of its parent oversized and corrupted 
; Mandelbrot set.
; 
; Now that we know exactly where things lie, we can step back and 
; stare in awe at an order-10 minibrot seen close-up in its full 
; glory.  The name "The Glorious Ten" gives full recognition to 
; the minibrot, which, being of such a high order, would not be 
; expected to have such glory.
; 
; The rating of an 8 shows that I rather enjoy finding scenes of 
; such interest and delicacy where things would normally be 
; expected to start falling apart and looking 'all the same'.
; 
; The drawback to all this glory is the calculation time of 15 
; minutes, which is a rather inflated price to pay.  But here is 
; where the web sites ride to the rescue, fighting inflation.
; 
; The finished image is posted in its total glory at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is posted in even more glory at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD site with thousands of glorious images is at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Heavy clouds and a temperature of 41F +5C kept things looking 
; drab here at Fractal Central today.  The fractal cats waited 
; several hours for the sun to flood onto their shelf in the 
; southwest window.  When it never appeared, they decided to try 
; for an extra treat, which the humans did supply.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and climate change (aka global warming) is a recognized 
; fact.  We can do nothing to stop it, so what's behind all the 
; political debating?  My guess is that the evil big corporations 
; are somehow involved in it, and I wouldn't be surprised if our 
; alien overlords, the Annunaki from Sirius C, are behind it all.  
; How serious am I?  That's for me to know and others to guess, 
; but one thing always certain is that fractals do exist.
