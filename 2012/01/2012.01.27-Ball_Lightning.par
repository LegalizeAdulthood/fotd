; FOTD -- January 27, 2012 (Rating 8?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image gives a hint of the potential of the new 4-D 
; formula, which might or might not eventually live up to 
; expectations.
; 
; Sometimes when working with fractals the fractalist gets what he 
; expects; at other times he is totally surprised.  Today's image 
; is one of the total surprises.
; 
; The scene lies in the area of the large minibrot on the main 
; spike of the oversized and corrupted parent Mandelbrot set.  The 
; exact area is on the filament extending from the large north bud 
; of the minibrot, near the not-quite-reachable point where the 
; filament appears to suddenly narrow to a hairline.
; 
; The parent Mandelbrot set has been corrupted by Z^(101) energies 
; and enlarged 100 times, so that the corruption is invisible on 
; the surface, though it lurks very near visibility.  The angle of 
; the slice is so remote in hyperspace that even a hyper-human 
; would have trouble visualizing it.
; 
; The big surprise lies in the large circular object on the 
; lightning streak that slashes across the screen.  Never would 
; any sensible fractalist, (if any such an animal exists), expect 
; something like this in a fractal that on its surface is a large 
; Mandelbrot set, regardless of how corrupted the set may be in 
; its depths.
; 
; The name "Ball Lightning" was the first thing that came to mind 
; when I saw the scene, though I am not sure that the electrically-
; charged plasma phenomenon known as ball lightning has yet been 
; fully accepted in respectable conservative scientific circles.
; 
; The rating of an 8? indicates that, even though I think the 
; image is pretty good, I am not sure the wider fractal world will 
; think the same.
; 
; At any rate, the calculation time of a speedy 20 seconds will 
; keep the potential for disappointment at a minimum.
; 
; The finished image may be viewed online at:

; 
; The day began with clouds and light rain here at Fractal 
; Central.  The clouds broke by midday, leading to a partly 
; cloudy, windy afternoon with a temperature of 50F 10C.  The 
; fractal cats were annoyed by the on-and-off sunshine, and 
; finally found comfort by the heat, which, due to the mild 
; conditions, was off more than on.
; 
; The humans, FL and I had a day of routine activity.  The next 
; FOTD is scheduled to be posted in 24 hours.  But tomorrow is 
; Saturday, and expeditions of various kinds have a way of arising 
; unexpectedly on Saturdays, so there is no guarantee that it will 
; appear on time.  Until whenever, take care, and if nothing is 
; real, why then are we so concerned about reality?
