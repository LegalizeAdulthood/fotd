; FOTD -- January 20, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us into the depths of an oversized 
; Mandelbrot set that has been corrupted by order-17 stuff.  The 
; area we examine is the filament of the period-8 bud just west of 
; the large period-3 bud on the north shore of the M-set.  After 
; diving to a depth of over 4*(10^9) we come upon today's scene of 
; a perfect order-17 minibrot surrounded by the quadratic features 
; of its parent M-set.
; 
; The scene reminds me of the stuff such as scented candles, 
; feel-good slogans, teddy bears, New-Age supplies, etc. found in 
; one of those 'country gift' shops that have sprung up in the 
; abandoned downtown districts of many towns.  I think the general 
; name of this stuff is 'primitives'.  This pseudo-country stuff 
; is supposed to create a feeling of how we imagine it might have 
; felt living in the truly rural countryside about a century ago.
; 
; Longing for the truly better days of yore, I named the image 
; "Primitive Life".
; 
; After contemplating the image's pluses and minuses, I decided on 
; a rating of an everyday 7-1/2.  The calculation time of 2-2/3 
; minutes will pass in a flash and a half.
; 
; To avoid the flash, check the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Check it in high definition at:

; 
; Less than one inch, about 2cm, of snow fell here at Fractal 
; Central overnight Thursday, but it was enough to freshen up a 
; winter-weary world, as well as the fractal cats, who were 
; already fresh enough as it is.  Today's brilliant sunshine on 
; the fresh snow cover, as well as the temperature of 25F -4C, 
; kept spirits higher than they would otherwise have been.  The 
; forecast of heavier snow late tonight and tomorrow has the 
; shovels posted and ready to be grabbed.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and see you soon 
; with more goodies.
