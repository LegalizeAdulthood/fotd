; FOTD -- January 04, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's FOTD I break out the JimsCompMand formula that I 
; wrote quite a while ago as a generalization of the Fractint 
; type=cmplxmarksmand formula.  The JimsCompMand formula causes 
; fractals of any order to split apart along the negative X axis.
; 
; This splitting is especially interesting when applied to 
; fractals with an exponent of Z just a little under 2.  The 
; exponent of Z in today's image is 1.95, and normally the main 
; stem of the fractal it draws would have slipped off the screen 
; into some imaginary never-land.  One might assume that the stem 
; would be gone for good, but today's formula causes it to come 
; out of hiding and enter the world of the living.
; 
; The scene is located near the tip of a filament extending from 
; the north branch of Scepter Valley.
; 
; I named the image "Great Set of Stems" when I was struck by the 
; straightness of the 16 filaments extending from the central 
; minibrot, which is not quite perfectly resolved.  Because the 
; exponent is under 2, exactly 16 intact filaments are not all 
; there either, which is only to be expected.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is getting to be boring, but I have to rate 
; them as I see them.
; 
; The calculation time of a fireball 25 seconds will pass in a 
; flash, leaving hedonistic satisfaction in its wake.
; 
; Equal satisfaction may be found at:

; 
; And don't forget the high-definition version at:

; 
; The temperature rose from a morning low of 7F -14C here at 
; Fractal Central to an afternoon high of 23F -5C, while an 
; unbroken deck of clouds moved in by 10am and obscured the sun 
; for the rest of the day.  The cats of the fractal variety spent 
; the day seeking comfort, and finally found it on the shelf over 
; the radiator in the hallway.
; 
; The humans, if that's what we are, spent the day doing human 
; things such as paying bills of inhuman size.  The next FOTD will 
; be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and have critical 
; judgement when deciding which superstitions to believe.  Not all 
; superstitions are based on fact.
