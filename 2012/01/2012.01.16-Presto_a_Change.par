; FOTD -- January 16, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image treats us to a mixture of Z^2 and Z^67 elements.  
; The overall shape of the fractal is typical of the fractals 
; found near the large north and south buds of the Mandelbrot set, 
; while the shape of the minibrots themselves is that of the 
; 66-bayed minibrots in order-67 fractals, which usually consist 
; of little other than minibrots. 
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is a Mandelbrot set, hugely 
; enlarged, but with all its parts intact, at least on the 
; surface.
; 
; Today's scene is located near the west branch of the filament 
; extending from the large north bud of a tiny minibrot, which has 
; just begun to morph.  This minibrot lies not very far out on the 
; main spike of the parent Mandelbrot set.  The scene itself lies 
; at a magnitude depth well beyond the point where the minibrots 
; have morphed from quadratic to order-67.
; 
; The rating of a 7 seems appropriate for an image that resembles 
; some earlier FOTD images too closely.  I would have preferred 
; something a bit more unique.  Perhaps tomorrow, I'll find it.
; 
; The name "Presto-a-Change" is nothing more than the imaginary 
; 'magic' words that might be invented by some small child.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes is a little slow for 
; maximum happiness.
; 
; So to keep happiness at the maximum, view the finished image on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; To enter a state of total bliss, view the high-definition 
; version at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Then reminisce about the fractal days of long ago, by checking 
; the original FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today here at Fractal Central began sunny with a bone-chilling 
; temperature of 12F -14C.  By midday the strong sun had warmed 
; the air to a far more pleasant 36F +2C, but in the afternoon, a 
; wind sprang up, a heavy cloud layer moved in and the temperature 
; dropped back to freezing, with sleet threatening.  The fractal 
; cats took things in stride, though they would have preferred 
; more sun.  The humans had a busy enough day just being human.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  I think things are 
; settled enough for me to give assurance that it will appear on 
; schedule.  Until then, take care, and try to have your beliefs 
; straight.  Final exams are coming within a century.
