; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- January 26, 2012 (Rating 8?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; NEW FORMULA!
; 
; Giving in to curiosity, I spent most of the day writing a new 
; version of the SliceJulibrot formula, which applies the MultiExp 
; expression to the four-dimensional Julibrots it draws.  The 
; formula appears on the list today for the first time.
; 
; Getting the formula to work took up most of the day's fractal 
; time, so the image I finally found is not much of an example of 
; what the formula might be able to do.  Tomorrow's image should 
; be better however.
; 
; I named the image "A Strange Mini Indeed".  Actually, it's not a 
; minibrot, nor is it a Julia set.  It's a hybrid, sliced in the 
; Oblate direction, determined by the imag(C) and real(Z) axes.  
; Some directions in the image are Mandelbrot, others are Julia, 
; most are somewhere in between.
; 
; The parent fractal is an oversized Mandelbrot set corrupted in 
; its depths by order-7 energies.  Today's scene is located well 
; off to the side of the east edge of the large minibrot on the 
; main stem of the parent, in the real(Z) direction.
; 
; Some stretching and skewing was needed to eliminate the natural 
; distortion of the image.  This distortion exists in nearly all 
; the odd planes of the Julibrots, and can be only partially 
; eliminated by stretching trickery such as I used in today's 
; image.
; 
; The rating of an 8? is a guess, based on what the formula might 
; have in it.  The mathematical interest is there, though the 
; artistic worth of at least today's image leaves something to be 
; desired.
; 
; The calculation time of a speedy 38 seconds means that little 
; effort will have been wasted if the image lays an egg.
; 
; The task of setting up and calculating the parameter file may be 
; eliminated by surfing to the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; And while you're at it, check the hi-def version at:

; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Morning clouds led to afternoon rain here at Fractal Central 
; today.  The temperature of 39F +4C was mild enough to keep away 
; all danger of ice.  The fractal cats, who wish they had the 
; outdoor life of the old, now departed, fractal cats, would have 
; preferred more sun.  The humans, FL and I, simply made it 
; through another day, which sounds boring, but actually is not.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and everything looks richer in the fullness of four 
; dimensions.
