; FOTD -- January 18, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'm currently involved in trying to see what can be done with 
; minibrots of the higher orders.  In today's image I have taken a 
; minibrot of unlikely order 11 and mixed it with some Z^2 to 
; produce a picture I have named "Lurid Revelations".  Now don't 
; get worked up, it's not a scene from a cheap racy novel, it's a 
; lurid red fractal featuring a mighty Z^11 minibrot at the center.
; 
; As is true with so many of the fractals created by the MultiExp 
; formula, (which I am still working on), the parent fractal is an 
; oversized Mandelbrot set.  Today's scene is located on a 
; filament near the 'star' of the period-5 bud on the northwest 
; shore line of the oversized parent M-set.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is the most I could give the image.  The 
; colors are simply too sensationalized for the image to be rated 
; any higher.
; 
; But even a sensational scene is worth a look, so why not enjoy 
; the action by running the included parameter file.  When the 
; image is finished, you'll be glad you did.
; 
; Save time by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Become happier by viewing it in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And remember the classic FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today here at Fractal Central dawned with lots of clouds and a 
; mild temperature of 43F +6C.  The clouds cleared away by late 
; morning, leading to a mostly sunny afternoon, but at the same 
; time, a stiff breeze arose from the north, and by afternoon the 
; temperature had dropped to freezing and was continuing to fall.  
; The backward weather left the fractal cats puzzled.  They spent 
; an unusual amount of time on their sunny shelf, watching the 
; flurries of leaves scurry by.
; 
; The humans, who had an uneventful day, passed the time passing 
; the time.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and what is the name of the large island just 
; south of Antarctica?
