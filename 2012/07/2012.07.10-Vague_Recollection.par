; FOTD -- July 09, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the same area of a parent fractal that on 
; the surface appears exactly the same as the parent of 
; yesterday's image.  They both are everyday Mandelbrot sets.  But 
; the formula of today's image is (-Z)^(2.00001)+C rather than the 
; (-Z)^(2.0000001)+C of yesterday's.  This tiny change does little 
; more than expand the width of the infinitely-divided main stem.
; 
; Today's scene lies in the divided main spike of its parent, just 
; east of the large minibrot, though it lies a bit farther east 
; than yesterday's image.  The color palette has been directly 
; picked up from yesterday's image, with only a few registers 
; changed.
; 
; Having a fractional exponent of Z, today's image is filled with 
; discontinuities.  But the breaks are arranged around the central 
; minibrot in such an orderly and symmetrical pattern that they 
; are barely noticeable.
; 
; Despite the re-used colors, today's image rates an 8, at least 
; in my opinion.
; 
; The name "Vague Recollection" came to mind when something about 
; today's image reminded me of another image I had seen quite a 
; while ago, but could not recall.  Since naming today's image 
; however, I have remembered the earlier image, which is a scene 
; in a 20-year-old computer animation named "Theology".  This 
; animation is filled with extreme morphing representing mankind's 
; changing ideas of God and religion.  One of the more impressive 
; morphing sequences in that animation is when a dark gloomy 
; cathedral-like interior changes into a brilliantly colored 
; mosque-like interior.
; 
; The calculation time of a zippy 40 seconds will bring grief to 
; no one.  And the finished image really is worth the loss of a 
; precious 2/3 minute.  The web sites make the loss unnecessary.
; 
; Check the finished image and the other word-search puzzles at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition version of the image and an assortment of 
; related things is online at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The past images are available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Yesterday was a bit cooler than the day before here at Fractal 
; Central, and today was another bit cooler.  It was still warm 
; however, but the humidity was lower, making the temperature of 
; 84F 29C feel cooler than it actually was.  The scenic blue skies 
; dotted with puffy white clouds added psychological comfort.
; 
; The fractal cats, who have neither studied psychology nor 
; watched clouds, found their comfort in the artificially cooled 
; indoor air.  The humans, who do occasionally consider 
; psychological problems, found comfort when the work went well.  
; The next FOTD will be posted in the near future.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and how can we tell whether we have found 
; *THE* long-sought Higgs boson particle or merely an imitation 
; 'higgs-like' particle?  (And what's the difference?)
