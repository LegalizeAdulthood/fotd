; FOTD -- July 21, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD is late.  The reason -- FL and I took a day off on 
; Saturday.
; 
; The image is another view of the strange rectangle in the 
; Z^(2.003)+C Julia sets.  The rectangle itself, or what is left 
; of it, appears as the narrow blue-edged horizontal slit near the 
; center of the frame.
; 
; The image has been double rotated only +1 and -3 degrees from 
; the true Julia orientation.  When the Julibrot is sliced this 
; close to the Julia orientation, a small rotation makes a huge 
; difference.
; 
; A careful examination of the image will reveal that its apparent 
; top-bottom symmetry is 'almost', and not 'exact'.
; 
; The name "Rectangular Surroundings" simply describes the 
; location of the scene.  The rating of a 7 is in all ways 
; average, and implies average satisfaction on my part.
; 
; The four-dimensional geometry of the strange rectangle, of which 
; there are actually an infinity, is so complex that the rectangle 
; can appear as almost anything.  More of these unexpected and 
; surprising rectangular distortions will be posted as upcoming 
; FOTD's.
; 
; The calculation time is perhaps the best feature of the image.  
; Even when calculated with the rather complex SliceJulibrot4 
; formula, the image finishes in a fireball 35 seconds.  All 
; complexities may be avoided by viewing the image on one of the 
; web sites.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition rendering is waiting at:

; 
; For some reason the latest mass murder has me more revved up 
; than other similar disasters.  The loss of innocent lives is bad 
; enough, but, IMO, the worn-out knee-jerk responses coming from 
; the media outlets simply make things worse.  Only an idiot would 
; believe we could solve the gun-violence problem by passing more 
; gun control laws or by securing more guns to protect ourselves 
; with, but from what I am hearing on TV and talk radio, the world 
; must be filled with idiots.
; 
; I hear suggestions that we must keep guns out of the hands of 
; dangerous people.  This is another good-sounding idea that ain't 
; gonna work.  It is already illegal for convicted felons or 
; seriously mentally disturbed people to possess firearms, but 
; many mass-murderers have no criminal or psychotic background.  
; How would we decide who among the rest of the 'normal' popula-
; tion might be dangerous and must therefore be banned from posses-
; sing firearms?  While searching the general population for the 
; dangerous ones among us, we would need to avoid any perceived 
; profiling that might offend a disadvantaged minority'.  And we 
; would certainly not want any perceived invasion of privacy.
; 
; When Fractal Central was located back in Baltimore, I saw 'stop 
; the killing' rallies organized and held on a monthly basis for 
; at least 30 years.  Of course, the rallies merely 'preached to 
; the choir', and accomplished nothing.  It was almost a joke when 
; a drive-by shooting took place at one of the rallies.  Despite 
; the rallies, the killings have continued at a rate of up to ten 
; a week for over 30 years, and my sister reports from back at old 
; FC, that they are still continuing.
; 
; What is the point of all my talk about things people already 
; know?  I have no idea.  But I'll have much more to ruminate on 
; in upcoming discussions, and maybe as time goes on, a point will 
; emerge.
; 
; There is always an immediate point about weather however.  Heavy 
; clouds covered Fractal Central most all day today, but it stayed 
; dry and the temperature was a pleasant 75F 24C.  Late in the day 
; some breaks in the clouds appeared, bringing hope of a brighter 
; day to come tomorrow.  The fractal cats spent the day taking it 
; easy, which is always easy for cats to do when the humans are 
; away.
; 
; The day went pretty well for the humans also, who had a day of 
; antiquing down in Adamstown, which is near Lancaster.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted whenever it is ready.  Until that glorious 
; moment arrives, take care, and everyone knows what is wrong with 
; the world, but why does no one fix it?
