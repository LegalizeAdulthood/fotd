; 
; FOTD -- July 28, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows an order-21 minibrot lying serenely on a 
; filament extending from the northeast shore line of the large 
; bud on the north shore of the main bay of the oversized parent 
; Mandelbrot set, which is corrupted in its depths by Z^(21) 
; energies.
; 
; In the image we see that the expected quadratic pattern of 
; filaments prevails right up to the edge of the minibrot itself, 
; where all hell breaks loose.  Some interesting convolutions 
; exist in this cross-over area, but unfortunately, the image lies 
; at the limit of resolution of the DOS version of Fractint.
; 
; The name "Gloomy Depression" is a redundant statement inspired 
; by the dark gloomy color palette.
; 
; The rating of a 7 indicates that I consider the entire day's 
; fractal effort merely average.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/2 minutes is a rather long time to 
; wait to see the depressing image, but the web sites can cut the 
; wait drastically.
; 
; Enjoy the fractal non-glories for free on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Enjoy a high-definition version at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Enjoy all the back images, some quite cheerful, at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; But be aware that there are thousands of back images, and that 
; enjoying all of them will take quite a bit of time.
; 
; Typical midsummer weather, with a temperature of 86F 30C and 
; high humidity, made today a pleasant one here at Fractal Cen-
; tral.  The fractal cats were more worried about the arrangement 
; of their collapsible cubes than the outside conditions.  Due to 
; the possibility of rain, the humans postponed their regular 
; Saturday antiquing expedition.  The next FOTD will be posted 
; soon.  Check your dictionary for the precise definition of the 
; word 'soon'.  Until whenever, take care, and maybe we should sue 
; the churches for the damages done in natural disasters.  After 
; all, these disasters are known as acts of God, and the churches 
; are God's representatives on earth.
