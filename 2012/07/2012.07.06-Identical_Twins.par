; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- July 06, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the East Valley area of the large 
; minibrot on the main spike of the (-Z)^(2.0000001)+C Mandeloid.  
; On its surface, this parent fractal appears to be an everyday 
; Mandelbrot set.  But all is not well in its depths, especially 
; in the area of the main spike, which proves to be infinitely 
; divided once we zoom in well beyond the surface.  Today's scene 
; lies on a filament in a small area of chaos at the edge of the 
; divided stem.
; 
; The rating of 7.5 is an honest estimate of the image's worth.  
; The extra half point is a self-awarded bonus for the coloring.
; 
; The name "Identical Twins" points to the most surprising feature 
; of the image -- the two distinct minibrots at the center of the 
; four-armed, starfish-like surrounding pattern.  Unfortunately, 
; the magnitude of the image is as great as we can go, at least 
; with the Fractint program.  The identical twin minibrots are 
; beyond reasonable resolution.
; 
; The calculation time of one short minute will pass quickly.  The 
; image may also be seen on the FOTD web sites.
; 
; For a view of the image without the need of calculating it, 
; check the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; And enjoy the revealing high-definition rendering at:

; 
; The classic FOTD web site with thousands of back images is 
; online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Blazing sun and a temperature of 93F 34C made it obvious that we 
; are entering the hottest time of the year here at Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cats agreed by finding the coolest places 
; to stretch out in.  The humans turned up the cool air and went 
; about their work.  Then, thinking of the heat, I wondered why 
; 'liberals' and 'progressives' try so hard to convince everyone 
; that climate change is real.  Of course the climate is changing 
; -- it's how the earth works.  As long as I can remember, there 
; have been heat waves in summer, but the summer heat never seemed 
; as threatening as today's environmentalists are claiming.
; 
; I guess the concerned worriers simply need something fresh to 
; worry about.  One would suppose the 'end-of-world' shows on TV 
; would supply all the worry the worriers need.  Anyway, the next 
; FOTD will be posted before the earth heats to the boiling point 
; . . . I hope.  Until whenever, take care and before concerned 
; environmentalists begin their worrying, they should make sure 
; they are fully informed on the situation they are concerned 
; about, and what if anything can be done.  For example, a weather 
; pattern that brings prolonged hot weather to the East Coast of 
; the U.S. is not 'global'.
