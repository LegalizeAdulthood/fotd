; FOTD -- July 14, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image continues the theme of infinitely divided stems 
; and valleys.  At least, it was supposed to continue it.  When 
; today's image was finished, everything was there but the 
; expected infinitely divided stuff.
; 
; The scene lies in the valley cleaving the north bud of the 
; Z^(3.00001)+C Mandeloid, a fractal that should be 
; indistinguishable from the pure cubic Mandelbrot set.  But 
; today's parent was generated by the MandelbrotBC3 formula at 
; a level 9.43 turns up the hyper-ladder with the recip function 
; applied.  As a result, it is rotated 90 degrees, with the large 
; north bud centered on the negative X-axis, where all the 
; infinite division usually appears.  The big question is: where 
; has the infinite division gone.
; 
; Infinitely divided or not, today's image rates a spot in the 
; collection of FOTD images.  It is still filled with plenty 
; discontinuities, and the colors merely add to the excitement.
; 
; I named the image "Crazy Cubic" because of the missing 
; discontinuities.  I rated it at a 7, which is FOTD average.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes is fast enough to prevent 
; impatience, yet slow enough to allow a bit of anticipation to 
; build.
; 
; Seek and find happiness by viewing the finished image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Add to your happiness by viewing it in high-definition at:

; 
; Achieve perfect happiness by viewing thousands of images at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Clouds filled the sky here at Fractal Central today, with rain 
; showers in the forecast.  The temperature of 84F 29C was 
; pleasant enough, but the threatening conditions made outside 
; plans uncertain.  The fractal cats, Nicholas and Cassie, never 
; make outside plans, so they spent the day planning to get more 
; food than usual.  The humans made it through another day with 
; nothing much to report, which was not at all boring.  Due to a 
; bit of R&R FL has planned, the next FOTD will be delayed until 
; July 18.  Until sometime around then, take care, and no one is 
; perfect.  Perfect beings have no need to appear as humans.
