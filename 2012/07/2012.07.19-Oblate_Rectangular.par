; FOTD -- July 19, 2012 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is yet another and most likely the last scene in 
; the same parent Mandeloid that has been so prominent this month. 
; As the name "Oblate-Rectangular" shows, the orientation today is 
; halfway between the Oblate and the Rectangular.  To achieve this 
; orientation the entire Julibrot is rotated so that the line in 
; the Z-plane halfway between real(Z) and imag(Z) is perpendicular 
; to the Mandelbrot plane.  Then the direction of the slice is 
; rotated from the Mandelbrot orientation 90 degrees around the 
; imag(c) axis.  (If it's hard to picture, it's even harder to 
; describe in writing.)
; 
; The same maze of railroad tracks is still there, but the tracks 
; have now grown so tiny that only a toy train could run on them.  
; The central star-like object at first appears symmetrical, but a 
; closer look reveals that it is not.  In fact, look close, the 
; apparent symmetry of the entire image is an illusion.
; 
; I could not give today's image a rating.  The scene and colors 
; have been worn very thin by so much over-use.
; 
; The calculation time of 45 seconds is unusually fast for a 
; calculation of such complexity.  But the web sites are always 
; there to take away all calculation anxieties.
; 
; The finished image is posted online at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high definition rendering showing the details of those tiny 
; railroad tracks is at:

; 
; The FOTD back images are at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Ample clouds and a temperature of 84F 29C made today totally 
; unmemorable here at Fractal Central.  A light shower fell in the 
; morning, but it was of little consequence.  The fractal cats 
; have finally forgiven us for leaving them alone for three days 
; with plenty of food, water and litter, but no companionship, and 
; have spent a good part of the day in their cat cube complex.
; 
; We humans had another notably average day -- peaceful for us but 
; boring for those who seek gossip fodder.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in the future-time direction, distance yet to be 
; determined, but 24 light-hours is a good estimate.
; 
; Until whenever, take care, and poverty exists when people have 
; too little money to achieve the average living standard of the 
; society in which they live.  Therefore poverty can be eliminated 
; simply by giving the impoverished the money they need to raise 
; their living standard to the average.  Why then has this never 
; been done in the war against poverty?  (Perhaps the problem is 
; that simple minds seek simple solutions.)
