; FOTD -- July 22, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have been writing about the strange Z^(2.003)+C rectangle for 
; several days now.  Today I take us inside one of them.  The 
; image shows most of the inside of a tiny rectangle in one of the 
; railroad tracks in the upper left part of the image of July 20.  
; Today's scene is filled with square spirals and proto-rectangles 
; that continue the theme to ever deeper levels.
; 
; The name "Inside a Rectangle" describes the location of the 
; scene.  The rating of a 7 means I consider the image to be 
; average.  The color palette is the same as the earlier one 
; though with increased contrast.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/4 minutes is slightly slow.  Be 
; thankful for the web sites.
; 
; Find relief from that world-weariness by viewing the finished 
; image on the official FOTD web site at:

; 
; Moving on from the gun violence problem (which I have not yet 
; said the last word about) to the problem of climate change 
; leading to global warming, I must state my ideas about the 
; situation.  I am a firm believer in climate change and global 
; warming, and I believe that the warming temperatures will 
; eventually cause the ice sheets to melt and the oceans to rise.  
; But the warnings that we must immediately take drastic 
; impossibly expensive action to slow the climate change are 
; ridiculous.  It ain't gonna happen.
; 
; What could be done that might have even a minor effect and is 
; politically acceptable?  The answer is, nothing.  To begin, 
; man's activities are responsible for only a small part of the 
; warming, and countries like the U.S. and China, which are in 
; recession and need to expand their economies, will certainly 
; refuse to take the extremely costly steps to lower their CO2 
; emissions, which would also shrink their economies and add to 
; their financial difficulties.
; 
; Perhaps the most ridiculous solution is that we switch our 
; energy sources from fossil fuel to replaceable sources such as 
; solar and wind power.  Do the math.  Check how much energy we 
; use in the U.S. alone and check how many windmill generators 
; would be required to supply that power and how large an area 
; these generators would cover.  And then check how much it would 
; cost and how long it would take and how many parks and forests 
; would be replaced by bird-killing windmill farms.  You will be 
; surprised at the numbers.  If we turn to windmills, the same 
; environmentalists who are now clamoring for the windmills will 
; soon be clamoring even louder to save the parks, forests and 
; birds.  The story is the same with solar panels.
; 
; Global warming has started and will continue despite the uproar 
; from the left.  If we are determined to spend money on the 
; problem, we should suck it up and begin taking the first steps 
; to prepare for the inevitable changes.  If coastal cities will 
; be flooded, start building massive flood walls or moving the 
; cities to higher ground.  If low-lying island nations will be 
; submerged, start planning where to move the inhabitants.  If the 
; weather patterns will change, determine where the optimum areas 
; for agriculture will be located in the warmer climate.  A warmer 
; earth means faster ocean evaporation and heavier rainfall, not 
; the worldwide desert that is pictured on the 'doomsday' TV shows.
; 
; The only certain solution to the energy problem that I can see 
; is nuclear fusion.  (Not nuclear fission, which brings the 
; familiar dangers.)  If we must spend billions or trillions of 
; dollars, let's spend it on trying to get fusion working.
; 
; Today here at Fractal Central turned out to be an optimum 
; midsummer day, with partly cloudy skies, a temperature of 86F 
; 30C and breeze enough to cool those who over-exert themselves.  
; The fractal cats, never in danger of over-exertion or over-
; rumination, passed the day sleeping and playing, while the 
; humans wasted their limited energies pondering the worlds 
; problems.  The next FOTD will be posted in a certain time on a 
; certain mailing list and on certain web sites.  Until then, take 
; care, and if I'm going to be a blogger, I might as well do it 
; right.  I sure have enough to blog about.
