; FOTD -- July 03, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Big disappointment! . . . there was no FOTD for July 2.  The 
; reason is that I failed to find a fractal worth being made 
; public.  I think I might be growing too critical of my work, yet 
; at the same time I wonder what is better -- a catalog of 
; thousands of merely acceptable one-a-day images that will soon 
; be forgotten, or one or two really outstanding super-high-
; definition images that will make some notable change in the 
; public appreciation of fractal images.
; 
; Today's image definitely falls in the one-a-day category.  It is 
; a scene in the east valley of a Mandelbrot set corrupted in its 
; depths by Z^(31) energies.  The elephants that inhabit this area 
; are clearly evident in the overall quadratic pattern; the 
; strangeness lies in the minibrots, which are of the Z^(31) 
; variety rather than the expected quadratic kind.
; 
; The name "Elephant Action" refers to the contortions suffered by 
; the elephants that fill the image.  The image is also filled 
; with obvious holes.  Most of these holes are smaller minibrots, 
; but many are the centers of bottomless pits that are open 
; because of an insufficient maxiter.  I prefer to keep maxiters 
; on the low side because of both the better distribution of 
; colors when the 'logmap' is in effect, and the faster 
; calculation times.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is FOTD average.  Like so many images, it is 
; held down by too much familiarity.  I did put some extra effort 
; into smoothing the colors, but with such broad bands and only 
; 256 colors, the band edges are quite obvious.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/3 minutes will pass quickly.
; 
; Seeing the finished image on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; will be even quicker.
; 
; And for an unexpected thrill, check the hi-def rendering at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; All the back images are available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A rather hot but reasonably unhumid day passed with only a light 
; afternoon shower here at Fractal Central.  The temperature 
; reached 93F 24C, but with a humidity of only 29-percent, the 
; comfort rating remained within reason.  The fractal cats, who 
; are getting up in years, slept through most of the afternoon.  
; The fractal humans, who are also getting up in years, worked for 
; most of the day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a day or two.  Until whenever, 
; take care, and I hear they might have discovered the Higgs 
; particle, which some are calling the 'God Particle' because it 
; creates the universe by giving mass to the particles the 
; universe is made of.  The discovery has yet to be confirmed 
; however.
; 
; All this is well and good, but now the question could become, 
; 'what creates the god particle?'
