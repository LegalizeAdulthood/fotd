; FOTD -- July 04, 2012 (Rating 7*)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is extremely lucky, (if images can be considered 
; to have luck, that is.)  It was originally intended to be the 
; FOTD for this past June 20, but I accidentally lost it because 
; of a power glitch before I could bestow the honors upon it.  (I 
; run Fractint from a virtual ramdrive.)  But today, much to my 
; surprise, I found that I had saved its full parameter file under 
; the unlikely name 'todim.par' in my 'real' Fractint directory on 
; the 'real' C: disk, so the image, which is a very fast one, was 
; not lost after all.  The name "The Lost Image" is obviously self-
; explanatory.
; 
; The parent fractal is a Mandelbrot set with so much Z^3 
; corruption that the effects are just starting to show on the 
; surface.  Today's scene is located in the 'main spike' area of 
; the large minibrot on the 'main spike' of the parent M-set, 
; where the Z^3 corruption is especially strong.
; 
; The rating of 7* has a star attached, which indicates that the 
; image is not a new one, and also points out the resolution 
; breakdown just starting to appear along the band edges.  The 
; magnitude of over 10^13 is beyond the range of perfect 
; resolution and makes the mathtolerance entry necessary.
; 
; But despite the extreme magnitude, the image is a very fast one, 
; which calculates in a fireball 30 seconds.  And even this minor 
; calculation hassle may be avoided by checking the web sites.
; 
; Check the finished image on the official site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and the high-definition version plus interesting variations at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and don't forget the original, now classic web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Typical July 4th weather prevailed here at Fractal Central 
; today, with all the expected ingredients.  We had hot sun, the 
; usual high humidity, and a temperature of 91F 33C.  There were 
; even rumors of the typical rain storm that arrives at fireworks 
; time.  The fractal cats were skittish most of the day due to the 
; sporadic firecrackers going off in the neighborhood.  When 
; darkness arrived and the fireworks increased, they took to their 
; security places.  Meanwhile, the humans did little out of the 
; ordinary.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted within a reasonable time.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and what difference will the discovery of 
; the Higgs particle make in the life of the average person who is 
; not a physicist?
