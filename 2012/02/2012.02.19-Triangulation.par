; FOTD -- February 18, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In most of the fractal calendars I have seen, almost every image 
; is filled with spirals of various sizes and shapes.  I have 
; never quite understood this fascination with spirals, but there 
; must nevertheless be something attractive about them, so in 
; today's image I have featured a spiral.
; 
; Not wanting to merely go along with the crowd, I have cast aside 
; the countless circular spirals that fill almost every fractal 
; and found a spiral triangle.  I found the weird spiral lurking 
; on the west edge of the extra bay in the East Valley of the 
; parent fractal of the 'leaves' image that appeared two days ago. 
; I found no signs of minibrots in this area, but the triangular 
; stuff I did find, partly obscured as it is by clumps of detached 
; elephant trunks and spotted with smaller triangles, made an 
; image worth being declared FOTD.  The triangular spiral is a bit 
; subtle, so the image must be studied before the spiral effect 
; becomes obvious.
; 
; The rating of an 8 is based mostly on the mathematical interest. 
; As a work of fractal art, the image rates more like a 6-1/2.  
; The name "Triangulation" is self-explanatory.  The calculation 
; time of 5 minutes borders on unacceptable slowness.  To escape 
; the boring calculation, check the FOTD web sites.

; 
; The day began sunny here at Fractal Central, bringing hope of an 
; afternoon in the sun to the hearts of the fractal cats.  But 
; clouds moved in by midday, dashing their hopes.  The temperature 
; of 50F +10C was mild enough however to blunt the disappointment.
; 
; The humans, FL and I, added a bit of interest to the day by 
; taking an antiquing expedition down to Lemoyne, PA, a city 
; across the river from Harrisburg, where FL found a new lamp 
; table.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and every day someone finds another health hazard.  
; It seems that to end the constant worry about health, we will 
; need to totally eliminate all disease, aging, accidents and 
; finally death itself.  Then there will be nothing to worry about 
; but over-population.
