; FOTD -- February 17, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image opens a can of worms.  It reminds me of nothing as 
; much as a wriggling pile of worms like the ones we played with 
; when we were kids.  (Those were the days when it was all right 
; to play dodge ball or climb on a jungle gym, and we had to walk 
; all the way over to our friend's house and ring the bell when we 
; wanted to talk with him.)  The name "Wriggly Squigglies" came to 
; mind almost at once.
; 
; The parent fractal came about when I combined Z^(-0.5) with 
; Z^(-2.5) and added (1/C) on each iteration.  This parent is an 
; oversized thing shaped like a peanut lying north-south, with 
; most of the action in its north half.  Today's scene is located 
; in a squiggly filament on the western side of the far-more-
; active north half of the parent.  (The south half of the parent 
; has a valley jutting into it from the bland western shore line.  
; At first glance however, this valley appears to hold little of 
; interest.  But I'll check just the same.)
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 includes the standard half-point bonus for 
; my extra coloring effort.  The brief calculation time of only 50 
; seconds is a real bargain, but it is not sold in stores, and is 
; available for a limited time only.  ;-)
; 
; But wait!  Find the pre-calculated image on the official FOTD 
; web site at:

; 
; Typical harmless winter conditions prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central today.  The partly cloudy skies and temperature of 48F 
; +8C offended no one but the fractal cats, who were annoyed by 
; the sun, which kept coming and going.
; 
; The humans spent the day doing routine things such as 
; discussing politics and remembering the days before our culture 
; began disintegrating.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours. 
; Until then, take care, and is it really necessary to include a 
; warning in the cooking instructions of a frozen dinner to let 
; the consumer know that the product will be hot when it first 
; comes out of the oven?
