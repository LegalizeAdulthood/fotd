; FOTD -- February 24, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image I break out the 'biomorph' feature of Fractint, 
; an option I rarely use.  To me it seems too 'artificial', with 
; too much trickery and not enough math.  But this is only my 
; personal opinion.  Some fractalists might enjoy the patchwork of 
; colors it creates, a perfect example of which is seen in today's 
; image.
; 
; If the image had come about naturally, without using the 
; biomorph trickery, I might have rated it as high as an 
; exceptional 9.  As it is, I could give it a rating no higher 
; than a pretty good 8.
; 
; The parent fractal was created by subtracting Z^(-2.8) from 
; Z^(-1.1) and adding (1/C) on each iteration.  This parent is not 
; much of a fractal -- only two disembodied lobes of Mandelbrot 
; stuff with a network of twisting filaments on its east side.  
; Today's scene lies in the outer edge of this network.
; 
; I named the image "Mystical Wonderland", perhaps over-stating 
; its immediate effect a bit.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes is well within reason if 
; the task of setting up and running the parameter file is ignored.
; 
; The hassle of running the parameter file may be avoided by 
; viewing the finished image on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; All the past FOTD images may be seen at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today here at Fractal Central was spoiled by heavy clouds.  Only 
; a few sprinkles of rain fell, but the temperature of 43F +6C and 
; the dampness kept an unpleasant feeling in the air all day.
; 
; The humans had a rather pleasant day, during which nothing went 
; wrong.  The fractal cats always have a pleasant day, provided 
; they get everything they want, and get it quick.  The next FOTD 
; is scheduled to be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and search for the more subtle truths of existence.
