; FOTD -- February 03, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "The Meaning of Life".  I gave it this 
; name when I wondered whether there is a deep meaning behind 
; fractals such as today's, as well as behind fractals in general. 
; After all, meaning is not something that exists out there in 
; nature.  It is a concept invented by the human race, which 
; thinks in a cause and effect manner.  We try to give a cause to 
; everything that takes place because it disquiets us to know that 
; some things might simply just happen with no prior cause.
; 
; Today's image, which definitely did not just happen, lies in a 
; valley along the edge of the 'fan' of the parent fractal created 
; by combining 2.2 negative parts of Z^(-6.2) with 7 negative 
; parts of Z^(-1.2) on each iteration before adding (1/C).  This 
; parent consists of the typical north-south chain of large bays 
; and the prominent 'fan' found in many similar double negative 
; exponents of Z type fractals.
; 
; When I first saw the image, it appeared to have much potential, 
; but finding a good color palette proved unusually difficult, and 
; in the end, I could rate it no higher than a 7.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes borders on slowness.  But 
; as always, the FOTD web sites are there to bring instant relief 
; to impatience.
; 
; Enjoy freedom from calculation by viewing the finished image on 
; the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Enjoy freedom and also gain fractal satisfaction by viewing the 
; high-definition version at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Enjoy total nostalgia at the original FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where the entire FOTD history is posted.
; 
; A typical, rather pleasant midwinter day passed uneventfully 
; here at Fractal Central today, with partly cloudy skies, yet 
; enough sunshine to keep the fractal cats happy.  The temperature 
; of 43F +6C was well above normal, but in such a mild winter it 
; felt about right.
; 
; At lunch time, I avoided a debate about the flaws of liberal 
; politics, which I guess preserved the averageness of the day.  
; But tomorrow will not be an average day.  We will be taking a 
; one-day trip back to Old Fractal Central 150 miles, 240km south 
; of here, which means there will be no FOTD for February 4.  The 
; next FOTD will appear on schedule on February 5 however, that is 
; unless I get involved watching the Stupor Bowl on TV or the 
; Puppy Bowl on the Animal Channel.
; 
; Until next time, take care, and what are we?  Where do we come 
; from?  Why are we here? and where will we go from here?  If 
; these questions were either answered or shown to be meaningless, 
; it would take most of the fun and mystery out of life, and 
; perhaps out of fractals as well.
