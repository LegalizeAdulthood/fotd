; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- February 02, 2012 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a blast from the past, a slight tweaking of an 
; image that appeared several years ago.  The image was created by 
; the MandelbrotMix3 formula, which mixes four powers of Z on each 
; iteration instead of the two that the MandAutoCritInZ formula 
; mixes.  The big drawback of the MandelbrotMix3 formula is that a 
; critical value of initial Z must be found by hand, and even 
; using the graphic method, which can be done with Fractint, the 
; task is laborious.
; 
; The real(p5) parameter is the critical value of today's iterated 
; expression.
; 
; In today's image, 0.4 parts of Z^(1.8), two parts of Z^(-0.8), 
; one negative part of straight Z and two parts of Z^(0.8) are all 
; combined before (1/C) is added.  This strange mixture draws a 
; parent fractal that resembles a ragged figure 8 with a broad 
; stripe of chaos running horizontally through it and an obvious 
; Mandeloid in the center of the stripe.  To find today's image 
; however, I checked the jagged southern edge of the figure 8, 
; where the minibrots are plentiful.
; 
; Much of the blob-like effect was achieved by rendering the image 
; with the inside set to 'bof60'.  The rating of 8-1/2 is held 
; back because the image is a recycled one.  The name "Blobs in 
; the Night" came to mind when the image reminded me of one of my 
; favorite junky old sci-fi movies, 'The Blob'.
; 
; With so much stuff to calculate on each iteration, the image 
; takes 4-1/4 minutes to finish, which is a bit slow by FOTD 
; standards.  But once again the web sites ride to the rescue.
; 
; Be prepared for rescue by viewing the finished image on the 
; official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; And view it in high-definition at:

; 
; The entire history of the FOTD is available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Too many clouds filled the sky here at Fractal Central today, 
; which made the day less than perfect.  The temperature of 43F 
; +6C was mild enough, but the lack of sunshine kept the fractal 
; cats in sulky moods.  The humans, FL and I, had an uneventful 
; routine day.  I know it's dull to write about, but that's how 
; everyday life on earth goes.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and it appears that every weather event that happens turns 
; into a sign of global warming.  My opinion is that the world is 
; indeed slowly growing warmer, but we can do nothing about it, so 
; let's stop trying to pass more laws that will surely fail, and 
; use our resources to prepare for the warmer environment that is 
; sure to come.  It will not be nearly as catastrophic as the 
; doomsday prophets with political agendas would have us believe.  
; (The ever-increasing numbers of humans are the real problem.)
