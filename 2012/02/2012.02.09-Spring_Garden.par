; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- February 08, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I am currently involved with some nonsensical things I have 
; discovered in the fractals created by the new JulibrotMulti2 
; formula.  Until I can make more sense of the nonsense, I will 
; work with the workhorse MandAutoCritInZ formula, which, if 
; nothing else, does make at least a little sense.
; 
; The generating expression of today's image combines 3 negative 
; parts of Z^(-5.6) with 6 negative parts of Z^(-2.5) before 
; adding (1/C) on each iteration, which produces a parent fractal 
; beyond description.  Today's image is located in a ring near the 
; terminal of a filament on the northeast edge of the parent.
; 
; The image makes use of several 'tricks'.  To begin, it is 
; partially 'evaporated'.  And it has been rendered with the 
; outside parts set to 'tdis' and the inside parts set to 'bof61'. 
; The result is a scene that for some reason reminds me of a 
; garden in the springtime, and earns the name "Spring Garden".
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 includes a half=point bonus for the 
; coloring, which required some extra effort.
; 
; The calculation time of 35 seconds will pass in a flash, leaving 
; no time for impatience to raise its head.
; 
; Save the calculation effort entirely by surfing over to the 
; official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted for instant viewing.
; 
; The high-definition version is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A temperature of 32F 0C, thick clouds and light snow marred 
; today's weather here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats took 
; one look at the outside conditions and decided to spend the day 
; by the heat.  The humans had too much other stuff to do to let a 
; measly 1 inch (2cm) of snow disturb them.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and before we wonder when the forces of good will defeat 
; the forces of evil, we should decide exactly what is good and 
; what is evil.
