; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- February 13, 2012 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the parent fractal that results when 0.4 
; parts of Z^(-0.8) are subtracted from Z^2 and (1/C) is added on 
; each iteration.  This parent is a gargantuan spider network with 
; a very distorted Mandelbrot set near the origin.  Today's image 
; is located in a filament extending from a small bud on the 
; southwest shore line of the main bay of this distorted M-set.
; 
; The name "Captain Cutlass" came about when the sickle-shaped 
; elements reminded me of the cutlasses that might have been 
; wielded by the pirates of old.  (Many years ago I wrote a novel 
; of the same name, the plot of which is best left untold.)
; 
; A close examination will reveal a jaggedness along the edges, 
; especially near the minibrot at the center.  This jaggedness is 
; the beginning of total resolution breakdown.  With an image 
; magnitude of over 2*(10^13) this is to be expected.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 might be stretching it a bit.  The image 
; really holds little of an exceptional nature.  But like all 
; fractals, it is one that holds an infinity of secrets, which 
; makes it worth at least a cursory glance.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes is a bit long to wait for 
; an everyday image such as today's.  Here is where the web sites 
; ride to the rescue.
; 
; So be cool!  Avoid the hassle of running the parameter file by 
; viewing the finished image on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Be cooler!  View the image in high definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Be the coolest by viewing the entire library of FOTD images at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today brought total sun and a notably warmer temperature of 39F 
; +4C to Fractal Central.  The fractal cats made up for the sun 
; time they lost over the week-end by spending the better part of 
; the afternoon in the sun on the shelf in the southwest window.
; 
; At the same time, the humans made it through the day unevent-
; fully.  Somehow I became subscribed to a liberal political 
; activist e-mailing list.  I rather suspect that FL is involved 
; here, but it's no problem.  I rather enjoy reading the ideas 
; some liberals have about solving the country's problems, but I'm 
; not ready to go out and stand on a corner waving a sign about 
; the evils of the big corporations.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and what is wrong with humanity?
