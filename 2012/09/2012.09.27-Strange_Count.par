; FOTD -- September 27, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image gives a glimpse into the disorder that results 
; when a Mandelbrot set is seriously corrupted by negative Z^(6.5) 
; energies.  Today's parent M-set is barely recognizable as an 
; M-set.  It still has the tiny bud on the X-axis at the eastern 
; edge of the main bay however, and today's image lies deep on a 
; filament associated with this bud.
; 
; Perhaps the most striking thing in the image is the lack of 
; visible discontinuities, which certainly do exist but are 
; concealed by both the coloring and underlying fractal forms.
; 
; The name "Strange Count" does not refer to a certain well-known 
; vampire.  It refers to the 13 orangish shafts radiating from the 
; central minibrot.  The number 13 is not too surprising, since 13 
; equals (6.5)x(2).  Curiously, the northeast shaft, unlike the 
; other 12 shafts, is disconnected from the minibrot.
; 
; The central minibrot itself is surprising also.  Being of order 
; 6.5, this minibrot should have 5.5 lobes and main buds, but at 
; least at today's reasonable distance, it appears to have a full 
; 6 buds and only 5 lobes.  The distant appearance is deceiving 
; however.  A closer look shows that the northeast lobe, which is 
; larger than the other four, is actually 1-1/2 lobes, making a 
; total of 5.5, and the 2 buds attached to it are only 3/4 buds, 
; making a total of 5.5 buds.  So it all adds up, and all is once 
; again right in fractal land.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is dead average, held down a bit by the color-
; ing.  The image, as are all FOTD images, is worth a quick look 
; however, especially with a calculation time of only 40 seconds.  
; The image will seem more enjoyable when viewed on one of the web 
; sites without the need to calculate it.
; 
; All problems connected with calculating the parameter file may 
; be avoided by viewing the finished image on the official FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; And check the image in high definition on Hal's web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The thousands of back images are online at:

;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day began with light rain here at Fractal Central, but the 
; rain soon ended, and by midday the sun broke through, leading to 
; a partly cloudy afternoon with a temperature of 70F 21C.  The 
; fractal cats passed the day taking it easy.  FL spent the day at 
; a nearby fair, while I remained at FC, seeing that nothing impor-
; tant went undone.  The next FOTD will be posted in the proper 
; time.  Until whenever, take care, and if high technology were to 
; become our god, I guess I would be an Athiest.
