; FOTD -- September 16, 2012 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There was no FOTD on September 15 because FL and I took a short 
; trip to a nearby primeval forest and spent time by a waterfall 
; -- a very enjoyable thing that we actually did without a 'smart' 
; cell phone giving us constant access to the internet.  (I wonder 
; how people got along back in the ancient 20th Century without 
; one of those smart devices to keep them connected?)
; 
; The FOTD for September 14 was supposed to be the last of the 
; current rectangle series, but that evening, while I was going 
; through some early formulas, searching for the image in which I 
; originally discovered the Z^(2.003)+C rectangle, I turned up 
; today's image, which I feel fully deserves the honor of being 
; re-declared an FOTD.  The image has already appeared in a 
; slightly modified form, as an early FOTD, but it has lost none 
; of its impact since then.
; 
; Do not be scared off by the following description of today's 
; image.  It contains none of the offensive gore we see so much of 
; in violent movies and games.
; 
; At first glance the image looks like a man with his head missing 
; and a trapezoid, which is actually the distorted rectangle, 
; floating above his neck.  A close look will reveal two vague 
; wings like angels are supposed to have, extending from the 
; trapezoid and flapping in the air.  Since it is difficult to 
; remain physically alive with one's head missing, I assume the 
; wings are carrying the man's soul, (whatever a soul might be), 
; to wherever souls go when a person passes on.
; 
; The formula is an early effort to draw oblique slices through 
; the Julibrot.  It is not new, but it has been used so rarely 
; that it should be considered a new one.  With some effort, I 
; could have calculated the same image with a present-day working 
; formula, but laziness set in and I let it go as it is.
; 
; The name "On a Higher Plane" refers to one of those higher 
; spiritual planes of the new-age culture, which cause skeptics 
; knees to start knocking in apprehension.  Since the astronomers 
; have failed to find heaven even with their most powerful instru-
; ments, it must lie on one of these planes of higher vibration.
; 
; The rating of a 9.5 indicates that I consider the image to be 
; one of the all-time best.  It does indeed have a bit of artistic 
; worth, as those familiar with the strange paintings of the 
; surrealist artist Rene Magritte will recognize.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/4 minutes is a true bargain, so snap 
; it up before it is gone.
; 
; The finished image is available in totally absolute glory on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and in even more glory at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The FOTD back images are posted at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; and some of those images go pretty far back.
; 
; Things are beginning to take on a feeling of Autumn here at 
; Fractal Central.  The day dawned with a temperature of 50F 10C, 
; and by afternoon it warmed to a high of only 72F 22C.  The 
; brilliant sun did its best to warm the air further, but its 
; angle is getting so low that it is fast losing strength.  The 
; fractal cats enjoy the lower sun angle however.  They spent the 
; afternoon on their shelf in the southwest window, where the sun 
; now shines in more strongly every afternoon.
; 
; The humans spent the day doing human things such as watching the 
; news and discussing politics.  The next FOTD, again guaranteed 
; to hold no rectangles, will be posted when it is ready (most 
; likely in 24 hours).  Until whenever it does appear, take care, 
; and will mankind's growing fascination with computer-driven 
; technology be his salvation or downfall?  (Or are we all being 
; brainwashed into zombies by the space aliens from Sirius-C? )
