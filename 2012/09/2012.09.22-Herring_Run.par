; FOTD -- September 21, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the Z^(3.003)+C Mandeloid in search of 
; any geometric figures such as triangles or rectangles that might 
; lie there.  I had little hope of finding any such figures, since 
; rather than cutting through a stem, the negative X-axis of the 
; Z^(3.003) Mandeloid cuts through the West Valley, which is a 
; mirror of the East Valley.  But I did find a very interesting 
; area along the southern edge of the broadened valley, where the 
; elements are broken into herringbone like patterns.  Today's 
; scene shows a near-cubic minibrot lying in this herringbone area.
; 
; I named the image "Herring Run", which is the name of a stream 
; that runs about 1/2 mile from Old Fractal Central back in 
; Baltimore.  The image itself holds very little of a fishy 
; nature, though a few vague hints of elephants are visible.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is what I feel the close-to-average image is 
; worth.  The calculation time of 3-1/4 minutes is also about 
; average, making the image an average bargain.  An even bigger 
; bargain may be found however on the web sites.
; 
; The full glory of the finished image may be viewed online at:

; 
; The fuller glory of high-definition is available at:

; 
; The total glory of all the images may be viewed at:

;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A very pleasant end-of-summer day prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central today.  The fractal cats fully enjoyed the temperature 
; of 77F 25C, while the humans, who agree on many issues but not 
; everything, passed the day involved in work.  The next FOTD will 
; be posted in the foreseeable future, but probably not on the 
; 22nd.  Until whenever, take care, and I heard from the greenies 
; that we need a source of energy that is cleaner and less expen-
; sive than coal and oil, and exists in a quantity large enough to 
; make us independent of foreign sources.  We recently found such 
; a fuel -- natural gas.  I thought we were saved, but why are the 
; same greenies now protesting so much about its production.
; 
; Either the world is crazy or I'm crazy . . . . or maybe we both 
; are.
