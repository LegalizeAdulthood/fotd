; 
; FOTD -- September 26, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we ramble into the fractal world that appears when the 
; Mandelbrot set is corrupted by 4.5 negative units of Z^(4.5)+C 
; energies.  This parent fractal resembles the parents of the past 
; several days' images, and the image is located in the same tiny 
; east-central bud.  But, unlike the situation with straight 
; Z^(n)+C fractals, in today's situation the fractal interest 
; seems to increase as the exponent is raised.
; 
; I named the image "Double-Take" because it is filled with twin 
; pairs of Z^(4.5) minibrots.  The rating of an 8 shows that I 
; consider the image to be a rather good one, at least as far as 
; the underlying forms go.  I might have raised the worth to 8-1/2 
; or so if the brilliant green color palette had not been almost 
; totally created with a stroke of the <enter> key.
; 
; The calculation time of 30 seconds, like the times of all the 
; recent images, is a rounded approximation.  On some machines the 
; parameter file will run faster; on others it will run notably 
; slower.  Luckily, the finished image is available on the FOTD 
; web sites, where all uncertainty is eliminated.
; 
; The image is posted, already calculated, on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition rendering is online at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Thousands of FOTD back images and discussions are available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Clouds were the thing of the day here at Fractal Central today, 
; with only a few peeks of sun.  Rain showers simply added to the 
; confusion.  The temperature of 70F 21C was pleasant enough . . . 
; as long as the changeable weather was observed from indoors, 
; that is.
; 
; The fractal cats observed the conditions from their southwest 
; window, complaining every so often about the lack of sun.  The 
; humans had another in a long string of everyday week-days.  The 
; next FOTD *will* be posted.  That's all I can say right now 
; about exactly when.
; 
; Until whenever, take care, and I see that the dangers of cell-
; phone radiation are back in the news (on CNN at lunch time 
; today).  To read my comments about the dangers, check the FOTD 
; discussions of about 10 years ago.  BTW, it's now safe for the 
; phone companies to let the risk of too much cell-phone use be 
; widely known.  Almost everyone under the age of 30 is now 
; totally addicted to various wireless devices, which have become 
; just another necessary part of modern day life, and regardless 
; of the risk, they would never give them up.
