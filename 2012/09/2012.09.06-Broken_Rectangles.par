; FOTD -- September 06, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is another trip into the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid.  
; Or perhaps it would be more proper to say one of the Z^(2.003)+C 
; Mandeloids, for like so many other things in the world of 
; fractals, there are an infinity of Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloids.
; 
; In today's case the parent Mandeloid is the one that appears 
; when Z^(2.003)+C is iterated 0.00941066196782 levels down the 
; hyperladder with no function applied.  This parent fractal is 
; much like the 'normal' one, but the two branches of the main 
; spike are spread a bit wider, and the large minibrot is broken 
; into two totally separate and unusually distorted ones.  Today's 
; scene is located in an un-named valley of the northern minibrot.
; 
; The point at a mere 0.00941066196782 levels down the hyperladder 
; might appear unusually fussy, but it was carefully chosen.  This 
; is the point where the parent fractal has perfect X-axis 
; symmetry.  The symmetry probably has no special significance, 
; but being of an artistic nature, I prefer the symmetry.
; 
; Surprisingly, no open rectangles lie in this area, (at least, I 
; have not yet found any), but there are geometric open holes 
; aplenty.  Today's little minibrot lies in the middle of a field 
; of these holes.
; 
; The rating of an 8 indicates an above-average image that might 
; have been better if I had put a little more time into the 
; coloring.  The name "Broken Rectangles" refers to the twisted 
; quadrilaterals that might have once been rectangles.  The 
; calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes is about average, and should 
; cause little restlessness.
;

; The back FOTD's are available at:

; 
; A mix of sun and clouds, and a temperature of 82F 28C made today 
; quite pleasant here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats were 
; puzzled about being locked out of their favorite spare room, 
; where a new window was being installed.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in due time.  Until whenever, take care, and do we really 
; believe that something as complicated as the DNA molecule could 
; have evolved spontaneously and totally by accident in 13-billion 
; years? . . . Or do we really believe that some super being 
; intentionally designed it in some multiverse laboratory?
