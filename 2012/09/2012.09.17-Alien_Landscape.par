; FOTD -- September 17, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today, as I promised yesterday, we move beyond the field of 
; rectangles into the field of landscapes on other planets, where 
; we find the curious scene illustrated in today's image.  The 
; gravity on this alien planet must be extremely weak, since the 
; fractal rock formations appear barely able to support them-
; selves.  At the same time, the planet appears to have gravity 
; enough to hold a thin atmosphere, which gives the dark purplish 
; tinge to the background sky.
; 
; The generating formula, Mandnewt12, is the last in my ancient 
; series of MandNewt formulas, the purpose of which I have long 
; since forgotten.  These formulas seem to generate images that 
; combine Mandelbrot features with features found in fractals 
; generated by Newton's method of extracting roots.  At the 
; present time, the formulas serve to create fractals that are a 
; total surprise, which is why I sometimes turn to them when I 
; wish to be surprised.
; 
; Since many images created by these formulas consist only of 
; 'inside' stuff, they do not come to life until an active inside 
; fill is applied.  In today's image the 'atan' fill does the job.
; 
; The parameters were found by the evolver feature of Fractint and 
; then rounded off to make things simpler.  However I did set the 
; p3 parameters to unity by hand.
; 
; The calculation time of a mere 25 seconds will bring relief to 
; those who have more to do than can be squeezed into the time 
; available.  The web sites can eliminate even this brief delay.
; 
; The official FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The finished image is posted there to be viewed for free by all 
; interested fractalists.
; 
; A high-definition rendering is available, also for free, at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The back images are available online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; And all of them are free.
; 
; Today began foggy and chilly here at Fractal Central, with a 
; temperature of 48F +9C.  The fog cleared by mid-morning, leading 
; to a partly sunny afternoon with a high temperature of 73F 23C.  
; Rain was due to arrive after dark, but as of FOTD post time, had 
; not yet appeared.  The fractal cats had a day of roughhousing, 
; apparently forgetting that they had talked with the doctor when 
; they were kittens.
; 
; The humans made it through another day without anything happen-
; ing that was worth reporting.  The next FOTD will be posted when 
; the neat come home.  Jumbo was a bull elephant; Ferdinand was a 
; bull neat.  Don't call him a bull cow; it makes no sense and he 
; might be deeply offended!  Until whenever, take care, and keep 
; iterating.
