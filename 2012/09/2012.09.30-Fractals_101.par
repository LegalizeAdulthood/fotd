; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The day we spent yesterday back at Old Fractal Central went 
; quite well.  But the fractal cats disapproved of our all day 
; absence and our 10pm return.  A quick treat of tuna and cheddar 
; restored their good spirits.
; 
; Today's image shows both the Mandelbrot and Julia aspects of the 
; same Julibrot scene together at the same time.  Since I will 
; attempt to explain how this is possible, I have named the image 
; "Fractals-101".  The reddish outer parts outline the Julia 
; aspect of the scene, while the bluish inner parts show the 
; Mandelbrot bud aspect.
; 
; The bluish Mandelbrot bud near the center is about 60 times its 
; apparent size when it is viewed as a straight Mandelbrot shape.  
; To see the pure Mandelbrot view, reset the real(p2) and real(p3) 
; parameters to zero and reset the magnitude to 60.  (The value of 
; 60 is necessary because it is close to the value of the tangent 
; of 89.)  But how can a Mandelbrot image be enlarged by merely 
; slicing it at a very sharp angle?
; 
; The answer lies in the 4-dimensional shape of the high-iteration 
; Mandelbrot features of the Julibrot, which are extended to 
; infinity in two dimensions, and display the typical compact 
; Mandelbrot shapes in the other two dimensions.
; 
; Imagine an infinitely long cylinder in three dimensions with a 
; circular cross-section.  If it is sliced straight across, the 
; slice is a circle.  But if it is sliced at an ever increasing 
; angle, the slice is an increasingly stretched oval.  And slicing 
; the cylinder along its length produces an infinitely long 
; straight rod.  The angle of the slice causes the expansion of 
; one dimension of the slice.
; 
; In four dimensions we may have an object that is circular in its 
; two compact dimensions and extends to infinity in its two 
; extended dimensions.  Such an object may be sliced at two 
; independent sharp angles.  Doing this will give a 2-D slice that 
; is stretched in two directions, and if the angles are equal, the 
; cross section will be enlarged proportionally without being 
; stretched.  We have a Mandelbrot microscope.  The Mandelbrot 
; part of today's image was enlarged just this way.  (Unfortunate-
; ly, we can get no extra magnification of Mandelbrot objects by 
; doing this.)
; 
; The image itself is pretty routine.  The most interesting part 
; is the curiously shaped bluish Mandelbrot bud at the center.
; 
; The rating of a question mark means I don't really know how to 
; rate the image.
; 
; The calculation time of 2 minutes is reasonably fast, but the 
; web sites are always there to make things even easier.
; 
; Be happy!  View the finished on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; without the need to calculate it.
; 
; View the image in high-definition, with lots of added bells and 
; whistles such as anti-aliasing at:

; 
; A mix of sun and clouds, with a temperature of 64F 18C made 
; today quite typical of the end of September here at Fractal 
; Central in Central Pennsylvania.  The fractal cats enjoyed the 
; sunny periods on their shelf, and endured the cloudy times in 
; sulk mode.  The humans spent most of the day recovering from 
; yesterday's trip to Old Fractal Central, where my sister is 
; putting out food for the neighborhood cats that are starting to 
; gather in increasing numbers for a free meal.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in a reasonable amount of time.  Until whenever, 
; take care, and if we suddenly lost all our advanced technology, 
; how many, I wonder, would survive and how many would curl up 
; and expire.
