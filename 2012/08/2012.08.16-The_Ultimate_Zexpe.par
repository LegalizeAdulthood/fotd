; FOTD -- August 16, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The name of today's image, "The Ultimate Zexpe", is more a wish 
; than a fact.  It took two days to find a Zexpe fractal that 
; qualified for the status of ultimate, and even after finding it, 
; I'm not so sure how ultimate it is.  If ultimate is taken to 
; mean 'the best', its supremacy is quite doubtful, but if 
; ultimate is taken to mean 'final', then today's image certainly 
; is the last, at least in the present series.  Tomorrow's FOTD 
; will feature the first in a similar series of 'Zexpi' (exponent 
; PI) fractals.  (You ain't seen nothing yet.)
; 
; Today's parent double-Zexpe came about when I calculated 
; Z^(epsilon) at a level of epsilon steps up the hyperladder with 
; no function applied.  I omitted the function for the sake of 
; simplicity.  This parent has both main buds on the same side 
; (the northeast side) of the single main bay.  The scene lies 
; in a minor valley on the west side of the main bay.  (I often 
; choose to explore valleys because they emphasize the mathemati-
; cal characteristics of the particular area in which they lie.)
; 
; The first impression of today's image is its brilliance, which 
; earns it the rating of an 8.  The calculation time of 3 minutes 
; is slower than I would have preferred, but still well within 
; reason.  The web sites take the effort from viewing the image.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:

; 
; A high-definition rendering is posted at"

; 
; A near perfect summer day was fully appreciated here at Fractal 
; Central today.  The temperature of 81F 27C, low humidity and 
; Photoshop blue skies decorated with puffy white clouds were just 
; what the fractal cats ordered.  They spent a good bit of time 
; gazing out the window, wishing they could get outside to 
; explore that big forbidden room.
; 
; The humans had too many other things to do to appreciate the 
; weather.  (By the time humans have enough free time to enjoy good 
; weather, it's too late in life to enjoy very much of anything 
; [except fractals]).  The next FOTD will be posted in a proper 
; amount of time.  Until whenever, take care, and make that big 
; decision today.
