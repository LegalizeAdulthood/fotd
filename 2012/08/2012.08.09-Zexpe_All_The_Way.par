; FOTD -- August 09, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Zexpe All The Way".  The word 'zexpe' 
; stands for 'Z with an exponent of epsilon'.  Epsilon is the 
; number 2.718..., which happens to be the exponent of Z in 
; today's image.  The parent fractal is the Zexpe fractal, which 
; is created by the formula Z^(e)+C and has been studied by Lee 
; Skinner.
; 
; This parent fractal appears much as the cubic Mandelbrot set, 
; but with the two large north and south buds skewed to the west.  
; The fractal is most interesting along the negative X-axis, on 
; the west side of the main two-lobed bay, which just happens to 
; be where today's image lies.
; 
; Since the exponent of Z is a fractional number, the image must 
; contain discontinuities.  In today's image however, they are not 
; too annoying.  The most obvious extends from the minibrot to the 
; right edge of the frame.
; 
; The sequence of elements surrounding the central minibrot in the 
; image is 2.718...7.388...20.079,... though with the discontinui-
; ties breaking up the count, it is hard to find an easy-to-count 
; example of this series.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is average, since I consider the image to be 
; of about average quality.  The calculation time of 30 seconds is 
; unusually fast, taking most of the effort out of the calculation 
; task.
; 
; Save the hassle of setting up and running the included parameter 
; file by viewing the finished image on the official FOTD web site 
; at:

; 
; Typical midsummer weather prevailed today here at Fractal 
; Central, with hazy sunshine, increased humidity and a tempera-
; ture of 90F 32C.  These conditions pleased the fractal cats, who 
; were unusually lively until they ran out of steam in the after-
; noon.  The humans simply had another routine day.  (Actual facts 
; are sometimes boring.)  The next FOTD is scheduled to be posted 
; in 24 hours, and for all I know it might make it.
; 
; Until whenever, take care, and on a certain science show Wednes-
; day evening, the topic was "did we invent God?"  Since the show 
; promotes the scientific view, the answer was obviously going to 
; be "yes" -- men invented God in an attempt to bring meaning to 
; the apparently random events of their lives.
; 
; Actually, I was rather disappointed.  Most of the show featured 
; various psychological tests showing how man's brain is wired to 
; believe in the supernatural, though at the end it did throw a 
; bone of consolation to the believers.
; 
; I doubt that the show changed anyone's beliefs however.  Athe-
; ists already know that 'God' is only a comforting superstition, 
; while believers, who experience God in their lives every day, 
; already know that He does exist.
; 
; My thoughts were concerned with how strange it is that science, 
; which has almost reached the status of a religion, can with only 
; minor hesitation accept facts as counter-intuitive as those of 
; relativity and the quantum world, yet has such difficulty 
; accepting that a field of consciousness, which some would call 
; God, might pervade the universe.  Of course, if we accepted 
; this, we would then need to build a super-ultra-hyper supercol-
; lider to find the 'consciousness particle'.
