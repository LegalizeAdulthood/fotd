; FOTD -- August 05, 2012 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the parent fractal that results when 
; Z^(-1.1) is subtracted from Z^(1.1) and (1/C) is added on each 
; iteration.  This parent is a comet-like thing, a Mandeloid with 
; a tail sprouting from its East Valley and curving up and around 
; to the north and west.  The buds around the main bay are 
; arranged in an unusual manner, with the inconspicuous main 
; period-2 bud located on the southern shore line.  Today's image 
; lies in the filament network of the period-10 bud on the 
; northwest shore line, which is as large as the main bud.
; 
; I named the image "On the Sea Floor" when something about it 
; reminded of an underwater scene.  I could just as easily named 
; it something like 'all curves'.  I cannot find a single straight 
; line in it.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is boringly average, but even an average 
; fractal is worth a peek.  I might have raised the rating with 
; more work on the colors, but laziness won the day.  Luckily, the 
; image takes only 1-1/4 minutes to run on a not quite SOTA 
; machine.  On a true fireball unit it will finish in a matter of 
; seconds.
; 
; The finished image may also be seen on the official FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition rendering is posted at:

; 
; The FOTD back images are stored at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day dawned cloudy and muggy here at Fractal Central.  The 
; clouds broke late in the morning, leading to a partly cloudy, 
; muggy early afternoon, with a temperature that reached 90F 32C.  
; But a series of heavy thunder-storms moved in by mid-afternoon, 
; dropping the temperature to a much more pleasant 72F 22C.  The 
; fractal cats, always at their laziest in warm weather, passed 
; the day sleeping and watching the pigeons that appear to have a 
; roost nearby.
; 
; With the work caught up and nothing pressing to do, the humans 
; mostly took things easy during the day.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted before long.  Until then, take care, and what ever 
; happened to the face on Mars, which some say was constructed as 
; a sign by Tesla and Marconi when they reached the planet in anti-
; gravity flying saucers some time around 1940?  (Don't spoil the 
; fun by telling that the 'face' was merely a peculiar arrangement 
; of light and shadow, and Tesla and Marconi never did build a 
; flying saucer factory in a secret enclave that they founded in 
; the remote South American jungle and dedicated to advanced 
; science.)
