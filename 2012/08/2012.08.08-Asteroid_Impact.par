; 
; FOTD -- August 08, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have just realized that I have an old formula in the files 
; with the name MandelbrotBC4.  Please discard the formula I sent 
; earlier with today's FOTD and use this version with the formula 
; name changed to TrueMandelbrotBC.
; 
; NEW FORMULA ALERT! -- I think this is the first time I have used 
; the TrueMandelbrotBC formula for an FOTD image.  The formula 
; claims to be the most accurate way to create images using the 
; many values of the complex logarithm function.  Maybe it is; 
; maybe not.  Maybe there is no absolutely accurate way to find 
; the alternate values.  One thing for certain however is that, 
; whether the new formula is mathematically accurate or not, it 
; does draw interesting fractal images.
; 
; In today's image the new formula calculates the Z^(1.195)+C 
; Mandeloid 4.671 levels up the complex hyperladder to produce a 
; Mandeloid that resembles a kidney bean with an immense, 
; wandering filament extending from its northern edge.  The 
; minibrot in today's scene lies in a kink on this filament.
; 
; With all the doomsday shows on TV, I thought that, with today's 
; image, I might add my own little bit to the deluge of doom.  
; Perhaps the most popular way the world might end is for an 
; asteroid to strike the earth and send mankind the way of the 
; dinosaurs.  Today's image shows what might be a rogue asteroid 
; tearing through the earth's atmosphere on its way to strike the 
; surface and end life as we know it.  I named the fiery red image 
; "Asteroid Impact".
; 
; The rating of an 8 might be a bit much for the image, which 
; certainly is lurid enough if not an entirely new idea, but the 
; incredibly brief calculation time of 20 seconds easily makes up 
; for any short-coming.  And of course, the finished image is 
; always available on the web sites.
; 
; The explosive finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; And in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; All the FOTD back images are available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today turned a little warmer and more humid here at Fractal 
; Central, but remained within the range of midsummer comfort.  
; The brilliant sun and temperature of 88F 31C were just what the 
; fractal cats ordered; the humans were too distracted by work and 
; world events to enjoy the conditions.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted close to on schedule.  Until whenever, take care, and why 
; doesn't somebody pass a law making crime illegal?
