; FOTD -- August 14, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As the name of today's image, "Penultimate Zexpe", implies, it 
; is the next to last in the series of Zexpe images, and is also 
; supposedly the next to best in the series, with tomorrow's image 
; hopefully being the best.  The problem is that I have not yet 
; found an ultimate Zexpe, and am not sure that I will find one.
; 
; The parent Zexpe fractal came about when I brought up the 
; TrueMandelbrotBC formula and checked a mere 1/2 level down the 
; hyperladder.  This parent is shaped much like the minibrot at 
; the center of today's image.  It is rotated so that the single 
; large bud lies on the southwest side of the main bay.  A main 
; spike, much like that of the Mandelbrot set, emerges from this 
; large bud, and a large minibrot lies on this spike.  A field of 
; smaller mis-shapen minibrots is scattered mostly north of this 
; minibrot, with today's scene located in a valley of one of these 
; smaller minibrots.
; 
; The pattern surrounding the minibrot in today's image is unlike 
; anything found in the M-set.  It holds almost no recognizable 
; near-doubling series of elements.  The image holds many smaller 
; minibrots however that are withing reach.  Some of them might be 
; interesting, though I have not yet checked.
; 
; I feel that the rating of an 8 is justified, mostly because 
; today's image truly is something different.
; 
; The calculation time of 3 minutes borders on slowness.  
; Hopefully, the result will make the effort worthwhile.
; 
; The finished image may be viewed without the task of calculating 
; it by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition rendering is online at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The back FOTD's are available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Lots of clouds but some sun and a temperature of 84F 29C made 
; today a typical mid-august day here at Fractal Central.  The 
; fractal cats took it easy most of the day, with only a minor 
; interruption as Cassie had a hairball attack.  When the hairball 
; was eliminated, all went well for the rest of the day.
; 
; The humans had a typical day, which makes for relaxing living, 
; but hardly supplies material for an exciting novel.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in a typical length of time.  Until when-
; ever, take care, and all we need is for one single unexplained 
; UFO sighting to be a space craft of visiting aliens.
