; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- August 10, 2012 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is another scene in the same general area of the 
; Zexpe fractal as yesterday's image, though today we go a bit 
; farther northwest and check deep into a broad spiral, where we 
; find a minibrot surrounded by a much smaller and much more 
; tightly wound spiral.
; 
; I named the image "Zexpe Spiral".  The rating of the image is 
; another average 7, which was held down a half-point or so 
; because I re-used yesterday's color palette.
; 
; The Zexpe fractal holds much more variety than I have revealed 
; in the two most recent images.  I will show some of this variety 
; in the next few FOTD's.
; 
; The calculation time of 40 seconds is decidedly fast, and will 
; assure that no boredom has time to creep into their fractal 
; adventure.
; 
; Make life easier by viewing the image on the official FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and thereby avoiding the calculation hassle.
; 
; Make life more enjoyable by checking the high-definition version 
; at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Make life more fulfilling by studying the thousands of past FOTD 
; images at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Shortly after post time yesterday a heavy thunder-storm moved 
; in, complete with high winds and hailstones.  The fractal cats 
; became skittish when they heard the clatter, but held their 
; ground.  When the storm moved out, we congratulated them for 
; their bravery and rewarded them with a treat of their favorite 
; food.
; 
; Today began with clouds and rain, the rain ended early, but the 
; clouds remained into the afternoon, making the overall day 
; unpleasant.  The fractal cats spent most of the time in their 
; cat cube complex.  The humans spent the day pondering the 
; mysteries of existence, which despite our supposedly advanced 
; science, remain totally mysterious.
; 
; The next FOTD will soon be posted.  The only mystery is exactly 
; when.  Until whenever that might be, take care, and before we 
; can determine whether God exists, we must decide exactly what is 
; meant by the word 'God'.  After all, the impersonal creative 
; event of some is nothing at all like the personal creator of 
; fundamentalists.
