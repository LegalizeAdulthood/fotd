; FOTD -- August 06, 2012 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the parent fractal that results when 
; the formula Z^(1.618034)+C is iterated by the MandelbrotBC3 
; formula at ground level with no function applied.  To see this 
; parent fractal, shut off the logmap and back out to a magnitude 
; of 20.  You will also see that the image is located rather deep 
; in the East Valley section of this parent.
; 
; But wait!  The image is named "Pseudo Parent".  The reason is 
; that this parent fractal is not the true parent at all.  It is a 
; large satellite on the south side of the full true parent, which 
; can be viewed by backing farther out to a magnitude of 0.4.
; 
; I could give the image a rating no higher than a 6.  I have 
; posted entirely too many similar images to rate it any higher.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes will make short work of 
; any impatience.  Visiting the web sites will totally eliminate 
; it.
; 
; Save calculation effort by viewing the finished image on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Increase your pleasure by viewing it in hi-def at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And be sure to check the back images at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The humidity departed today, leaving Fractal Central with a 
; fine, partly cloudy day with a temperature of 84F 29C.  The 
; fractal cats had a peaceful day except for a brief squabble over 
; ownership of the laundry basket, which ended with Nicholas 
; getting hit in the nose and Cassie happily in control of the 
; basket.
; 
; The humans had a typical partly-enjoyable FC day, with the work 
; light.  During the lunch break, FL told me that I might have an 
; 'asparagus' personality.  This is good, since asparagus is my 
; favorite vegetable.  The next FOTD will be posted before it has 
; time to be missed.  Until whenever, take care, and would the 
; next mass murderer please give prior warning.
