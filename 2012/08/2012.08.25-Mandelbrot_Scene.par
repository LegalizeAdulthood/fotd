; FOTD -- August 25, 2012 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After seeing the Mandelbrot set on TV last evening, I thought I 
; would return to it as the source of today's image.  The image I 
; found shows a minibrot deep in Seahorse Valley, at the limit of 
; resolution.
; 
; Thanks to the serendipitous coloring, the image rates an 8.
; 
; The name "Mandelbrot Scene" is a simple description.
; 
; The calculation time of a few seconds is true when the image is 
; calculated using the standard double-precision math routine.  A 
; slightly improved rendering will result if arbitrary-precision 
; math is used, but doing so will cause the calculation time to 
; leap to well over a half-hour.
; 
; The finished image is online at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A rendering in high-definition is online at:

; 
; The back images and discussions are online at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Friday evening I caught a watered-down pop-science show on one 
; of the discovery channels.  The advertised topic was chaos.  
; When the show began, I expected the discussion would soon get to 
; fractals, but fractals were not mentioned until 45 minutes into 
; the show, and then, after a meager 5 minutes devoted to Mister 
; Mandelbrot and his well-known Set, the show started pushing its 
; apparent agenda -- an attempted demonstration of how life might 
; have come about through random evolution rather than from 
; intelligent design.
; 
; At the disappointing end, I was left feeling that the show had 
; been produced more as an attack on the fundamental Christian 
; theory of intelligent Creation rather than as a demonstration of 
; the wonders of chaos and fractals.  Too bad.  It was a great 
; opportunity gone bad.  (I wonder if some skeptic or Atheist 
; organization was behind it.)
; 
; Lots of clouds and a temperature of 84F 29C made the day a 
; nondescript one here at Fractal Central today.  The fractal cats 
; had nothing to complain about, nor did they have anything to 
; enjoy.  The humans had an average day.  FL went to a party or 
; something in the afternoon; I thankfully escaped.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in the near future.  Until whenever, take care, 
; and watch out for both zealous skeptics and true believers.
