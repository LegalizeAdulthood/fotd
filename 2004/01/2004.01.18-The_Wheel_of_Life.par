; FOTD -- January 18, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid.  This is 
; the same fractal that holds the curious Julia rectangle that I 
; sometimes use as an interesting FOTD object.  But that rectangle 
; exists at the ground level of the formula, which can be seen by 
; setting the real(p1) parameter of today's MandelbrotBC1 formula 
; to 2.003, and the real(p2) parameter to 3.14159...
; 
; The actual parent fractal of today's image lies 1040 levels up 
; the logarithmic hyper-spiral.  Such an extreme height is 
; necessary because the exponent of Z is so close to an integer 
; value.  This closeness causes the parent fractal to rotate and 
; change very slowly as the value of real(p2) is raised.
; 
; At a height of 1040, the parent fractal is rotated 180 degrees, 
; a position that has the main stem, which has split into infi-
; nite flinders, facing east, and the East Valley, which has 
; become smeared out, facing west.  Interesting things happen at 
; both locations.
; 
; Today, we examine the things that happen on the east-facing main 
; stem.  I have chosen to explore the area immediately behind the 
; large midget.  In this area, we find what looks like a grid of 
; railroad tracks, with midgets located where the switches would 
; lie.  Today's scene is located in the basin of attraction of a 
; larger midget, which in turn is located in the basin of the 
; largest midget on the main stem.  And BTW, this large midget has 
; been transformed into something that must be seen to be believed.
; 
; To liven the image I have rendered it with the outside set to 
; 'fmod' and the proximity set to the default 0.01.  When editing 
; the parameter file, I entered the proximity value by hand, 
; though I doubt that this was necessary.
; 
; While searching for a name, I was thinking of the mysteries of 
; existence, which probably inspired the name "The Wheel of Life". 
; The name is justified by the filimentary circular features 
; surrounding the central midget.  The rating of 7 combined with 
; the render time of just under 4 minutes gives an overall value 
; of 183.  A good way to increase this value is to download the 
; completed GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Saturday was cloudy and chilly here at Fractal Central, with a 
; high temperature of only freezing.  The snow held off until 
; nightfall, giving the duo of cats ample time to wander the yard 
; in search of adventure.  They found none, and peacefully retired 
; to their beds at the end of the day.  Today is starting most un-
; pleasant, with an inch of slush on the ground and a cold rain 
; falling.  It's a good thing I have tuna in stock.
; 
; My precognition now tells me that in 24 hours I will return with 
; the next FOTD.  So until then, take care, and either see the 
; light or remain in the dark.  The challenge is how to recognize 
; the actual light.
