; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I stepped back to view today's image from a distance, I was 
; immediately reminded of an undersea scene, where a squid or 
; octopus has been threatened and has released a cloud of black 
; ink to conceal its escape.  Since I saw no actual squid in the 
; image, I named it "The Unseen Squid".  (I doubt that a Mandel-
; brot 'molecule' could pass for a squid.)
; 
; All in all, it's a very traditional fractal, created with the 
; MandelbrotMix2 formula and rendered with the outside set to 
; 'iter' and the inside set to zero.  The image has the appearance 
; of being very close to the escape radius, but this appearance is 
; the actual nature of the fractal at this particular point.  
; Increasing the bailout by entering a large number as the 
; imag(p3) parameter has very little effect on the image.  A large 
; bailout radius will not evaporate the image because its formula 
; contains a positive power of Z.
; 
; When rating the image, I studied it for several minutes, trying 
; to find a reason to rate it at a 6.  I found nothing in it worth 
; more than a rating of a very-average 5.  Combined with a render 
; time of 11-1/2 minutes, this gives an overall value of 43.
; 
; This value can be raised considerably by letting Paul render the 
; image and downloading the finished product from his web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The temperature reached 48F 9C here at Fractal Central Tuesday 
; afternoon, though the clouds, which came and went, kept 
; conditions from being ideal.  The fractal cats had as good a day 
; as possible in the yard, considering the less-than-ideal 
; weather.  This morning is much colder, and a snowfall is moving 
; in.  The cats' moods will suffer, I fear.
; 
; My day will be adequate once I finish the waiting work.  And an 
; adequate day is about the most one can ask for.  Tomorrow, I 
; will return with another fractal of a quality yet to be deter-
; mined.  Until then, take care, and have faith in fractals.
