; FOTD -- January 07, 2004 (Rating 2)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates a horrendous 2.  It is one of the lowest 
; rated images ever to have made the status of FOTD.  And to make 
; things worse, it takes almost an hour to render.  Normally, this 
; image would have been an instant victim of the delete key, but I 
; included it among the honored FOTD fractals for two reasons: 
; first, I wanted to demonstrate what, IMO, makes a fractal image 
; bad; second, I had a bad day at the fractal keyboard.  (Those 
; who work with fractals have bad days, just like those who work 
; with everything else.)
; 
; The image is an 'evaporated' one in the parent fractal that 
; results when some Z^(-1.2) is subtracted from some Z^(-2.1) and 
; (1/C) is added.  This parent fractal has within it far more 
; potential than would be guessed by glancing at today's image.  
; To prove the point, tomorrow's image will be another scene in 
; this same parent fractal, and I guarantee the image will have 
; a higher rating.
; 
; I will not dwell at length on the deficiencies of today's image. 
; The image speaks, (or does not speak), for itself.  The ring-
; like features hold some promise, but the muddy, unorganized 
; colors spoil anything that the rings might hint at.  I guess the 
; best thing to do with today's image is to consider it a reminder 
; that the many FOTD images which rate a 6 are indeed a little 
; above average.
; 
; I gave little thought to naming the image, finally deciding on 
; the discouraging name "Total Failure".  Few will want to devote 
; nearly an hour of computer time to rendering the failed fractal, 
; but Paul is one of the few, and the completed GIF image will be 
; available for download on his web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; as soon as he can get it posted.
; 
; The temperature on Tuesday here at Fractal Central reached no 
; higher than 36F 2C, and to make things worse, a snow squall 
; struck at 2:30 pm, just as the cats were starting to enjoy their 
; time in the yard.  The sudden snow and burst of wind sent them 
; scurrying to be let inside.  The snow moved out within 20 
; minutes, leaving a dusting on the grass, and the sun returned, 
; but by then the duo were safely settled by their radiator, where 
; they spent the rest of the afternoon sleeping.  This morning is 
; starting sunny but windy and very cold, with a temperature of 
; 18F -8C.  These are not the conditions to make sensitive cats 
; happy, so I guess we'll have to wait and see how the day goes 
; for them.
; 
; For me it looks like a fairly routine day.  Until next time and 
; a better fractal, take care, and if the truth were known . . .
