; FOTD -- January 21, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's FOTD I tried the trick of the past two days on 
; the quartic Mandeloid.  This trick worked quite well on the 
; quadratic and cubic Mandeloids, leading to some very inter-
; esting images, but it produced only near-total chaos when I 
; applied it to the quartic Mandeloid.
; 
; A quick glance at today's image shows a scene that has no 
; business being in a fractal with a formula of Z^(4.003)+C.  The 
; image is totally disorganized.  Where is the 4,16,64... symmetry 
; that should be there?  What are all the discontinuities doing in 
; the picture?  Forget about unimportant things like the meaning 
; of existence; these fractal mysteries are the questions that 
; need to be answered.
; 
; When I saw the image, I thought, "What the...", and the name 
; stuck.  Unfortunately, we will have no third consecutive 8-rated 
; FOTD.  Today's image rates only a 5, which gives an overall 
; value of 53 when combined with the render time of 9-1/2 minutes.
; 
; The value may be increased by downloading the finished GIF image 
; from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Another very cold day Tuesday here at Fractal Central kept the 
; cats safely ensconced indoors.  The high temperature reached 
; only 28F -2C, which was far too cold for their sensitive ears.  
; But they had a pleasant day anyway, resting by the heat.  Today 
; is another repeat.  Somehow the cats will survive.
; 
; The work for me is rather heavy today, so I had best get back 
; on it.  Until next time and next FOTD, take care, and don't get 
; spammed -- it's no treet.
