; FOTD -- January 05, 2003 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image I make one of my rare departures from fractal 
; purity.  Instead of showing an interesting scene rendered in the 
; normal manner, the image shows a rather ordinary scene rendered 
; in an unusual manner.  Instead of consisting of equal iteration 
; bands, the image was created by rendering it with the outside 
; set to 'atan'.
; 
; Instead of spending my fractal time searching for a scene, I 
; spent it in fine tuning the color palette for the smoothest 
; possible effect.  The net result rates a 4, which is somewhat 
; below average, and shows that, at least to me, an undistorted 
; presentation of a fractal discovery is more important than 
; pseudo-artistic fractal 'creativity'.
; 
; I named the image "Octo-Something".  An early version of the 
; image had eight 'somethings' lying somewhere in it.  But 
; whatever it was that inspired the name has long since been lost.
; 
; In the image, the perennial midget is offset to the right, and 
; has little of the usual symmetry surrounding it.  The lack of 
; symmetry is partly due to the nature of the area and partly due 
; to the unusually low magnitude.  This low magnitude has one 
; great benefit however -- it makes the image a very fast one.  
; The 45-second render time is a welcome relief from the 1-1/2 
; hour wait that was necessary to see yesterday's image.
; 
; The parent fractal, which was created by combining negative 
; portions of Z^(-1.9) and Z^(-9.1) and adding (1/C), is a 
; shapeless thing with three large bays and many smaller coves.  
; Today's image is located in an unlikely area that I happened to 
; zoom into by chance.
; 
; It will probably take longer to download the image than to 
; render it from the included parameter file, but those who 
; choose to download will not be disappointed.  The completed 
; image is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Though Sunday promised to be pleasant here at Fractal Central, 
; the promise was not fulfilled.  Instead of the forecasted sun 
; and temperature close to 70F 21C, we had heavy clouds and a 
; temperature of 46F 8C.  The cats tried the yard only a few 
; minutes before deciding that a day indoors would be more com-
; fortable.  The traditional tuna treat restored their spirits.
; 
; Today is starting even worse -- it is raining.  Check back in 24 
; hours to see how the cats adapt, and when you do, you might even 
; enjoy a better fractal.  Until then, take care, and keep discour-
; agement at bay.
