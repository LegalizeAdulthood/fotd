; FOTD -- January 11, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In the East Valley area of the Mandelbrot set there lives a herd 
; of elephants.  Each elephant stands astride its personal bud, 
; guarding that bud from anything that might threaten it.  In the 
; cubic M-set two elephants guard each double bud.  In the quartic 
; set, there are three elephants per triple bud.  And so it contin-
; ues into infinity, the elephants eventually merging into a haze 
; of undifferentiated elephant stuff.
; 
; But what of the Z^(1.5)+C Mandeloid?
; 
; In this set, the same trend continues.  Half an elephant stands 
; guarding each half-bud.  I have no idea what happens to the ele-
; phants' rear ends, but the front parts are there, complete with 
; curled trunks.
; 
; It took the MandelbrotBC1 formula to show a level of the parent 
; fractal where these half-elephants are not broken beyond recogni-
; tion.  Luckily, that level was found only 1.5 turns up the log-
; arithmic hyper-spiral.
; 
; I named the image "Half an Elephant", most likely because half 
; an elephant is better than none.  Of course, a half-elephant is 
; not as good as a whole elephant, but that's another story.
; 
; When the time to do the rating arrived, I pondered the image and 
; decided on a rating of 6, which combined with the render time of 
; 10.67 minutes gives an overall value of 56.
; 
; The GIF image is available for near-instant download on Paul's 
; web site at:

;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather Saturday here at Fractal Central was very cold.  All 
; day, my digital thermometer hung around 10F -12C, which kept the 
; cat duo confined very securely to the sources of heat.  They 
; needed only one minute on the porch to convince them that the 
; outdoors was uninhabitable.  In the evening, I presented them 
; with a treat of tuna, which lifted their sullen spirits.
; 
; Today, the regular work is pretty much caught up, but the 
; fractal lady is thinking of a trip to look at 'antiques', (IMO, 
; discarded junk), so I guess I'll tag along.  But I'll be back in 
; plenty time to find the next FOTD fractal.  Until that next 
; fractal appears, take care, and look for the other half.
