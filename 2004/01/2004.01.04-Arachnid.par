; FOTD -- January 04, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Last evening I heard an item on one of the local news outlets 
; that caused me to stop and wonder.  The news item claimed that, 
; with 500 or so homicides in 2003, Chicago had the highest murder 
; rate in the nation, while here in Baltimore, we had only 300 or 
; so homicides, making us only 60-percent as violent.  It sounds 
; good until one realizes that the population of Chicago is around 
; 3,000,000, while the population of Baltimore is close to 
; 600,000.  My calculations tell me that this gives Baltimore a 
; homicide rate 6 times that of Chicago.  I wonder whether this 
; was local Chamber of Commerce propaganda or whether the news 
; reporters actually did not know any better.
; 
; When this kind of stuff starts annoying me, I turn to fractals 
; for distraction, and in this case, I was distracted by today's 
; image, which like yesterday's, is an evaporated one consisting 
; only of 'bof61' inside fill.
; 
; The image is a scene in the ghost of the fractal that results 
; when various portions of Z^(-1.8) and Z^(-8.1) are mixed and 
; (1/C) is added, then the whole thing is evaporated by raising 
; the escape radius to one-googol.
; 
; I named the image "Arachnid".  I gave it this name when the dark 
; filaments surrounding the ever-present central midget reminded 
; me of a spider's web in front of a carnival-like display of 
; colors.
; 
; I rated the image at a 6, since IMO it's not really that great.  
; Another drawback is the render time, which on my machine is over 
; 1-1/2 hours, making a download of the completed GIF image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; the far better choice.  But before rushing for the download, 
; give Paul an hour or so to render and post the image.
; 
; Saturday was warm or chilly, depending on which side of town one 
; was located.  Here on the northeast side, the temperature 
; reached 52F 11C, which was mild enough to keep the cats happy; 
; but a few miles to the south, the temperature reached 70F 21C, 
; which would have made them ecstatic.  As it was, the duo spent 
; several hours in the yard, meditating and enjoying their senior 
; years.
; 
; My day went fair enough.  Hopefully, today will be just as fair. 
; Until next FOTD, take care, and stay fairly well.
