; FOTD -- January 12, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Every once in a while one must vent a little frustration.
; 
; In my e-mailbox this morning I found at least a dozen letters 
; telling me how to get a bigger pole, or a heavier or longer or 
; bulkier pole, etc.  Why would anyone want to sell me a new pole? 
; I don't need a bigger pole.  The pole standing in the corner of 
; the fractal yard has been faithfully supporting the wires for at 
; least 40 years.  It is 10 meters tall, 30 cm thick, and still in 
; perfect condition.  The market for poles must be very limited.  
; Those spammers should wise up and try to sell a product that 
; people actually want.
; 
; The fractal for today is far less confusing.  It is a scene in 
; the fractal that results when 8.3 parts of Z^(-3.8) are subtrac-
; ted from 9.8 parts of Z^(-1.5) and (1/C) is added.  To compli-
; cate things, the fractal has been evaporated and rendered with 
; the 'bof61' inside fill.  Fractal evaporation is achieved by 
; raising the escape radius of fractals with negative exponents of 
; Z to a value large enough so that all points are trapped.
; 
; I named the image "Into the Crucible".  With its clashing colors 
; that are almost painful to look at, it reminds me of looking 
; down into a crucible of molten steel.  The rating of a 7 seems 
; appropriate -- at least by my fractal standards.  Those with 
; different standards may rate the image differently.  Combined 
; with the reasonable render time of 3-1/2 minutes, the image has 
; an overall value of 200.
; 
; Those who prefer their fractals ready-to-go may pick up the 
; finished GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; It was warmer here at Fractal Central on Sunday, and the sun was 
; shining most of the day, but the temperature of 28F -2C was 
; warmer only by comparison to the day before, and the fractal 
; cats compared the temperature to a day in midsummer.  They 
; decided to remain indoors all afternoon, thinking of what might 
; have been.  Today is starting even warmer -- it's actually above 
; freezing.  But it is cloudy.  We shall see what the duo makes of 
; this.
; 
; And I must decide what to make of the work on the shelf beside 
; me.  Most likely, I'll work on it until it is finished.  And 
; when it is finished, I will enter fractal-land to see what has 
; happened since last I ventured there.  Whatever I find will 
; appear as the FOTD for tomorrow.  Until then, take care, and 
; remember the children.
