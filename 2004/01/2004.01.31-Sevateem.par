; FOTD -- January 31, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have no idea what the name of today's image has to do with its 
; actual appearance.  The name is one I invented on a whim, pure 
; nonsense, a word such as one might find in the 'Alice in 
; Wonderland' books.  But such nonsense is not surprising in this 
; modern-day world of science, where we have books of popularized 
; quantum physics speaking nonsense such as Carroll never dreamed 
; of when he wrote his 'Wonderland' books, and then declaring the 
; nonsense to be a model of some strange kind of 'reality'.  At 
; least I make no claims that today's fractal is real -- not real 
; in the every-day objective sense, that is.
; 
; The image is a scene in the fractal that results when 1/3 part 
; of Z^4.5 is added to Z^2.5 and 1/C is then added.  This parent 
; fractal appears as a fragment of a Mandeloid that fills the 
; screen, with a sharply-defined but very distorted Mandeloid just 
; off the bottom of the screen.  In today's image, I ignored this 
; distorted Mandeloid and concentrated on the large fragment.  
; Today's scene is located at the edge of one of the arms marking 
; the entrance to a partly-obscured bay on the southern edge of 
; the fragment.
; 
; As is frequently the case in fractals where two or more powers 
; of Z are combined, certain parts of the image appear eroded, and 
; filled with holes of all shapes.  Today's image lies in such an 
; area, and the greater part of it consists of such 'inside' 
; holes.  I have made this 'inside' area do things by rendering it 
; with the 'fmod' option, with the proximity set to 0.25.
; 
; The result is a FOTD that rates a 7 -- not as good as I might 
; have hoped for, but certainly better than some of the images 
; that have made it to FOTD status.  Is the image worth the 
; 11-minute render time that, combined with the rating of 7, 
; results in an overall value of 63?  This is a question which 
; each individual must answer for himself.  But the question may 
; be eliminated by downloading the finished GIF image from Paul's 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and avoiding the rendering stage entirely.
; 
; Friday was a very busy day for me here at Fractal Central.  For 
; the fractal cats it was a boring day.  The temperature of 23F 
; -5C and brisk winds kept them confined to their beds by the 
; heat.  In the evening, they demanded a treat of tuna, which I 
; gave them willingly.  After all, I had ignored them all day.  
; This morning is even colder.  It looks like another day curled 
; by the heat for the dynamic duo.
; 
; For me it looks like a far slower day.  If I'm clever enough, I 
; might get through the whole day without doing a bit of useful 
; work.  And I'll return on schedule in 24 hours or so with 
; another fractal.  Until next time, take care, and be forever 
; fractalish.
