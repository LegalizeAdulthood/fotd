; FOTD -- January 27, 2004 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After yesterday's exciting adventure in the world of Z^1.003, I 
; decided to subtract Z^(1.003) from Z^(-1.003) and explore the 
; fractal world created by this combination.  Before starting, I 
; had to decide on the escape radius, which has a significant 
; effect on fractals in this range.  I chose the escape radius of 
; 250 entirely at random.  Apparently, I chose well.  The image I 
; found rates an 8 and has an overall value of 43.
; 
; The resulting parent fractal is an almost-symmetrical Mandeloid 
; rotated 90 degrees.  Perhaps I should describe the parent as 
; part of a Mandeloid, for the northern area of the Mandeloid is 
; obliterated by the blue disk that usually appears at the origin 
; of fractals with negative exponents of Z, and is likely an 
; artifact.  It's no problem however, because today's scene is 
; located in the East Valley area, which lies on the south side of 
; the Mandeloid.
; 
; Much of the flowery effect resulted from rendering the scene 
; with the outside set to 'summ' rather than the usual 'iter'.  
; The name "Bouquet of Numbers" came to me as I sat in wonder that 
; all this came from such a simple beginning.  The render time of 
; 18 minutes is bearable, but a far better way of viewing the 
; image is to download it from Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With the yard buried 20cm deep in snow and ice, and the tempera-
; ture lurking around 19F -7C, the fractal cats passed an unevent-
; ful day Monday curled by the nearest source of heat.  Today is 
; starting with freezing drizzle, so I predict another uneventful 
; day for the cats.
; 
; For me, the work is pretty much caught up.  Combined with the 
; abysmal outside conditions, this should give me plenty time to 
; ensconce myself indoors and find another good fractal.  If I do, 
; the fractal will appear as tomorrow's FOTD.  Until then, take 
; care, and beware of extrasensory fractals.
