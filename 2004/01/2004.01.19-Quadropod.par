; FOTD -- January 19, 2004 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD is the second one I have found with the newly 
; released Fractint version 20.3.  Other than a few minor 
; glitches in the evolver and view-window, which have been 
; corrected, I have noticed no difference in the program 
; performance.  Of course, some of the changes involve features 
; I rarely use.
; 
; In yesterday's FOTD we examined stem area of the Z^(2.003)+C 
; Mandeloid as it appears 1040 levels up the logarithmic hyper-
; spiral.  Today we turn our attention to the west, and examine 
; the 'East Valley' area of the Mandeloid.  Unlike the main stem, 
; which simply breaks into infinite bits and pieces, the East 
; Valley area smears out into a broad flat wedge with jagged 
; edges.  Today's image is located in a narrow band of chaos on 
; the southern edge of the wedge.
; 
; I named the image "Quadropod".  It reminds me of some fantastic 
; animal with four translucent arms.  Perhaps I should have named 
; it 'Study', since I spent so much time studying the background 
; colors and trying to create a smoothly blended gradient with no 
; visible bands, a challenging task in GIF format with its meager 
; 256 colors.
; 
; Though the result is not perfect, I feel I came close enough to 
; the goal of perfect smoothness to rate the image at an honest 8, 
; which, combined with the render time of just under 11 minutes, 
; gives an overall value of 73.  (To find the overall value, the 
; image rating is multiplied by 100 and the result divided by the 
; render time in minutes, making the render time like the money 
; one must pay to buy an item.  The shorter the render time, the 
; more value for the money spent.)
; 
; As always, the render time may be eliminated entirely by down-
; loading the finished image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The cold rain continued most all day Sunday here at Fractal 
; Central, changing to a few snowflakes just before ending around 
; sunset.  The high temperature never made it above 36F 2C, which 
; is far too chilly for the cats' fractal ears.  The duo spent the 
; day sleeping by the heat.  Today is starting sunny, but it is 
; very cold again.  We'll see how the cats make out.
; 
; My day looks as though it will be notably average.  Hopefully, 
; the fractal I find this evening will be notably above average.  
; Until the next FOTD appears, take care and be forever fractalish.
