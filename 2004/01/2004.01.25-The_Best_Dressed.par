; FOTD -- January 25, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The number one mystery of the day is why fractals exist.  The 
; number two mystery is why anyone would open an e-mail with a 
; subject line such as 'blnfus fgoiun sheub ksnfiyve'.
; 
; And the number three mystery is why so many of my FOTD fractals 
; rate a 6.  Today's image rates a 6.  There is nothing wrong with 
; a rating of 6 -- it's the rating I give to the greatest percen-
; tage of my FOTD's -- kind of like getting a 'B' grade in school. 
; But what I want is a series of un-inflated A's and A+'s.
; 
; The most frequent FOTD rating is a 6, which is a slightly-above-
; average fractal.  Admittedly, this situation is a bit contradic-
; tory.  How can an above-average rating be considered a group 
; average?  Well, if 90 percent of the kids in the local school 
; can be far enough above average to be on the honor roll, why not 
; 90 percent of the FOTD fractals?   :-)
; 
; Combined with a render time of 7-3/4 minutes, today's image has 
; an overall worth of 80.  It is a scene in the fractal created by 
; combining 0.25 negative parts of Z^(-5.1) with one negative part 
; of Z^(-1.5) and adding (1/C).
; 
; This parent fractal is one of the typical amorphous things crea-
; ted by negative powers of Z.  It consists of a large irregular 
; bay with a prominent bud on the southwest shore.  The southern 
; valley leading to this bay is split into two sections, which 
; made it unusual enough for me to examine closer.
; 
; The closer examination proved fruitful.  The area proved to be 
; rich with midgets of a new variety, strangely similar yet 
; strangely different.  Today's image is a sample of what lies in 
; this newly-discovered part of the fractal multiverse.
; 
; I named the image "The Best Dressed".  Whether it is actually 
; best-dressed or not is up to the viewer to decide.  But before 
; making such a decision, one must view the object in question, 
; and the way to view the object is to run the included parameter 
; file or download the completed GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Light fluffy snow fell until midday here at Fractal Central on 
; Saturday.  When it ended, 5-cm of fluffy snow was on the ground 
; and the fractal cats were completely unhappy.  The temperature 
; of 25F -4C would have been too cold for their ears even if the 
; ground had been bare.  Today is even colder, the temperature is 
; 14F -10C, the snow is still there, and much more snow is coming. 
; I have yet to break the bad news to the not-so-dynamic duo.
; 
; As for me, I'm ready to have a relaxing day doing as little as 
; possible.  I might find a great fractal or two in between spells 
; of relaxation.  And in 24 hours I will return with the best 
; fractal that I find.  Until then, take care, and the fact that 
; we can give no reason for fractal existence does not mean that 
; no reason exists.
