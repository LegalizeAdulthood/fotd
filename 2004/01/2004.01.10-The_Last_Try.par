; FOTD -- January 10, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Against my better judgement, I tried one more time to find a 
; quality image in the parent fractal I have been exploring for 
; the past several days.  Once again I came up short.  With a 
; rating of an average 5, today's image is not bad, but it is not 
; good either.
; 
; This will be my final venture into this particular fractal.  To 
; emphasize this point, I have named today's image "The Last Try". 
; The image is a harlequin kind of a thing -- patches of brilliant 
; but unorganized color and apparently random shapes surrounding 
; the usual central midget.
; 
; The image was rendered in the traditional manner, with the 
; inside set to 'zero' and the outside set to 'iter'.  Some of the 
; other options do as good a job of rendering the scene, but I 
; used the traditional method because I wanted to emphasize how 
; this particular area of this particular fractal 'really' looks.
; 
; Of course, when working with fractals, the word 'really' is 
; relative.  Fractals are actually nothing more than numbers -- 
; total abstractions.  It is what we do with those numbers to make 
; them register on our senses that creates the 'reality'.  The 
; numbers can be used to create sounds as easily as images.  The 
; numbers could also be used to create tactile impressions.  It is 
; harder to imagine how one might turn a fractal formula into 
; something that can be tasted or smelled, but stranger things 
; have happened.
; 
; Today's image renders in 26 minutes.  This, combined with the 
; rating of 5, gives a total fractal value of 19.  The image may 
; be seen by running the included parameter file or by downloading 
; the completed GIF image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Those who wish to feel, taste or smell the numbers will need to 
; invent an appropriate means of doing so.
; 
; With a temperature of 28F -2C, Friday was too cold for the cats' 
; whiskers.  They seemed quite happy to spend the day sleeping by 
; the heat.  This morning the temperature is 3F -16C, and though 
; the sun has appeared, this kind of cold is far too severe for 
; sensitive cats to be outdoors.  They will certainly be satisfied 
; with another day by the radiator and a dab or two of tuna.
; 
; I have enough work waiting to keep me busy for a good part of 
; the day.  When the work is finished, I'll have time to find a 
; fractal in a different fractal world.  In 24 hours I'll return 
; with the fractal I find.  Until then, take care, and if in the 
; southern hemisphere, keep cool.  Otherwise, keep warm.
