; FOTD -- January 03, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal continues the theme of the past 3 fractals.  We 
; combine portions of Z^(-1.7) and Z^(-1.7), and add (1/C) to get 
; a many-bayed parent Mandeloid with a separate ring of chaos 
; lying some distance to the north.  Today's scene lies in this 
; outlying ring of chaos rather than in the main body of the 
; fractal itself.
; 
; But today's image is an 'evaporated' one, in which all 'outside' 
; parts have shrunk until they vanished, so speaking of bays and 
; outlying areas of chaos makes little sense.  The escape radius 
; has been raised so high that the parent fractal has been reduced 
; to a sea of trapped points.  Luckily, these points do interes-
; ting things in their confinement, which can be revealed by 
; rendering the scene with the inside set to 'bof61'.
; 
; The trapped points that make up today's image remind me of a 
; seasonal wreath.  I named the image "Iterative Wreaths", needing 
; no reason at all for using the plural.  The rating of 7 is high 
; enough to justify the brief 2 minutes required to render the 
; image from the included parameter file.  The image may also be 
; seen by downloading it from:

;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Friday was another routine day here at Fractal Central, both 
; with the weather and the activity of the fractal cats.  The 
; pleasant winter sun and temperature of 54F 12C was just enough 
; to give the cats a couple hours in the yard.  When evening came 
; the duo was ready to settle for the night.  Today is starting 
; foggy.  We'll see what develops.
; 
; It's now time to wrap up the little work yet to be done and 
; enjoy a day with not much else to do but relax.  Between bouts 
; of relaxation, I'll find the fractal that will appear as 
; tomorrow's FOTD.  Until next time, take care, and take time out 
; to ponder a fractal.
