; FOTD -- January 02, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Fractals are for fun.  True, they have other uses, and perhaps 
; deep meanings that we are yet to fathom.  They might even be a 
; mathematical manifestation of God, but above all else, fractals 
; are fun.  And today's fractal is total fun.  I was in a fun mood 
; when I found it, and with its gaudy colors, the image looks like 
; pure fun.
; 
; The image is actually a scene in the fractal that results when 
; various portions of Z^(-1.6) and Z^(-6.1) are combined and (1/C) 
; is added.  The formula, like the last two, is whimsical.  (Most 
; likely, tomorrow's FOTD will be a play on the fractions 1.7 and 
; 7.1.)
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is a Mandeloid with four 
; main bays, the easternmost of which appears the most critical, 
; with lots of Mandel-buds and filaments that terminate in rings.  
; Several disconnected features lie a small distance to the west 
; and north of the main Mandeloid, but these play no part in 
; today's FOTD.
; 
; The midget in today's image is located near the point where the 
; filament of an eastern bud intersects its terminal ring.  To add 
; a bit of 'zip' to the scene, I rendered it with the outside set 
; to 'tdis'.  Then I named the whole thing "Just For Fun", which, 
; after all, is what fractals are the best at.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is boringly average, though the render time of 
; 3 minutes is thankfully short.  And the image may be seen even 
; faster by downloading it from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Once we got our act together here at Fractal Central on 
; Thursday, the day went very well.  There was lots of sun and the 
; temperature reached 50F 10C, just mild enough to keep the cats 
; happy during their afternoon in the holly thicket.  In the 
; evening, and against my better instincts, I went to a New Year's 
; dinner at the home of the Fractal Lady's brother -- the second 
; outing in 24 hours.  I would rather have spent the evening in 
; search of fractals, but all went well and now, when someone 
; tells me to 'get a life', I can reply that I have one.
; 
; But today is starting rainy, the dinners are past, and the cats 
; already look sullen.  Check back in 24 hours to see how things 
; turn out.  Until tomorrow take care, and if searching for 
; fractals is not 'having a life', then what is?
