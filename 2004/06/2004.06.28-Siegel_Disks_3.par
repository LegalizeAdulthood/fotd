; FOTD -- June 28, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we go from one of the slowest images of all time to one of 
; the fastest, for a kind of look at a real Siegel Disk Fractal.  
; (At least that's what the math encyclopedia calls its mirror 
; image.)  And this will be our last look of the current Siegel 
; series.
; 
; When the maxiter of today's image is raised to 100-million, the 
; inside does start to fill with some kind of debris, but then the 
; image takes several days to render.  As a compromise between 
; having a real siegel disk fractal that takes days to render and 
; an almost-siegel disk fractal that renders in a more reasonable 
; time, I lowered the maxiter to a miserly 300 and rendered 
; today's image with the inside set to 'bof61'.  When this was 
; done, the siegel disks appeared as flowers set against a clear 
; blue sky.  This doesn't quite make the invisible visible, but it 
; helps a bit.
; 
; I named the image "Siegel Disks-3".  It is the third and last in 
; the current series of these quasi-objects.  Now, if someone 
; knows where to find Herman Rings, whatever they are, I will do 
; the same with them.
; 
; The rating of an average 5 explodes to a whopping 970 when the 
; very short 30-second render time is figured in.  In this case, 
; the download will likely take longer than the rendering, but 
; visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; is still a very convenient way of seeing the FOTD images.
; 
; With the near-perfect weather continuing Saturday and Sunday, 
; the fractal duo found near-perfect happiness both days, hiding 
; in the holly thicket, wondering where the cicadas went.  The 
; good weather made no difference to me, however.  I spent most of 
; the weekend trying to get the work under control.  Some progress 
; was made, but much more needs to be done before I can totally 
; relax.  Until next FOTD, take care, and we think, therefore we 
; might exist.
