; FOTD -- June 03, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When the time came to name today's fractal, I was in the mood 
; for a slice of blueberry pie, so I named it "Blueberry Pie".  
; Unfortunately, giving the fractal such a name did not make it 
; edible, but I have left a note to pick up a blueberry pie on the 
; next visit to the market.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's scene was created by combining 
; positive and negative portions of the golden ratio.  It is not a 
; single object, but rather an assortment of Mandeloids and other 
; holes.  There are two main Mandeloids, one of them fairly 
; normal, the other all cut off, as though it were too close to 
; an escape radius.  Today's scene is located in a tiny spiral in 
; the remnants of the East Valley of this cutoff Mandeloid.
; 
; After a moment's indecision, I rated the image at a 6, which is 
; the highest rating in several days, and, when the render time of 
; 7 minutes is considered, gives an overall value of 83.
; 
; The task of rendering may be avoided entirely by downloading the 
; finished GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Between rain squalls, Wednesday was a fair enough day, with lots 
; of sun and a temperature of 82F 28C.  But even while the sun was 
; shining, the trees were dripping water, making things too wet 
; for the delicate ears and paws of the dynamic duo.  They 
; ventured onto the porch but never made it to the grass.  A minor 
; treat of extra tuna was needed to end their day satisfactorily.  
; This morning is starting slightly chilly, but it is sunny, and 
; no rain is in sight.  I expect the cats will have a better day.
; 
; For me, the work is still heavy and everyone wants his job at 
; once.  This means another busy day, so until next FOTD, take 
; care, and button down the hitches.
