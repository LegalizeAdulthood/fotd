; FOTD -- June 15, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows what happens when 1.5 parts of Z^(-1.15) are 
; combined with 1.5 parts of negative Z^(0.85) and (1/C) is added. 
; The resulting parent fractal features a stretched-out main bay 
; edged with the expected out-of-proportion buds.  Today's scene 
; is located near the tip of a filament attached to a small bud on 
; the southern shoreline of the main bay.
; 
; The scene was rendered with the outside set to 'tdis' rather 
; than the standard 'iter'.  Doing this gives interest to the 
; otherwise large areas of flat color.  The image is one of those 
; rare ones that needed almost no color tweaking, which is a lucky 
; break, considering how busy things are here at Fractal Central.
; 
; I named the image "Recursive Rosebuds".  I like the sound of the 
; phrase, which is also a fitting description of the picture.  The 
; rating of a 7 appears justified, and, combined with the render 
; time of 6-1/2 minutes, gives an overall value of 106.
; 
; The most efficient way of viewing the image is to download it 
; from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a high temperature of 88F 31C, Monday was a bit too warm 
; for the dynamic duo.  But being very bright cats, they waited 
; until late afternoon when it grew cooler before venturing into 
; the yard.  After a pleasant evening, they came indoors at 
; sunset, quite satisfied.  This morning it looks as though the 
; day will be a repeat, though today there is a chance that rain 
; will spoil their outing.  We'll see what happens.
; 
; For me, the work is what will happen.  And when the work is 
; finished, it will be time for fractals.  Until next FOTD, take 
; care, and don't take those fractals too seriously.
