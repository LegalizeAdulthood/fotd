; FOTD -- June 30, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The news on the radio this morning is that the electromagnetic 
; radiation from cell phones apparently reduces sperm-cell count 
; in men.  The evidence that EMR is harmful to not only sperm 
; cells, but to the brain cells of test animals continues mount-
; ing, yet we continue in our state of denial, claiming that the 
; harm has never been demonstrated in humans.  And why not deny 
; it?  Cell phones and computer monitors are not only convenient, 
; they are fun.
; 
; We say the radiation harms only test animals?  Do we not use 
; test animals to determine if something is harmful to humans?  I 
; wonder how long it will be before we suddenly realize that the 
; increased electromagnetic radiation in our modern world has been 
; harming us, and rush to bring class-action law suits against the 
; evil, greedy phone companies and cell-phone manufacturers, who 
; will replace the evil, greedy tobacco companies in the future.  
; And while we're at it, let's not forget the computer monitor 
; manufacturers.  Those old-style CRT monitors are also prodigious 
; radiation emitters.
; 
; Do not be deceived by today's image.  It emits no electromagne-
; tic radiation.  (The monitor emits the radiation.)  Nor does the 
; image lie on the X-axis.  It is actually a scene in the fractal 
; that results when Z^(-1) is subtracted from 1/10000 part of 
; Z^10000, and 1/C is added.  I named the image "A Myriad and 
; Unity", a name that is rather deceiving, since Z^(-1) is not 
; unity but rather 1/Z.
; 
; The typical high-order features are prominent in the image,
; which renders in a speedy 7 minutes and combines with the rating 
; of a 6 to give an overall value of 84.  The most efficient way 
; to view the image is to visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download it from there.
; 
; Perfect weather both Monday and Tuesday here at Fractal Central 
; gave the cats a chance to do anything they wanted in the yard.  
; In fact, we have had so many perfect days lately that the cats 
; are actually becoming a bit bored with life in their own yard.  
; I spotted them Tuesday afternoon exploring three yards up the 
; hill, where the neighborhood alpha tomcat hangs out.  Luckily, 
; the bully cat was off somewhere else, and the dynamic duo made 
; it back without a scratch.  Today looks to be perfect again for 
; the fractal cats.  For me, there is still a lot of catching up 
; to do.  Until next FOTD, take care, and if the earth rotated in 
; the opposite direction, the sun would move in the opposite direc-
; tion in the sky.  Would this put North America in the Southern 
; Hemisphere and Australia in the Northern Hemisphere?
