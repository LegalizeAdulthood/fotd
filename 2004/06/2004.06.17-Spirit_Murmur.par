; FOTD -- June 17, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I see that the idea of the Fractint CD is still floating around, 
; along with suggestions of what such a disk might contain.  Some-
; one, I forget who, has suggested that the Fractint CD might 
; include the 7-year series of FOTD parameter files.  This seems 
; like a good idea, since my own FOTD-CD has been bogged down for 
; several years.  The FOTD parameter files, along with the discus-
; sions, take up about 8-1/2 mb of disk space in text format, and 
; I would be willing to include them on the disk at no charge, as 
; long as the disk were distributed at no cost.  I have long since 
; realized and accepted that there would be no financial profit in 
; such a disk.
; 
; To find today's fractal scene I ventured into the Seahorse 
; Valley area of the Z^(2+0.2i) Mandeloid.  Perhaps I should call 
; it the Seahorse Mesa area, for the north branch of the valley 
; has broadened into a plateau almost as wide as the main bud.
; 
; This is a 'new' area, not part of the standard M-set, and 'new' 
; areas contain new material.  The scene illustrated in today's 
; image is certainly new, having never before been seen by human 
; (or alien) eyes.  Of course, if an infinity of infinite parallel 
; universes exist, today's image has been seen an infinite number 
; of times.
; 
; I named the image "Spirit Murmur".  The name has no connection 
; to the image, I simply like the poetic sound of the name.  The 
; rating of a 6 appears fair.  The render time of just under 9 
; minutes gives an overall value of 68, which is not too bad.  The 
; best way to see the image is to download it from Paul's FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; It is once again quiet here at Fractal Central.  The constant 
; din of the cicadas is gone.  True, an occasional male still 
; sings a lonely song, hidden is some bush or tree, but even these 
; stragglers will soon be gone, leaving only the discarded shells 
; and empty holes as a reminder that they were ever here.  The 
; cats seem totally unconcerned.
; 
; Heavy clouds, very high humidity, a temperature of 86F 30C and 
; occasional showers made Wednesday quite oppressive here at 
; Fractal Central.  But it was oppressive only for people.  The 
; fractal cats enjoyed the conditions, and despite the wet grass, 
; found time for a satisfying romp (AKA rest) in the yard.  When 
; the heaviest shower of the day drove them indoors at 6pm, they 
; were ready to settle for the evening without a treat of tuna.  
; Today is starting the same.  It looks like a repeat for the duo.
; 
; For me, it looks like another very busy day.  (Isn't success 
; wonderful.)  Until the next FOTD, which hopefully will arrive 
; tomorrow, take care, and when searching for truth, be sure of 
; how it will be recognized when it is found.
