; FOTD -- June 06, 2004 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is different.  To start, it was created by 
; raising Z to a complex power -- 1.3+0.08i.  Then I found that 
; the hyperparent spreads out and dissipates as we go up the 
; logarithmic spiral, but it condenses and becomes more interes-
; ting at the negative levels of the spiral.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image lies 16 levels down the 
; spiral.  At the default magnitude it is a tiny shrunken thing, 
; but when magnified it becomes a comet-like object, full of 
; interesting places in need of exploration.  Today's scene lies 
; in the chaos edging a valley on the southern shoreline of the 
; comet head.
; 
; No special outside rendering methods were needed with today's 
; scene.  The standard equal-iteration bands did everything.  
; Admittedly, I did help a bit with the coloring, but I did less 
; work than the first appearance would suggest.  The name, "A 
; Feathery Fractal", captures the feeling of the image.
; 
; Undecided whether to rate the image a 7 or 8, I finally decided 
; on a 7.5, which gives an overall value of 84.  This value can be 
; raised if the task of rendering the image is eliminated by down-
; loading the finished GIF file from the FOTD web site at:

;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy rain all day here at Fractal Central on Saturday and an 
; unusually cool temperature of 59F 15C kept the cicadas quiet and 
; the cats indoors.  The cicadas clung motionless in the trees all 
; day; the cats sulked in the window all day.  Sun and warmer 
; temperatures will make the cicadas happy, but a sizable treat of 
; tuna was needed to put the cats back in a good mood.  Today is 
; starting cloudy.  The rain appears to have moved on.  All we 
; need is sun.
; 
; I'm going to try to take it easy today.  If I succeed, I'll 
; consider it quite an accomplishment.  Maybe I'll start writing 
; that story I've been thinking about for at least three years.  
; Maybe not.  Until tomorrow's FOTD, take care, and be prepared 
; at least for an outburst of philosophy.  It has been building 
; for several days and could break loose at any time.
