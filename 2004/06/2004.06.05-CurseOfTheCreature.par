; FOTD -- June 05, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To find today's image we ventured into the depths of the fractal 
; that results when 0.2 parts of Z^(-8.25) are combined with one 
; part of Z^(-1.65), and (1/C) is added.  Like so many fractals 
; that are created by combining negative exponents of Z, this 
; fractal is indescribable.  Like the familiar Mandelbrot set, it 
; has bays and valleys, but the inner detail of these features is 
; totally unlike anything found in the M-set.  Today's scene is 
; located on the north edge of a valley on the positive real axis 
; of the parent.
; 
; An unusual feature of the scene is that it is not there.  The 
; scene has been 'evaporated' by raising the escape radius so high 
; that all points are trapped.  The trapped points are not dead 
; however.  They still have freedom to move around, and this 
; motion has been made visible by the 'bof61' inside fill, which 
; colors the points according to which iteration takes them 
; closest to the origin.
; 
; The image so produced appears as today's FOTD, which earns its 
; rating of a 7 quite honestly.  I have named it "Curse of the 
; Creature" in recognition of those not-so-great old movies that 
; they just don't seem able to make any longer.  There might be 
; some kind of creature lurking somewhere in the image.  If I 
; looked long enough, I'm sure I could find one.  But the image is 
; good enough as it is.  We'll keep the creatures where they 
; belong -- in the old movies.
; 
; The render time of just under 14 minutes combines with the 
; rating of 7 to give an overall value of a neat 50.  And if the 
; image is downloaded from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; the rendering will be eliminated and the value will rise.
; 
; A cloudy cool day here at Fractal Central on Friday turned into 
; light rain in the evening, but the cat duo got in enough yard 
; time before the rain began to keep them reasonably happy.  Only 
; a little tuna was needed to make their day complete.  Today is 
; starting with clouds, cool temperatures and rain.  Hopefully, it 
; will turn dry in time for the cats to have their outdoor romp.
; 
; With me, the work is mostly caught up, and the next FOTD fractal 
; will appear in approximately 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and be lucky.
