; FOTD -- February 15, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yesterday's FOTD made such an abomination of such a great scene 
; that I feel compelled to make restitution.  I do this by 
; presenting the same scene in its Mandelbrot aspect as today's 
; FOTD.
; 
; In an attempt to atone for my wrongdoing, I have given the scene 
; a new color palette, one that might be even a bit too intense.  
; But, after what I did yesterday, the midget in question deserves 
; all the help it can get.
; 
; I named the image "Mandelbrot Aspect" because that's what it is. 
; But let's not forget the five other mutually perpendicular 
; aspects of this four-dimensional scene.  The Julia aspect is 
; only one of these.  Perhaps I'll see what can be done with 
; today's midget in the other perpendicular directions and present 
; these as the next five FOTD images.  I'm once again getting the 
; urge to ponder the fourth dimension, and we all know what 
; happens when I do that.
; 
; I seem to remember writing in an FOTD discussion about five 
; years ago about a four-dimensional Titanic striking a four-
; dimensional iceberg.  I half finished the description of what a 
; three-dimensional person standing on the deck might see, and 
; then I dropped the topic.  Of course, the whole thing might be 
; pure fantasy, since stable planetary orbits are not possible in 
; spaces of four or more dimensions.
; 
; I originally rated today's image at an 8.  Then I noticed that 
; the colors were a bit too strong for comfort, and dropped the 
; rating to a 7.  But a seven is still above average, and combined 
; with a render time of 45 seconds gives an overall value of 921.
; 
; For those who would rather not render, the completed GIF image 
; is available on Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The clouds hung tough on Saturday here at Fractal Central, and 
; the temperature stopped rising before it reached 41F 5C.  For 
; proper comfort, the fractal cats demand either full sun or a 
; temperature above 50F 10C.  Since neither of these conditions 
; prevailed, the cats were not satisfied, and showed their dis-
; satisfaction by returning inside only a few minutes after they 
; had gone out and looking as unhappy as they could.  I let them 
; look unhappy for a few hours, then gave them a treat of salmon.  
; I hope they enjoyed their special treat, for the salmon is gone 
; and the next treat will be the standard tuna.
; 
; Today is the seventh day of the week.  (Our calendar is wrong.  
; Monday is actually the first day of the week.)  It's a day of 
; rest both for the Deity and the created.  And, being among the 
; created, I intend on resting.  The best source of relaxation I 
; know of is a computer screen on which a fractal is taking shape. 
; I wouldn't be surprised if that's where I find myself in a few 
; hours.  Until next time, take care, and if I was not created, I 
; must be a lucky accident.  The chances of such an accident must 
; be far greater than one in a googolplex to the googolplex.
