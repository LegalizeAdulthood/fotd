; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Golden Bud".  This does not imply that 
; the bud is a golden color.  I gave it that name because the 
; parent fractal was created by using the golden ratio, or 1.618, 
; twice.  Actually, the bud, or the interior of the bud, is an 
; electric blue color.
; 
; The generating formula of the image is Z^1.618+C.  This means 
; that each bud in the resulting fractal will have 0.618 part of 
; one lobe.  But unlike the buds of the whole Mandeloids, where 
; all buds are of a similar shape, the buds of the fractional 
; Mandeloids have no fixed shape.  The missing part of the next-
; higher whole bud can take any shape whatever.
; 
; The next-higher whole bud in today's instance is the near-per-
; fect circle of the buds of the classic Mandelbtot set.  The 
; 0.382 part of a circle that is missing has been eroded rather 
; equally from the entire perimeter, leaving a rather squat bud 
; with assorted nooks and crannies.  Some of these crannies might 
; hold some interesting scenes.  The drawback to the exploration 
; is the extreme slowness of the area.
; 
; I wanted to give the image a rating higher than the 4, but in 
; all honesty I could not.  I worked on it for my own amusement 
; rather than to make as good a picture as possible.  Combined 
; with the render time of 22 minutes, the image has an overall 
; value of 18.
; 
; The completed GIF image is available on Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; It remained very cold all day Saturday here at Fractal Central, 
; and as a result, the fractal cats remained very close to the 
; heat.  At one point, Thomas did check the conditions on the 
; porch, but the temperature of 19F -7C and lack of direct sun was 
; far too chilly for his ears.  He turned around after only two 
; minutes and came back inside to enjoy the heat.  This morning is 
; starting about the same; I suppose the cats will have a repeat 
; day.
; 
; So far, my day has been uneventful, but the fractal lady has 
; that 'lets go shopping for antiques' look in her eye.  I fail 
; to see what's so interesting about stuff that others no longer 
; want, but who knows . . . on rare occasions something worthwhile 
; does turn up.  One thing certain to turn up however is the next 
; FOTD, which will appear tomorrow.  Until then, take care, and 
; older is not always better.
