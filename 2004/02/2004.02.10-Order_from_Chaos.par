; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we tunnel quite deep into the Mandelbrot set. 
; At the end of our trip we find ourselves in a remote valley just 
; off the northwest shoreline of the main bud of the large midget 
; on the negative X-axis.  This area consists of areas of wild 
; chaos interspersed with relatively orderly and almost straight 
; filaments.  The nature of the general area, with its mixture of 
; order and chaos, is reflected quite well in today's image, which 
; I have named "Order from Chaos".
; 
; The magnitude of the image is really in the range of arbitrary 
; precision math, but I have forced the program to use the conven-
; tional math routine by including the 'mathtolerance=/1' entry in 
; the parameter file.  In such a chaotic image, the resulting 
; breakdown in resolution is barely noticeable, and the time saved 
; is a sizable part of a day.
; 
; One result of forcing the use of conventional math is the 
; unwanted stretching and skewing, which is reported on the 'tab' 
; screen of the image.  This distortion is barely noticeable, but 
; those who wish to render the image marginally more accurately 
; may be re-enable arbitrary precision math by striking the 'g' 
; key and entering the command 'mathtolerance=/0'.
; 
; The 'logmap' method of coloring does not work with today's 
; image.  The 'tdis' option runs very slowly.  The other outside 
; coloring options either create too much chaos or run far too 
; slowly.  The best method I found of coloring today's image is 
; also the simplest -- outside=iter logmap=0.
; 
; When the time came to rate the image, I was undecided whether to 
; consider the overworked nature of the M-set.  Is today's image 
; really that unusual?  After almost 20 years of exploration, is 
; there anything truly new to be found in the M-set within the 
; range of conventional math?  One would think so.  At the magni-
; tude of today's image, the entire M-set would be about as large 
; as the solar system.  And except for the X-axis symmetry, no two 
; spots of the M-set are identical.  But the differences are often 
; infinitesimal, and for all practical purposes, the major varia-
; tions have long since been found.  Considering all this, I rated 
; today's image at an above-average 6, which, with the render time 
; of just under 5 minutes, gives an overall value of 125.  I must 
; get a machine fast enough to make arbitrary precision math prac-
; tical.  Way down deep is where the undiscovered M-set goodies 
; lie.
; 
; To see the image, run the included parameter file and sit back 
; to watch the fun, or go to Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download the image from there.
; 
; The clouds moved in quickly here at Fractal Central on Monday, 
; but the temperature reached 46F 8C, which was mild enough for 
; the fractal cats to enjoy a full 90 minutes in the yard.  They 
; must have enjoyed their outing.  When the day ended, they were 
; content to settle down without a special treat.
; 
; Today brings both work and fractals for me.  The work I will 
; finish; the fractals will never be finished.  I shall return in 
; 24 hours with more goodies, some concrete, some abstract.  Until 
; then, take care, and the search for truth is all too often 
; hindered by the difficulty in recognizing and accepting it.
