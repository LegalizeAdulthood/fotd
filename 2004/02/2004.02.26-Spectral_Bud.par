; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'm busy again today, so the discussion will once again have to 
; be brief.
; 
; Today's trip takes us into the depths of the Mandelbrot set, to 
; a fine spiral and the ghost of a bud.
; 
; Images such as today's are what sparked my interest in the four-
; dimensional aspect of fractals.  When I began exploring the 
; perturbed M-sets, I found it puzzling that the low-iteration 
; features should change so quickly when the starting point of Z 
; is changed, while the high-iteration features, such as the 
; background buds, remain unchanged.
; 
; After a bit of thought, I realized that regardless of where the 
; points start, if they do not escape first, they will eventually 
; settle into the same orbits as the points that start at zero.  
; In today's image, the foreground spiral consists of the low-
; iteration points that have escaped before settling into the 
; conventional M-set orbits, while the background bud consists 
; of the high-iteration points that have endured many iterations 
; and found the time to settle into the M-set orbits.
; 
; I named today's image "Spectral Bud", which is a recognition 
; of the ghostly nature of the background bud.  
; 
; Pictures such as today's can be given a striking three-
; dimensional appearance by using the 'ranges' feature of 
; Fractint, though I lacked the time to use this feature on 
; today's image.
; 
; I could honestly rate today's image no higher than a 4.  When 
; the render time of 2-1/2 minutes is considered, the overall 
; value comes in at 152.  The image may be seen either by running 
; the included parameter file, or by downloading the completed 
; image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather was pleasant here at Fractal Central on Wednesday, 
; though it was a bit chilly.  The temperature of 43F 6C was 
; tempered greatly by a warm sun, which made the cats' two hours 
; in the yard a pleasant experience.  When the day ended, they 
; settled for the evening without complaint.  Today is starting 
; similarly.
; 
; For me, things are a bit more settled today, but still 
; relatively busy.  If all goes well, I'll finish in time to find 
; a top-rated fractal.  If not, I'll find a medium-rated fractal.  
; Until next time, take care, and find only good fractals.
