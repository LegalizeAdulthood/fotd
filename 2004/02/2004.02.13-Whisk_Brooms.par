; FOTD -- February 13, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was never supposed to be.  I announced earlier 
; today that there would be no FOTD for February 13.  But the 
; other work went faster than expected, and I managed to find the 
; time for a quick trip into the star of the period-5 radical on 
; the northeast shore of the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; I stopped at a point on an arm of the star at a magnitude just 
; before the switch over to arbitrary precision math becomes 
; necessary, and zoomed into the nearest midget.  The result is 
; pretty much as expected, with spiky filaments radiating and 
; branching from the central midget.  For some strange reason I 
; named the image "Whisk Brooms".
; 
; One benefit of stopping just before the switch over to arbitrary 
; precision math becomes necessary is the extreme speed of the 
; image, which renders in only 17 seconds.  Unfortunately, the 
; ordinariness of the scene cut a couple points off the rating, 
; but with a render time of mere seconds, even an image with a 
; rating of a 5 has an overall value of 1786, making it well worth 
; the effort of running its parameter file.
; 
; As always, the finished GIF image is available on Paul's FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A cloudy and chilly day here at Fractal Central on Thursday kept 
; the dynamic cats' outdoor time limited to under 15 minutes.  But 
; the brief outing in the 41F 5C degree air seemed to satisfy 
; them, and only a small treat of tuna was needed in the evening 
; to keep their moods livable.
; 
; The work today was heavy, but the Friday 13th jinx did not 
; appear, and the work was finished faster than at first seemed 
; possible.  Until tomorrow's FOTD, which hopefully will appear on 
; schedule, take care, and God made fractals at the same time that 
; he made the universe.
