; FOTD -- February 08, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "Jungle Lushness".  Perhaps I should have 
; named it something like "Too Lush".  The image has almost too 
; much richness.  No jungle on earth was ever as lush as the scene 
; in the image, not even in the deepest depths of the Amazon rain 
; forest.
; 
; This over-abundance of detail and color has cost the image one 
; full rating point.  After careful consideration, I could give 
; the image a rating no higher than a 6, which is still somewhat 
; above average, but falls short of the 7 that I first considered.
; 
; The parent fractal was created by combining 1 negative part of 
; Z^(-1.1) with 0.1 negative part of Z^(-11) and adding (1/C).  
; This parent is several orders too large to fit on the default 
; screen, but a single outzoom reveals the most interesting parts. 
; The interesting part of the parent consists of an oversized 
; banana-shaped hole with a Mandelbrot set lying at its southwest 
; extremity.  The banana-shaped hole splits the East Valley of the 
; M-set as it joins with the set.  Today's scene is located on the 
; shoreline of the hole, near the point where it joins the M-set.
; 
; The traditional equal-iteration-band method of rendering today's 
; scene produces a very interesting image -- almost good enough to 
; be a FOTD.  The evaporated version, which appears as today's 
; FOTD, is improved just enough to be the version I chose.
; 
; As an 'evaporated' image, today's scene consists entirely of 
; trapped inside points made visible by the 'bof61' inside fill.  
; This fill traces quite faithfully the foundation features of the 
; 'real' image that has been evaporated, but adds bells and 
; whistles that the real image never had.
; 
; Sometimes a humdrum scene can be improved by evaporating it, 
; sometimes not.  The only way to find out is to go ahead and 
; evaporate an image and see what can be done with the ghostly 
; remains.  There are also 'half-evaporated' and 'extra-condensed' 
; versions of images created by negative exponents of Z, but I 
; have yet to do much investigating in these areas.
; 
; The render time of today's image is 13-3/4 minutes.  Combined 
; with the rating of a 6, its overall value is 44 -- a value that 
; is not too bad.  The image may be seen quicker by downloading it 
; from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Saturday turned into a quite pleasant day here at Fractal 
; Central, when sun and an unexpectedly warm temperature of 43F 6C 
; prevailed most of the afternoon.  The cats enjoyed the few spots 
; where the sun is now shining above the holly trees in the early 
; afternoon, and ignored the remaining ice.  But this morning 
; things are again frozen solid.  It once again feels like winter. 
; I doubt that the duo will have a second good day.
; 
; My day will probably be average . . . most days are . . . that 
; is unless something unexpectedly good or bad happens.  Since 
; nothing like this is likely to occur, the day will probably pass 
; with nothing more notable taking place than the appearance of 
; the next FOTD fractal image.  When that happens, we will have 
; found tomorrow's FOTD.  Until then, take care, and does the 
; brain create the mind, or does the mind create the brain . . . 
; or is it all just one big fractal?
