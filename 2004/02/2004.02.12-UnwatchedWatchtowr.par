; FOTD -- February 12, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; What evil has befallen the splendid midget that appeared as 
; yesterday's FOTD?  Where we once had a lovely, perfectly 
; symmetrical pattern, we now have a mis-shapen, distorted thing 
; that is downright stressful to look at.  I have used the same 
; color palette, so what could have caused this abomination?
; 
; Actually nothing evil was done to the glorious scene of 
; yesterday.  I simply shifted my point of view, took a 
; 'photograph' of the same scene from a different direction, 
; and named the picture "Unwatched Watchtower".
; 
; As I have said often in the past, the Mandelbrot set, the 
; perturbed M-sets and the Julia sets are slices of a single 
; four-dimensional object known as the Julibrot.  Since this 
; Julibrot object is four-dimensional, it may be sliced in new 
; ways that produce neither Julia nor Mandelbrot sets, but 
; entirely new aspects of the familiar Julia and Mandelbrot 
; scenes.  Today's image illustrates what happens to yesterday's 
; "Watchtower" image when it is seen from one of these new 
; directions.
; 
; Some slices taken in new directions reveal aspects that are 
; virtually the same as the familiar Julia and Mandelbrot aspects; 
; other slices reveal grossly stretched and distorted aspects such 
; as we have in today's image.  In order to fully comprehend why 
; this is so, it would be necessary to visualize the entire inside 
; of the Julibrot, which would be difficult for even a four-
; dimensional person, not to mention a mere three-dimensional one.
; 
; To try to understand what is happening in images such as today's 
; I reduce the problem to three dimensions and imagine taking a 
; blob of white silly-putty and a blob of black silly putty, and 
; combining them into a single lump.  Then I knead the lump 
; slightly, so that the black and white putties just start to 
; blend, forming well-defined arms and filaments that twist and 
; turn through the interior of the combined blob.  Then I cut the 
; combined blob in half to reveal inside features much like those 
; in today's image.  The features have not really been stretched, 
; the apparent stretching is due to the angle at which some of the 
; twisting and turning features have been sliced.
; 
; All this stretching and distorting has taken its toll on the 
; superb original image.  Today's version is worth no more than a 
; humble 4, which equals slightly below average.  Considering the 
; render time of 7-1/2 minutes, this results in an overall value 
; of 52.  The 7-1/2 minute wait while the parameter file runs can 
; be avoided by downloading the completed GIF image from Paul's 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather on Wednesday here at Fractal Central was very 
; average, with lots of sun but a chilly temperature of 39F 4C.  
; The cats' behavior was also very average.  After an uneventful 
; hour in the yard, they came inside and settled by the heat for a 
; long sleep.  Today is starting cloudy and cold, with snow not 
; far to the south.  As long as it stays to the south, the cats 
; will not be worried.
; 
; My only concern is to get the waiting work finished, a task that 
; will take about two hours to accomplish.  Then I'll see what I 
; can find in Fractal Land.  The best of what I find will appear 
; as tomorrow's FOTD.  Until then, take care, and watch for 
; lurking Julibrots.
