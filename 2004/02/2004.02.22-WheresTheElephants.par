; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is not particularly attractive.  I warned that the 
; odd planes of the Julibrot can sometimes be stressful to look 
; at.  But it is still an interesting view of what happens to the 
; elephants in East Valley when the angle of view is changed to 
; something totally new.
; 
; In today's image we have stationed ourselves at the origin of 
; the Julibrot, which is also the origin of the Mandelbrot set, 
; and we are looking east toward East Valley.  The four-
; dimensional Julibrot figure is oriented in our 3-D space so that 
; the X-axis of the image is the imag(z) axis of the Julibrot and 
; the Y-axis is the imag(c) axis.  What we see looking east has 
; been stretched 250 times in the vertical direction.  If this had 
; not been done, the image would have consisted of nothing but a 
; few horizontal lines and bars.
; 
; And after stretching the scene, what do we see?  East Valley is 
; sometimes called Elephant Valley because the features there 
; resemble elephants.  The name is well earned.  The East Valley 
; features resemble elephants more closely than the Seahorse 
; Valley features resemble seahorses.  But here we are in East 
; Valley, and "Where are the Elephants"?
; 
; The elephants are all around us, but only bits and pieces of 
; them are recognizable.  Look closely and you will see parts of 
; trunks here and there, half-elephants touching trunks, and 
; disembodied parts of bodies scattered about in a totally 
; disorganized manner.  The elephants are here indeed, but we have 
; missed them, for, though they lie very near, they are in the 
; fourth dimension, leaving us only hints of their true nature.
; 
; After careful consideration, I decided today's image was worth 
; no more than a rating of a below-average 3.  This rating 
; combines with the render time of 2-1/2 minutes to give an 
; overall value of 119.
; 
; The finished image has been posted to Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; from where it may be conveniently downloaded.
; 
; The Saturday temperature of 50F 10C was fair enough here at 
; Fractal Central, but the wind, which gusted to over 40mph 64kph 
; was far too much for the cats, who spent most of the day sitting 
; on their shelf by the window, watching the trees blowing and the 
; birds flying by.  An extra treat of tuna in the evening restored 
; their good spirits.
; 
; With nothing much to do for the rest of today, I am going to do 
; nothing much.  Sometime this evening I'll see what I can find in 
; the Julibrot that will rate higher than today's 3.  Until next 
; time, take care, and there are more wonders in the fourth 
; dimension than can be imagined by the mind of man.
