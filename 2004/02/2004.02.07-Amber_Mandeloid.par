; FOTD -- February 07, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Here in Fractal Central territory it's the 100th anniversary of 
; a memorable day.  In the rest of the world, it's just another 
; day.  Today is the 100th anniversary of the great Baltimore 
; fire -- the world's least-known conflagration.  On this day in 
; 1904 someone threw a cigarette butt down a ventilation grate and 
; started a fire that burned over 1500 buildings in the downtown 
; area.  Only one person was reported as killed -- a drunk who was 
; pulled from the harbor -- but it has always been uncertain that 
; the death was actually due to the fire.
; 
; Refusing to admit defeat and without federal assistance, the 
; city pulled itself from the disaster and rose to be the nation's 
; largest seaport for most of the 20th century.  Only toward the 
; end of the century did the bottom fall out.  It now appears our 
; no-longer-fair city leads the nation in everything bad and is in 
; last place in everything good.  The reasons for the decline are 
; as numerous as the people still living in the city, which is 
; where I still live by less than 1/2 mile, though this will likely 
; change within two years.
; 
; The connection of the fire to today's fractal is straight-
; forward.  The fire started as a simple lit cigarette; today's 
; fractal started as a simple mathematical expression -- 
; (Z^2)-0.25(Z^3)+C.  Like so many other things of the world 
; around us, and even of the worlds within us, a fire has a 
; fractal nature.  Like fractals, a spark can find itself in con-
; ditions that are stable, neutral or unstable.  If a tiny flame 
; finds itself in stable conditions such as a burning match on a 
; concrete sidewalk, it will quickly be extinguished.  If the con-
; ditions are neutral, such as the flame of the wick of a large 
; candle, it will continue unchanged indefinitely.  But if the con-
; ditions are unstable, such as a flame in a large pile of waste 
; paper, the flame will quickly grow without limit, as did that 
; cigarette spark back in February of 1904.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image resembles a Mandelbrot set 
; rotated 180 degrees.  Its East Valley, which is now on the west 
; side, is split down the middle into two separate valleys, 
; leaving two entirely new shorelines along the interior edges of 
; the valleys.  Today's scene is located along one of these shore-
; lines, rather deep in the valley.
; 
; In this area, the 'outside' parts of the fractal do not have the 
; smooth, unbroken nature that we find in the 'outside' parts of 
; the M-set.  They are more like a swiss cheese in which the holes 
; have been organized to form a regular pattern that can itself 
; become the most important feature.
; 
; In today's image however, it is not the holes that are the most 
; important feature, it is the coloring.  The amber ring close 
; around the central midget is so brilliant that I named the 
; entire image for it.  The name I chose is "Amber Mandeloid".
; 
; The rating of a 7 that I gave the image is above average, but 
; the overall value has been cut to a measly 13 by the render 
; time of over 53 minutes.  In a few days I will adjust the 
; method of calculating the overall value, or perhaps drop it 
; entirely.
; 
; The wait of nearly an hour for the parameter file to finish 
; running may be avoided by downloading the completed image from 
; Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy rain all day Friday here at Fractal Central led to 
; localized flooding and unhappy cats.  The high temperature of 
; 36F 2C helped not at all.  It took almost a whole can of tuna 
; to restore the spirits of the dynamic duo.  Luckily, today is 
; starting better.
; 
; That's it for now.  Until next FOTD, take care, and fill in the 
; blanks before you leave.
