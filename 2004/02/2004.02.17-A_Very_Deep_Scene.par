; FOTD -- February 17, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; While working on the Julibrot rotation formula last evening, (I 
; wanted to make a few changes.), I took a short diversion into 
; the very-deep, unexplored depths of the Mandelbrot set, down to 
; where no one has gone before and the patterns around the midgets 
; are all circles.  The exact location of today's scene is on a 
; filament of a larger midget, which in turn is on a filament of a 
; still larger midget that lies on a filament extending from the 
; northern shoreline of the large period-2 bud of the M-set.
; 
; I named the picture "A Very Deep Scene", a name that needs no 
; explanation.  When the time came to rate the image, I decided on 
; a 6.  All images this deep should be at least a little above 
; average.  When the two-hour render time is considered, the 
; overall value drops to a measly 4.9.  But the value may be 
; increased immensely by downloading the finished GIF image from 
; Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; I sent the image to Paul in a separate e-mail earlier this 
; morning, so it should be posted very soon.
; 
; Monday, the Presidents' Day holiday here at Fractal Central, 
; passed like any other day.  I didn't even realize it had been 
; a holiday until the day was nearly over.  Holidays mean little 
; when every day is a holiday, filled with the joy of fractals.  
; Well, there is that slight matter of the design work that must 
; be done on schedule, but that also is more fun than labor.
; 
; The fractal cats must have agreed, for despite the below 
; freezing temperatures of 30F -1C that kept them indoors, their 
; spirits remained high.  This morning is starting cloudy, with 
; possible snow threatening.  We'll see what happens with the cats 
; if the conditions deteriorate.  For me, the immediate task is to 
; finish the modicum of work so that I can get back to the Juli-
; brot formula.  If I find anything, I'll present it as tomorrow's 
; FOTD.  Until then, take care, and though the attributes of the 
; Julibrot are impossible, we explore it anyway.
