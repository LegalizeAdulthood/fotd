; FOTD -- February 20, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Last evening I got into a discussion with the fractal lady, who 
; is of the opinion that I am spending too much time concerning 
; myself with such useless things as fractals and fantasies of the 
; fourth dimension.  She seemed to think that this is something 
; only little boys do before they grow up and learn to think like 
; sensible, practical men.  When such discussions arise, I totally 
; agree with her opinion, leaving nothing to disagree about, but 
; to myself I often wonder how useless the fourth dimension 
; actually is.
; 
; One thing the fourth dimension most definitely is good for is 
; fun.  And if Einstein had thought it childish to consider the 
; fourth dimension, what kind of world would we live in today?  
; Perhaps we would not have developed computers and discovered 
; fractals, and today's image would not exist.
; 
; Today's scene reminds me of a lake with reflections shimmering 
; off the wave tops, but it is actually a view of Seahorse Valley 
; sliced in an unimaginable direction.  These reflections needed 
; no special formula to bring them to life.  They are an actual 
; part of the Julibrot itself.  Perhaps this area should be known 
; as "Seahorse Lake", which is the name I gave the image. 
; 
; Due to time limitations, I am unable to write a description of 
; the orientation of today's image, but I will go into the 
; curiosities of four-dimensional geometry in future FOTD's.  For 
; now, enjoy the image.  It is a very fast one.
; 
; I have rated today's image at a 6, which combines with the 
; render time of just over one minute to give an overall value of 
; 508.  The image may also be viewed by going to Paul's FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A very pleasant and sunny late-winter day with a high 
; temperature of 56F 13C here at Fractal Central on Thursday 
; gave the intrepid cats a long, pleasant afternoon in the yard.  
; When evening came, they settled down without complaint.  The 
; best news is that today looks to be a repeat.
; 
; For me, the work is rather heavy, but it is under control, and 
; will be finished in plenty time for another trip to the fourth 
; dimension to find another fractal.  The fractal I find will 
; appear as tomorrow's FOTD.  Until then, take care, and the 
; everyday world we live in is four-dimensional, so what's the 
; fuss about?
