; FOTD -- February 09, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us once again to that ultimate fractal 
; reality, the Mandelbrot set, for a brief stay in one of the more 
; remote valleys.  I call the M-set the ultimate fractal reality 
; with some misgivings.  I am not certain that such a thing as 
; fractal reality exists.  As far as that goes, I am not even 
; certain that such a thing as physical reality exists.  (I am 
; reasonably certain that I exist however.)  But if anything like 
; ultimate fractal reality does exist, the Mandelbrot set comes as 
; close to filling that definition as we have yet come.
; 
; The scene of today's action lies in a spiral deep in the outer 
; side of the right branch of the valley leading to the large 
; period-4 bud on the northeast shoreline of the main bay of the 
; Mandelbrot set.  The features that appear in the image are 
; familiar to those with experience exploring the M-set.  This 
; familiarity cost the image one full rating point.  But to make 
; up for the familiarity, the coloring is somewhat unexpected, and 
; this originality added one full point to the rating.  As a 
; result, we have an image with a rating of a 7 and, due to the 
; short render time, an overall value of 321.
; 
; I named the image "Apples and Oranges".  The tiny orange spots 
; remind me of oranges.  The apples were added just to make a more 
; interesting name.
; 
; There are two ways of viewing the image: first, by running the 
; included parameter file; second, by downloading the completed 
; GIF image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; It remained sunny but breezy and quite cold here at Fractal 
; Central on Sunday.  The temperature never rose above freezing, 
; which kept Tippy the tabby indoors.  Thomas, the rusty, ventured 
; out onto the remaining ice for a few minutes before deciding 
; that comfort was the better part of valor, and hastily retreat-
; ing back inside.  They both ended the day with a treat of left-
; over salmon.  Today is starting milder.  Hopefully, it will 
; be better for the duo.
; 
; For me, it looks like today might be a bit on the busy side.  
; But unless an avalanche of unexpected work arrives, I'll find 
; time to dredge up another fractal worthy of FOTD status.  Until 
; tomorrow, when that next fractal will appear, take care, and see 
; you then.
