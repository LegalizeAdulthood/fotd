; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- February 24, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Big changes are coming.
; 
; In a year or two, Fractal Central will be moving from its 
; current location near the northeast corner of Baltimore MD to 
; somewhere in south or central Pennsylvania.  The exact location 
; is yet to be determined.  Fractal headquarters will be moving 
; because the fair city in which it is now located, (Charm City 
; they try to call it), has sunk to levels that have gone beyond 
; unbelievable to downright comical.  I'll not go into lengthy 
; details, since discussing politics on the list is off topic, but 
; as a single example, believe it or not, the city school system, 
; which recently was granted a multi-million funding increase and 
; boasts something like a 33-percent literacy rate among its 12th 
; grade graduates, is insolvent, and looks like it will soon go 
; into receivership.
; 
; Now that I have gotten that off my chest, on to the fractal.
; 
; For today's trip into Fractal Land, I have returned to the 
; traditional Mandelbrot set and the valley of the large period-3 
; north bud, where I found today's midget.
; 
; The shape of the midget is familiar.  Most of the impact, (if 
; that's what it might be called), is a result of the coloring.
; 
; I named the image "Iterative Diversion" because it is a brief 
; diversion from my excursions into the other planes of the 
; Julibrot.  The rating of a 6 combined with a render time of 9 
; minutes gives an overall value of 66.
; 
; For tomorrow's image I will show one of the strange things that 
; happens to today's image when it is viewed from a different 
; direction.  Until then, be aware that the finished GIF file of 
; the image is available for download on Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather remained pleasant all day here at Fractal Central on 
; Monday, with lots of sun and a temperature of 48F 9C.  These 
; conditions kept the fractal cats satisfied from dawn to dusk.  
; Today is starting cloudy and chilly, with the possibility of a 
; little snow.  We'll see how it goes.
; 
; For me, the work is slightly heavy -- nothing that I cannot 
; finish in plenty time to find another fractal.  So stay tuned 
; for more wonders.  Until next time, take care, and iterate well.
