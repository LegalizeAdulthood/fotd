; FOTD -- February 14, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After saying that there would be no FOTD for February 13, I went 
; ahead and posted one anyway.  If this created a minor bit of 
; confusion, those who were confused have my apologies.  This 
; morning I found a note from Paul, suggesting that I post my 
; FOTD's the night before the day on which they are due.  This is 
; a good idea.  I will resume doing this in the near future.  I 
; shifted to morning posting because I am always more alert and 
; energetic in the mornings, and can write better.  I will adjust 
; my schedule to write the FOTD's a full day in advance, on the 
; morning of the day before, and post them the evening before.
; 
; The "Unwatched Watchtower" FOTD of two days ago showed a 
; distorted version of a fine midget in the Mandelbrot set.  In a 
; letter with quirky spelling that was posted to the Fractint list 
; on Friday, SherLok Merfy commented that the image was a mixture 
; of Mandelbrot and Julia features.  In a way, this is what the 
; image of two days ago is.
; 
; Today's image consists of the same mixture.  It is not a 
; Mandelbrot image; it is not a Julia image.  It is not actually 
; a distortion of either of these.  It is a legitimate aspect of 
; the Julibrot in its own right.  By returning to the default 
; magnitude, keeping the (p1) and (p2) parameters unchanged and 
; changing only the (p3) and (p4) parameters, the entire fractal 
; world glimpsed in today's image can be fixed and thoroughly 
; examined, a world as varied as the Julia and Mandelbrot worlds 
; themselves.
; 
; But as today's image shows, this new world is not all beauty.  
; Like the 'real' world, it holds scenes that are not pretty.  
; Also like the real world, these not-very-attractive scenes hold 
; a strange fascination, and with a bit of effort can be turned 
; into works of art -- kind of like turning a sow's ear into a 
; silk purse.  Today's image demonstrates a bit of this artistic 
; regeneration.
; 
; The regeneration was not great, but it was enough to raise a 
; total loser to a rating of a 5, which is average.  There is 
; actually a fine Mandelbrot midget or Julia set lying at the 
; center of the basin in the image.  All that is needed to see 
; one of these aspects is to rotate the point of view to the 
; proper direction.
; 
; I named today's image "Unwhisked Whiskbroom" because it is a 
; distortion of an area similar to the one that appeared in 
; yesterday's image.
; 
; The render time of 5-1/4 minutes combined with the rating of 5 
; produces an overall value of 96.  The image can be seen and 
; perhaps enjoyed by running the parameter file or by downloading 
; it from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Friday started very busy here at Fractal Central, but the rush 
; was cleared away far sooner than expected.  This made the 
; fractal cats quite happy.  (They get jealous when I give the 
; computer more attention than I give them.)  The weather was 
; pleasant, with sun and a temperature of 45F 7C.  This made them 
; even happier.  When they ended the day with their faces in their 
; food dishes, eating a treat of salmon, no less, their happiness 
; was complete.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy but mild.  Anything could happen both 
; in the 'real' world and in the fractal world.  Check back in 24 
; hours to see what the 'anything' turns out to be.  Until then, 
; take care, and if you don't find a fractal lying on the side-
; walk the next time you go out walking, look for a meme.  They 
; are almost as rare.
