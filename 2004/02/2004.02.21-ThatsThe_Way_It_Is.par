; FOTD -- February 21, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a simple view of the Julia set of Seahorse 
; Valley.  If this is doubted, start the included parameter file, 
; then bring up the X screen, drop the maxiter to 100 and restart 
; the image.  After a few seconds, the screen will show a near-
; perfect Julia set with the inside colored a brilliant orange.  
; Why then did I choose this very-familiar Julia set to be the 
; FOTD for today?
; 
; The answer is obvious when the maxiter is raised to 1000000.  
; The Julia set turns out to be not a Julia set after all, but 
; rather a slice of the Julibrot that has been double-rotated 1/10 
; of 1 degree from the Julia orientation.  (Double rotation is a 
; new motion, not possible in 3-D space.)  This slight rotation 
; has made a great change in the resulting almost-Julia fractal, 
; which is now magically filled with curious detail.
; 
; The detail filling the Julia set is actually a greatly magnified 
; image of the Oblate aspect of Seahorse Valley.  It has been 
; magnified 573, or tan(89.9), times in fact.  (The Oblate aspect 
; is what appears on the screen when the real(z) and imag(c) axes 
; of the Julibrot are pictured.)  To see the unmagnified oblate 
; aspect of Seahorse Valley, change the real(p1) and real(p2) 
; parameters to zero.  This can be done in equal increments to 
; make things more interesting.
; 
; Now, to prove that it is actually Seahorse Valley we are 
; investigating, drop the maxiter to 1000 and change the imag(p1) 
; and imag(p2) parameters to zero, while leaving the real(p1 and 
; p2) parameters at zero.  If this is done in equal increments, 
; you will see the Mandelbrot set gradually take shape and rotate 
; into its proper position, with Seahorse Valley at the center of 
; the screen.  It has been Seahorse Valley we have been investiga-
; ting all along.
; 
; This magnification of the Mandelbrot aspect as the Julia 
; orientation is approached is one of the most puzzling things in 
; the Julibrot.  I am reasonably certain of what is happening 
; here, but a visualization is totally beyond me.  In fact, I 
; cannot even come close.  All I can do is sit back and say 
; "That's the Way It Is", which is the name I gave the image.  The 
; rating of a 5, when adjusted for a slow render time of almost an 
; hour, gives an overall value of 8.5.
; 
; The hour wait for the parameter file to run may be cut drastic-
; ally by visiting Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the completed image from there.
; 
; A very pleasant Friday here at Fractal Central made for very 
; happy cats.  The temperature reached only 52F 11C, but the wind 
; was light and the sun, which is just now clearing the holly 
; trees in the afternoons, was warm, making the cats' time in the 
; yard very pleasant.  At the end of the day no treat was needed.
; 
; For me, the work is heavier than usual for a Saturday.  But it 
; is nothing that cannot be finished in time to find a fractal.  
; Until next FOTD, take care, and do fractals exist on the planet 
; Pluto?
