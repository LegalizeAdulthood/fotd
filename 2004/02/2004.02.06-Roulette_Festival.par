; FOTD -- February 06, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For some reason, when I studied today's image in search of a 
; name, I thought of a roulette wheel.  Then I noticed the 
; carnival-like colors, and named the image "Roulette Festival".  
; The scene illustrated in the image lies in the fractal that 
; results when ten parts of Z^(-1.3) are combined with one part of 
; Z^(-13) before (1/C) is added, and the whole thing is iterated 
; at a maxiter of 256 with an escape radius of 100.
; 
; This parent fractal is an oversized thing with many supernume-
; rary bays and valleys.  To find today's image I ignored the many 
; obvious bays and valleys, and checked a small area of chaos on 
; the southwest edge of the part of the fractal that fits on the 
; default screen.
; 
; When I first saw the inner details of this area, I had little 
; hope of finding a midget there, but, being intrepid, I pushed 
; onward into the wilderness, drawn by an unknown power.  The 
; progress was slow at first, with one dead end after another.  I 
; went farther -- into a tiny sub-area of chaos.  Once again 
; things looked bleak.  All around me were the chaotic areas that 
; I knew held no hidden midgets.  But one of those chaotic areas 
; was different -- it was doubled in a symmetrical manner.  There 
; at last, at the center of symmetry, I found my quarry.  The 
; trophy appears as today's FOTD.
; 
; The image rates a 7.  Combined with the render time of just over 
; one minute, its overall value comes in at a whopping 614, which 
; is totally out of proportion.  I really must change the way I 
; calculate overall value.  As it is now calculated, the render 
; time has far too much importance.  Perhaps I should do something 
; like multiply the regular rating by the reciprocal of the square 
; root of the render time.
; 
; Well, that's a problem for another day.  Today's problems are 
; small.  The image may be viewed by running the attached para-
; meter file or by visiting Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the finished image from there.  Both methods 
; require about the same amount of time.
; 
; Clouds and freezing temperatures kept the fractal cats confined 
; to the indoors on Thursday.  Their moods showed their disappoint-
; ment, though the evening treat of tuna cheered them somewhat.  
; Today is starting with freezing rain and a coating of ice.  I 
; assume the rain is still freezing.  The outside sensor of the 
; F.C. thermometer is covered in ice, and reads 32F 0C.  This may 
; or may not be accurate, since the reading cannot rise above 
; freezing until the ice melts.  With rain and ice prevailing, I 
; expect further deterioration in the cats' moods.
; 
; It looks like a rather slow day for me.  The work is minimal and 
; with the roads slippery no new work is likely to arrive.  I'll 
; probably spend a good part of the day in Fractal Land, wherever 
; that is.  The best of what I find there will appear as tomor-
; row's FOTD.  When I finish my trip in Fractal Land, I might 
; start thinking about things such as the nature of reality, and 
; we know what happens when I do that.  Until the next FOTD, take 
; care, and fractals must prove something about reality, but I'm 
; not sure what.
