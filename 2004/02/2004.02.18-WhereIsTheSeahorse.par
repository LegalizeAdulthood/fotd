; FOTD -- February 18, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Since yesterday, I have reworked the Julibrot rotation formula 
; and given it a new name.  The only change is that the angles of 
; rotation are now entered as degrees rather than fractions of pi. 
; This makes it easier for me to work with.  It's hard enough 
; trying to think in four dimensions without doing the conversion 
; math.  The new formula is included in the parameter file at the 
; bottom of this letter, but the [frm:] that I have inserted in 
; front of the formula name must be removed before the formula can 
; be copied into a formula file.
; 
; Using the new formula, today's image takes us to the area we 
; know and love so well -- Seahorse Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  
; But where are the seahorses?  Actually, they are in the picture, 
; but they are distorted to such a degree that they have become 
; totally unrecognizable.
; 
; The thing we know as Seahorse Valley is actually nothing more 
; than a particular part of a two-dimensional slice down the 
; center of the four-dimensional Z^2+C Julibrot figure.  This 
; slice is known as the Mandelbrot set.  But Seahorse Valley is 
; not limited to two dimensions.  It actually extends off into two 
; more dimensions, both of which are perpendicular to the familiar 
; Mandelbrot aspect of the valley, making the entire valley a true 
; four-dimensional object.  These two extra dimensions, when 
; displayed on the screen, create the familiar Julia set associ-
; ated with Seahorse Valley.
; 
; A slightly distorted version of this Julia set may be seen by 
; making one full outzoom from today's image.  The Julia set is 
; distorted because it is not a true Julia set.  The orientation 
; of the image on the screen has been slightly rotated in four 
; different directions from the true Julia orientation.
; 
; The spirals appearing on the tips of the valleys are Julia 
; features which are familiar enough, but what is that straight-
; edged border cutting diagonally through the scene?  It is not 
; part of a Julia set, nor is it a part of the Mandelbrot set.  It 
; is the edge of something entirely new, which I call a bridge, a 
; true 4-D object totally impossible for mere 3-D beings to 
; visualize.  These straight edges are one of the most common 
; features of the odd slices of the Julibrot, and make up an 
; entire world in themselves.  We will be seeing many more of them 
; as we delve deeper into the hyperspace of four dimensions.
; 
; Today's image, which consists mostly of gaudily colored spirals 
; and a straight edge, has been named "Where is the Seahorse".  
; The name was inspired by the fact that, though the scene is 
; Seahorse Valley, no seahorses are recognizable.
; 
; The comb-like fringes throughout the image are true features, 
; and not artifacts.  These fringes are also very common in the 
; odd slices of the Julibrot, especially in the areas associated 
; with Mandelbrot valleys.
; 
; Sometimes these odd slices are rather unpleasant appearing, as 
; illustrated by today's image, which I could rate at only a 5.  
; Taking the render time of 23 minutes into consideration gives an 
; overall value of 21.
; 
; Today's hyper-image may be seen by starting the parameter file 
; and sitting back to watch the fun, or by downloading the 
; finished GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; thereby saving time but missing the fun.
; 
; The temperature reached 36F 2C and the clouds increased 
; threateningly on Tuesday here at Fractal Central, but the 
; forecasted snow never arrived.  The cats not only approved of 
; the situation, they actually found the courage to endure over 
; 1/2 hour in the yard at the warmest time of the day.  And when 
; evening came, no treat was needed.  Today is starting sunny and 
; milder.  It should be an even better day for the local cats.
; 
; For me it will be an average day.  Most days are.  And when I 
; start pondering the fourth dimension, that will also be part of 
; an average day.  Until next FOTD, take care, and where does one 
; look to find this fourth dimension we hear so much about?
