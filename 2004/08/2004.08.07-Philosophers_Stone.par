; FOEFD -- August 07, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Following advice that appeared on the Fractint list, and 
; feeling a bit disappointed with the recent irregular FOTD 
; postings, I have decided to temporarily change the title of my 
; fractal postings from the FOTD to the FOEFD.  Until further 
; notice, the 'Fractal of the Day' will be known as the 'Fractal 
; of Every Few Days'.
; 
; Today's FOEFD takes us back to the Mandelbrot set, which is 
; just about the only thing I have time for nowadays.  The area 
; under investigation is the third valley of the north period-3 
; bud complex.
; 
; The area is a difficult one, requiring an extreme maxiter and a 
; magnitude that presses the limits of the conventional math 
; routine.  In fact, the magnitude in excess of 2*10^13 required 
; me to insert the mathtolerance entry into the parameter file.  
; The result of all this effort is a midget very like those that 
; have been seen many times before.
; 
; In an effort to bring a little life to the scene, I rendered it 
; with the outside set to 'real', but even this left some areas 
; boringly flat.  I could probably have done better with the 
; coloring if I had had the time.  As it is, the image rates a 4, 
; which is only a little below average.  The render time of 23 
; minutes gives an overall value of 17.
; 
; I named the image "Philosopher's Stone" for some reason that I 
; have now forgotten.  The philosopher's stone was supposed to be 
; a magical stone that could somehow change base metals into gold. 
; Alchemists spent their lives searching for it.  I doubt that any 
; ever found it.
; 
; If all goes well, over 23 minutes can be saved by downloading 
; the GIF file of today's image from the FOTD (FOEFD) web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Since the name change to FOEFD is temporary and a bit frivolous, 
; the internet address of the web site will remain unchanged.
; 
; Except for a brief thunder-shower Wednesday evening, the weather 
; here at the original Fractal Central has been near perfect for 
; intrepid cats.  The slightly-less-intrepid human had little time 
; to enjoy the conditions however.  Today is starting near perfect 
; once again.  The cats will be happy; the human will be working.
; 
; And the next FOEFD will appear in a few days as promised.  
; Until that moment arrives, take more than care, and live a 
; fractal life.
