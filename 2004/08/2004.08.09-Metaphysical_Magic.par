; FOEFD -- August 09, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a tiny midget in a remote valley of a 
; sub-bud on the northwest shore of the main period-2 bud of the 
; Mandelbrot set.  It is everything that might be expected of a 
; midget in this particular location, which really is not all that 
; much.
; 
; As I study the image, several questions come to mind.  The first 
; question is 'how can I attract a larger FOTD following if I keep 
; admitting in the discussions that the FOTD fractals are not very 
; good?'  The next question is 'how can I claim that the fractals 
; are good when I feel they are not?'  The third question is 'how 
; can I present good fractal images when I lack the time to find 
; and develop them?'  An unrelated question is 'how soon will the 
; aliens from Alpha Centauri invade and take over the earth?'
; 
; Considering all these fractal problems, I could rate today's 
; image at only a lowly 4.  As is always the case, with more time, 
; I could have produced a better rendering of the scene.  As for 
; those aliens from outer space, the existence of which skeptics 
; still doubt, only the government co-conspirators know when the 
; invasion is coming and we will all be spirited off to the slave 
; labor camps on the far side of the moon.
; 
; I named today's image "Metaphysical Magic".  After all, fractals 
; are metaphysical, and a metaphysicist is a scientist doing 
; rational science without the benefit of a laboratory.
; 
; And now, the work is again piling up, and I find my thoughts 
; wandering from the fractal topic.  I guess this means it's time 
; to post this FOEFD and get busy on other things.  The overall 
; worth of today's image is 97.  The finished image can be found 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Perfect weather on Saturday and Sunday made the cats perfectly 
; happy.  They spent two long afternoons in the cool shade of the 
; holly trees at the bottom of the yard.  Today looks like a 
; repeat, which will likely give them another good day in the 
; yard.  For me, the work is slowly yielding to persistent effort. 
; The end is in sight, but it is still quite far off.  The next 
; FOEFD will appear in a few days.  Until then, take care, and I 
; sometimes wonder whether fractals have minds that can think 
; rationally.  I suspect they do not, but I am not certain.
