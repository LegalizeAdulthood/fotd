; FOTD -- August 04, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The continuing rush here at Fractal Central shows little signs 
; of abating.  But the fractals keep coming.  And why not?  The 
; FOTD is becoming so automated that it takes little more than 10 
; minutes of my time.  The question now is, 'can good fractals and 
; interesting discussions be found automatically, and if they can, 
; what does this say about the worth of fractals in general?'
; 
; Today's hastily-found image takes us deep into the east branch 
; of the valley of the period-3 bud on the north shoreline of the 
; main cardioid (bay) of the Mandelbrot set.  I searched for all 
; of two minutes before finding this familiar-looking scene, whose 
; only redeeming features are a too-high logmap value and a little 
; extra attention given to the coloring.
; 
; The too-high logmap is the cause of the flat background, which 
; is not all bad, since it gives the overall scene the appearance 
; of brilliant little beads floating in infinite space.  
; 
; I named the image "For Ever and Ever More", and rated it at a 4, 
; which fits well with the fourth day of the month.  When the 
; render time of over 15 minutes is figured in, the overall value 
; rates a 26.  When the completed GIF image is downloaded from the 
; FOTD web site, the overall value has little meaning.  The comple-
; ted image may be found at:

; 
; Monday and Tuesday were warm and muggy here at Fractal Central, 
; but no rain fell and the dynamic fractal cats had two good days 
; in the yard.  Today is starting similarly.  It again looks good 
; for the duo.  For me it looks like more work waiting to be done, 
; but that's nothing new.  Until next time, most likely in a day 
; or two, take care, and if you find life too filled with worries, 
; become a nihilist.  Then you will have nothing to worry about.
