; FOTD -- July 27, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The most recent FOTD took us to a scene deep in East Valley of 
; the classic Mandelbrot set.  Today's FOTD takes us to a scene 
; deep in North Valley of the cubic Mandelbrot set.  Just as East 
; Valley is located on the real axis of the quadratic M-set, 
; North valley is located on the imaginary axis of the cubic 
; M-set, and most of what is true of East Valley is also true of 
; North Valley.
; 
; The main difference is that, in today's image, triangles are 
; everywhere instead of squares.  And the features surrounding 
; the small central midget are arranged in ascending powers of 3 
; rather than powers of 2.  The cut-off nature of the elements is 
; again very prominent, though not so obvious as in the most 
; recent 'deepeast' image.
; 
; The terraced effect of the image was achieved by rendering it 
; with the outside set to 'tdis'.  The image is also rather 
; striking when rendered using the conventional 'equal-iteration-
; band' method.
; 
; I named today's image "Deep in the North" and rated it at a 7.  
; The overall value rates an 11.  The image does not use a 
; super-fast hard-coded formula, but rather a formula I wrote 
; several years ago.  The result is a parameter file that takes 
; over 53 minutes to run.  Luckily, the pre-rendered image will 
; soon be available for download on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Sunday was cloudy and cool, but dry -- temperature 72F 22C.  
; Monday was partly sunny and quite pleasant (81F 27C) here at the 
; Old Fractal Central, soon to be moved to the New Fractal 
; Central.  Today it is raining.  The cats enjoyed both Sunday and 
; Monday.  It's too early to see how they will take today's 
; conditions.
; 
; I don't know about the cats, but I'm going to make it a 
; work-day.  We still have quite a bit of work to put behind us.  
; The next FOTD will appear in 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and cheer up.  Life is just a big fractal 
; hologram.
