; FOTD -- July 31, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As can be inferred by the delay in the appearance of the FOTD 
; and the shortness of this discussion, things are really hopping 
; here at the old Fractal Central.  The fact that we will soon 
; start the search for a fractal central merely complicates 
; matters.  I will keep the FOTD going as best I can until the new 
; Fractal Central is up and running, but the frequency will have 
; to be cut back.
; 
; Today's image is a scene deep in the northwest valley of the 
; quartic Mandelbrot set.  I rendered it with the passes=b, which, 
; with this particular fractal, is the fastest and also the most 
; fun.
; 
; I named the image "Deep Northwest" in keeping with the names of 
; the two most recent images.  I rated it at a 4 because the theme 
; is becoming a bit stale.  The render time of almost 1/2 hour can 
; be cut by several orders of magnitude by downloading the 
; completed GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A series of torrential rain showers interspersed with full sun 
; kept the dynamic duo confined to the indoors all day Tuesday 
; here at Fractal Central.  The fractal basement escaped with 
; nothing worse than a few puddles.  Wednesday was far more 
; pleasant, with morning showers but a mostly sunny afternoon, and 
; a temperature of 84F 29C.  The cats enjoyed three pleasant hours 
; in the holly grove, while I enjoyed the work I managed to 
; finish.  Thursday was dry and pleasant all day.  Friday turned 
; warmer and muggy.  The cats were happy but I was very busy.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in a day or two or three.  Until then, 
; take care, and are fractals physical objects, abstractions, meta-
; physical ideas, something in between, or something entirely new?
