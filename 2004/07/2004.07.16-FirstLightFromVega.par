; FOTD -- July 16, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's quickie image takes us to a midget on a filament of a 
; larger midget lying on the x-axis of the Mandelbrot set.  This 
; larger midget is found just beyond the tip of the stem of the 
; very large midget at -1,75.  From a distance, the image reminds 
; me of a star blazing brilliantly in the middle of a vast nothing-
; ness.  I named it "First Light from Vega" accordingly.  This 
; star seemed appropriate, since it is bluish like the image, and 
; passes directly overhead in the evening at this latitude at this 
; time of year.
; 
; Though the magnitude of the image demands arbitrary precision 
; math, the magnitude lies just beyond the range of conventional 
; math, and, aided by the x-axis symmetry, renders in only 5 
; minutes on my tired old P200 machine.
; 
; I rated the image at a 7.  Considering the less-than-three-
; minutes I spent on the coloring, the colors turned out surpris-
; ingly well.  When the render time is figured in, the overall 
; value rates 142.
; 
; The most convenient way to see the image is to download it from 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The fun way is to run the included parameter file.
; 
; A muggy Wednesday brought several light showers to F.C. -- just 
; enough to wet the grass and keep the dynamic duo's paws damp.  
; Thursday was near perfect, and the duo made the most of it.  
; Today looks to be near perfect again.  The question is whether I 
; will make the most of it.  The next FOTD will appear in 24, 48, 
; or 72 hours.  If I ever get my other business caught up, the 
; FOTD will resume its regular daily appearance.  Until next time, 
; take care, and are positivists positive of their positivism?
