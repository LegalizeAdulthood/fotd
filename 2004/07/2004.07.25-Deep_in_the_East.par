; FOTD -- July 25, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Deep in the East".  The name indicates 
; that it is a scene located very deep in East Valley of the 
; Mandelbrot set.  The center real coordinate of 0.250007... 
; indicates exactly how deep in East Valley the scene lies.  The 
; imaginary value of -0.0000000296... shows the narrowness of the 
; valley at the real value of 0.250007.
; 
; The maxiter of 1,300,000 might be a bit excessive, but it 
; indicates the difficulty of exploration in this area of the 
; M-set, where most of the elements in the image have a maxiter of 
; well over 10,000.  The magnitude of 8*10^12 emphasizes the 
; difficulty of the area.  The mathtolerance entry in the 
; parameter file is needed to assure that the image renders at the 
; correct magnitude and does not slip into arbitrary precision 
; math, which would cause the image to take at least 72 hours to 
; finish.
; 
; The most striking thing about the image is the 'pinched-off' 
; nature of the elements.  This 'pinched-off' effect is common in 
; the deeper parts of valleys.  The entire scene is located in the 
; shallow part of an 'elephant-trunk' spiral, the location being 
; reflected in the curving elements surrounding the midget.
; 
; I rated the image at a 6, since I feel it is a bit above average 
; in fractal worth.  When adjusted for the render time of 26-3/4 
; minutes, the overall value registers a 22.  That value may be 
; increased by downloading the completed image from the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A warm showery day Friday led to a dry cloudy and cooler day 
; Saturday.  The cats went no farther than the covered porch on 
; Friday, but enjoyed several pleasant hours in the holly thicket 
; on Saturday.  Rain is threatening again today, so it remains to 
; be seen how the cats will make out.  As for me, I plan on taking 
; it as easy as possible, ignoring the overdue work until tomor-
; row.  Until the next FOTD appears, take care, and meditate for 
; fractal serenity.
