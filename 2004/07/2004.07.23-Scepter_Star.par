; FOTD -- July 23, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is fast as lightning.  9.77 seconds is hard to 
; beat.  The speed is especially impressive when it is realized 
; that I once did a fractal that took over 17 days to complete, 
; and even then it never made the exalted group of fractals 
; known as FOTD's.  I have long since lost track of that 2-1/2 
; week image, but as I recall, it was so routine that I would 
; have discarded it even if it had rendered in 2-1/2 minutes.
; 
; Just as a long render time does not necessarily make a fractal 
; good, a short render time does not necessarily make a fractal 
; bad.  Today's image lies in the gray border area between good 
; and bad.  It is what one would expect at this depth of the 
; Mandelbrot set in the vicinity of the large midget at -1.75 on 
; the X-axis.  I rated it at a 5 accordingly.  When the near 
; instant render time is considered, the overall value rates an 
; obviously artificially high 3067.
; 
; The exact location of the image is in a scepter in a slight 
; spiral on the northern shore of the third bud on the main stem 
; of the largest midget.  I named it "Scepter Star" for descrip-
; tive reasons.  The fastest way to see the image is to run the 
; included parameter file.  If you are not set up to conveniently 
; run parameter files, the best way is to download the completed 
; image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Wednesday and Thursday were typically hot sultry days here at 
; Fractal Central.  The duo of cats made the most of things by 
; spending both afternoons in the shade of the holly trees, which 
; are already filled with the green berries that will turn red as 
; cold weather approaches.  By the time the showers arrived on 
; Thursday evening, the cats were ready to come indoors.  I passed 
; the time trying to catch up the backlog of work.  I'm almost 
; thinking of sending some of it to be done elsewhere, but I have 
; not quite yet made the decision.  The next FOTD will appear in a 
; day or two.  Until then, take care, and keep a stiff upper 
; fractal.
