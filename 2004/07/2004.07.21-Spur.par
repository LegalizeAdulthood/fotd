; FOTD -- July 20, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD is another one done in haste, and since nothing is 
; richer than the Mandelbrot set, today's image takes us there.  
; The area in question is the north shoreline of the bud centered 
; at -1.38 on the X-axis, where I checked a narrow neck on one of 
; the scepters and found today's scene.
; 
; I named the image "Spur".  That's the first thing I thought of 
; when I saw it.  I rated it at a 5, which is all I could do for 
; an image that was found almost automatically.  The render time 
; of 41 minutes results in an overall value of 12.
; 
; The most efficient way of seeing the scene is to give Paul a 
; chance to render and post it, and then download it from the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The events of the past few days, the details of which I will not 
; go into at this time, have caused me to make a decision -- to 
; move Fractal Central from its present location at the northeast 
; corner of Baltimore, MD to some yet-to-be-determined location in 
; Pennsylvania, far from spreading big-city problems.  It is 
; difficult and unfortunate to have to leave the city I have lived 
; in for the better part of my life, but I have already postponed 
; the inevitable far too long.  I will follow my many acquaintan-
; ces who have departed over the past few years, and leave the 
; fate of the city to the fools who are running it.  The FOTD will 
; continue; the business will lose some old customers and gain 
; some new ones.
; 
; A cool rainy day on Sunday, with a temperature of 68F 20C,  kept 
; the two fractal cats indoors.  Partly cloudy skies and a temper-
; ature of 82F 28C on Monday gave them an enjoyable afternoon in 
; the yard.  Lots of sun and 88F 31C made Tuesday a bit too warm 
; for outdoor romping, but the duo still enjoyed the shade.  The 
; happy cats gave me a chance to tighten the work gap, but much 
; yet remains to be done.  In 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours I will return 
; with the next quickie FOTD.  Until that golden moment arrives, 
; take care, and be alert for fractals wandering aimlessly along 
; the roads.
