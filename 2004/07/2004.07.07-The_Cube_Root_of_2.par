; FOTD -- July 07, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "The Cube-Root of 2".  The reason is 
; simple -- the exponent of Z is 1.26, which is approximately the 
; cube root of 2.  I have complicated things a bit by drawing the 
; fractal as it exists 70 levels down the hyper-something created 
; by multi-valued complex-logarithms.  (This something might or 
; might not be an actual spiral.)
; 
; The parent fractal is the nearly shapeless thing that would be 
; expected to be created by exponents in this low range.  Its most 
; interesting part lies on its west border, where a nest of 
; filaments appear to be trying to form a theme.  Today's image 
; lies near a node in this nest of loosely-organized filaments.
; 
; Filaments.  This is one thing that fractals in this range have 
; an abundance of.  They are easy sources of midgets, but the mid-
; gets have a tendency to all look the same -- like spiny undersea 
; creatures.  Today's midget, if that is what a theoretical but 
; invisible object at the center of the image can be called, is 
; surrounded by filaments different enough to almost create a 
; theme pattern.  The effect is striking enough to make the image 
; worthy of being declared FOTD for July 7.
; 
; The rating of a 6 and render time of four minutes (on my tired 
; old fractal machine) combine into an overall value of 146.  It 
; is up to the individual fractalist to decide whether to run the 
; attached parameter file and wait a couple minutes or to download 
; the completed image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Monday was 95F 35C hot here at Fractal Central, until a brief 
; heavy thunder-squall cooled things notably at 6pm.  Tuesday was 
; sunny and cooler, but the strong sun and high temperature of 88F 
; 31C still made things uncomfortably warm.  The cats made the 
; best of the conditions.  Today is starting sunny and warmer.  It 
; looks like another day of overheated cats.
; 
; For me, it looks like a lot of work, so my intuition tells me 
; it's time to get started working.  Until next FOTD in a day or a 
; few, take care, and be fair.
