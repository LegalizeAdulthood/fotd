; FOTD -- September 11, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I am really quite busy today, but not so busy that I have no 
; time for a short FOTD.
; 
; Today's image shows a midget deep in the fractal that results 
; when various negative portions of Z^(-1.33) and Z^(-13.3) are 
; mixed together and (1/C) is added.  The parent fractal is little 
; more than a scattering of rings with an occasional Mandelbrot 
; set thrown in.  Today's image is located in the East Valley of 
; the largest of these M-sets.
; 
; I named the picture "Fractal Test".  I was testing screen resolu-
; tions on the new computer when the image casually appeared.  It 
; was good enough to be declared FOTD for September 11, so that's 
; what I did.  The rating of a 7 might be just a bit over-rated, 
; but if so, not by much.  The render time of 16 minutes results 
; in an overall value of 44.
; 
; On more of a philofractal note, today is the third anniversary 
; of the day I experienced certain precognition and my world-view 
; changed.  The change was not on a political level as much as a 
; philosophical level.  Three years ago, it was demonstrated very 
; spectacularly to me that the world as it appears to the senses 
; is only a part of reailty.  Before that day I had merely suspec-
; ted that this is the case.  This means that our very successful 
; scientific method, based as it is upon the input of the senses 
; alone, must be incomplete.  It also means that the faculty of 
; reason, powerful as it might be, but also tied to the senses, 
; is not the ultimate means of finding truth.  And it means that 
; at least some of the crazy paranormal stuff that can not possi-
; bly exist, does in fact exist.  I wonder how much more of the 
; so-called 'supernatural', in addition to precognition, might 
; exist.
; 
; A far more rational thought is to save time by downloading the 
; completed GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Except for a brief minor shower Thursday afternoon, which barely 
; dampened the cats' spirits, Thursday and Friday were pleasant 
; here at Fractal Central, with a temperature that hung around 82F 
; 28C, and lots of sun.  Today is passing equally pleasant, which 
; means more happy cats.  With the new computer up and running, 
; things are once again showing signs of coming under control.  
; This means that the FOTD will resume its daily schedule sometime 
; not too far off.  But the very next FOTD will appear in no less 
; than 48 hours.  Until then, take care, and the fact that things 
; are not as they seem need not cause alarm.
