; FOTD -- September 17, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Due to a small but hurried job, today's FOTD will be short.
; 
; Today's image takes us to the northeast shoreline of the main 
; bay of the Mandelbrot set, where we explore rather deep into the 
; inland side of the north branch of the valley leading to the 
; period-6 bud.  We find a midget there, with a much smaller 
; midget in its eastern suburbs.  This smaller midget and its 
; surroundings are illustrated in today's image.
; 
; It is a very chaotic area, which is the reason for the name.  
; But there is enough order in the chaos to add features of 
; interest.  Due to the work rush, I had little time to color the 
; image, which is a little shy on the green.  As a result, I could 
; rate it no higher than a 4.  The render time of under 5 minutes 
; gives an overall value of 81.
; 
; The pre-rendered image is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; There were lots of clouds here at Fractal Central on Wednesday 
; and Thursday, but only a few periods of rain.  The cats managed 
; enough outdoor time while it was dry to keep them happy.  But 
; today is very cloudy and promises to turn far wetter.  The cats 
; could be headed for a bad day.
; 
; It looks like a rather busy day for me.  And the time to get 
; started is now.  Until 48 hours passes, take care, and don't get 
; too meta-anything.
