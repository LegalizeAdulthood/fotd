; FOTD -- September 29, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When today's image appeared on the screen, it took me no more 
; than 10 seconds to think of the name "A Blobby Fractal".  The 
; elements filling the screen reminded me of that old movie 'The 
; Blob', one of my favorites. . . . Well, let's admit it, all the 
; junky old movies are my favorites.  (That original blob was 
; finally done away with by electrocuting it, or was that how they 
; eliminated 'The Thing'.  Maybe I'm remembering wrong and it was 
; 'The Thing' that was electrocuted, and the blob that was frozen. 
; I guess I'll have to play one of my old videotapes.)
; 
; Today's image is part of the fractal that results when 1/100 
; part of Z^(-100) is combined with (1/Z) before C is added.  This 
; parent fractal at first appears nearly hopeless, consisting of 
; overlapping flat disks with scalloped edges.  The few areas of 
; interest appear where the scalloped disks overlap.  Today's 
; scene lies in one of these areas.
; 
; The image is actually a rather attractive one, well worth its 
; rating of an above-average 6.  The render time of 10 minutes 
; gives an overall value of 60.  The completed image may be down-
; loaded from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Clouds moved in on Monday here at Fractal Central, but the rain 
; held off until after dark, giving the fractal cats a full day in 
; the yard.  The heavy rain that fell most all day Tuesday caused 
; much flooding in the local area and kept the duo confined to 
; their shelf by the window, uncharacteristically resigned to 
; their fate.  Luckily, the fractal basement escaped with nothing 
; more than a puddle along the side wall.  Today is starting 
; mostly cloudy and breezy.  If no more rain breaks out, the duo 
; will have a marginal day.
; 
; For me, the serious work is basically caught up.  All that needs 
; to be done is to get the workplace in order and to keep things 
; caught up.  The next FOTD will appear on Oct. 1, when the every-
; day schedule will in all probability resume.  Until then, take 
; care, and enjoy the endless wonders.
