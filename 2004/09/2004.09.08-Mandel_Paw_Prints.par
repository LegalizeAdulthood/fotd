; FOTD -- September 09, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene on a filament of a small midget on a 
; larger filament on the northeast border of the largest bud of 
; the Mandelbrot set.  On my tired old P200 machine it renders in 
; 32 minutes.  On the new 3200mhz unit it renders in just under 8 
; minutes, and that is without any optimizing.  The new machine 
; properly displays the VESA super-VGA resolutions up to SF7, 
; which is 1024x768x256.  It almost manages SF9.  Since I have 
; done no optimizing, I could probably get Fractint running 
; significantly faster if I tried.  I could also probably make the 
; SF9 resolution work.  I have noticed several program quirks, 
; such as sudden slow-downs in the rendering speed, which likely 
; could be worked out.  Since the new unit probably will not be 
; used for fractals for some time yet, I have not yet decided to 
; exert the effort of optimizing it for Fractint and working out 
; the quirks.  But when things get caught up, I probably will.
; 
; I named the image "Mandel Paw-Prints".  And why not?  The name 
; is as good as any other I might have thought of.  When adjusted 
; for the render time of 32 minutes, the rating of 6 gives an 
; overall value of 19.
; 
; As I remarked above, the image renders in 32 minutes.  I have 
; been reading of some access problems with the FOTD web site, but 
; I have had no problems in accessing the site.  If all goes well, 
; much time can be saved by downloading the finished GIF file from 
; the web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; If all does not go well, the parameter file is included below.
; 
; Unsettled weather over the past few days made for unsettled 
; cats.  For some reason they got into a tussle Wednesday after-
; noon -- a very undignified thing for such aged cats to do.  
; Luckily the treat of tuna topped with cheddar cheese restored 
; their good moods.  I'll try to have the next FOTD ready by 
; Saturday the 11th.  Until then, take care, and Saturday will be 
; the third anniversary of the day on which I realized that pre-
; cognition, which is intuitively impossible, does in fact exist.
