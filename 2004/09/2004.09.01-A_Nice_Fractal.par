; FOTD -- September 01, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I am currently involved in unpacking and setting up a new 
; graphic-design computer for Fractal Central, so the discussion 
; for today will be terse.  Nothing unusual in that.
; 
; For the first FOTD of September I wanted a nice fractal, one 
; that would be interesting.  I wanted something that could be 
; found in a hurry.  It did not need to render in under a minute, 
; as I could always do other things while the image was rendering.  
; But above all else, it needed to be nice.  I found such an image 
; in the fractal created by subtracting (Z) from 2 parts of Z^(-2) 
; and adding (1/C).
; 
; Today's image is nice.  I leave it to the viewer to decide what 
; the word 'nice' means when applied to a fractal.  And the image 
; is also interesting.  'Interesting' is what one says about some-
; thing when they do not really like it but do not want to offend 
; its creator.
; 
; I named the image "A Nice Fractal" because it is a nice fractal. 
; I do kind of like the sawtooth effect surrounding the unusually 
; prominent midget.  I rated it at a 5 because it is a nice 
; fractal.  But when the render time of over 42 minutes is consi-
; dered, the overall value rates a measly 12, which is not so 
; nice.
; 
; But overall values are subjective things at best, and today's 
; rather low value may be bypassed by downloading the finished 
; image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Here at Fractal Central, Monday was cloudy, but the rain stayed 
; away.  Tuesday was partly cloudy with a temperature of 84F 29C.  
; The cats enjoyed ample time in the yard on both days.  Today is 
; starting sunny and pleasant.  I expect a repeat.  For me, things 
; will not settle down until I get the new machine loaded and 
; running.  It is yet to be determined how well it will work with 
; Fractint.  Until next FOTD, take care, and fractals are not real 
; but they do exist.
