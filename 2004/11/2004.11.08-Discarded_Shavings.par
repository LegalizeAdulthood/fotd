; FOTD -- November 08, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we venture into the mandel(fn||fn) formula to search for 
; any goodies that might lie therein.  When working with the 
; formula, I soon discovered that when the second function is set 
; to sqr and the shift value is set to zero, the formula draws a 
; Mandelbrot set regardless of the first function.  Then, as the 
; shift value is slowly increased from zero, spurious debris 
; gradually appears in the Mandelbrot set, finally overwhelming 
; and totally obliterating the set.  The different first functions 
; create different kinds of debris.  To create today's image, I 
; chose a first function of exp and a shift value of a very small 
; 0.006.
; 
; The resulting Mandelbrot set had strange new features in the 
; centers of the buds and main bay.  I chose the feature in the 
; center of the largest bud to be FOTD for today.  The name 
; "Discarded Shavings" came about because the image reminds me of 
; a pile of wood shavings.  The rating could not be above a 5 
; because the colors could use more work.  More importantly, the 
; parent fractal, which can be seen with a single outzoom, might 
; well be better than today's FOTD itself.  In fact, I would rate 
; the parent fractal at a 6.
; 
; The rating of 5, when adjusted for the render time of 1 minute, 
; gives an overall worth of a rather inflated 477.  The image may 
; be viewed by running the included parameter file or by download-
; ing it from the FOTD web site at:
;

; 
; With a high temperature of 71F 22C, full sun, and light winds, 
; Sunday was spectacular here at Fractal Central.  The fractal 
; cats must have agreed, for they were so enthusiastic that they 
; got into a minor fight in the yard.  Thomas walked away with a 
; scratched nose; Tippy walked away the victor.  Today is starting 
; mostly sunny but much cooler.  The cats have made up.  We shall 
; see how the rest of the day goes.
; 
; For me, the day will most likely be acceptable.  With any luck 
; at all, tomorrow's fractal will be acceptable also.  To see if 
; the luck happens, check back here in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and don't let the lack of daylight darken your outlook.
