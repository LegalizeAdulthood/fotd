; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we tackle the manfn+zsqrd formula, a formula 
; that multiplies Z by one of the functions, adds Z^2, then adds 
; C.  The result of this trickery is a formula that draws fractals 
; that are basically distortions of perturbed Mandelbrot sets.  In 
; fact, some functions actually do draw perfect M-sets as well as 
; the familiar perturbed sets.
; 
; In today's image I used the 'trunc' function, which is a 
; function I very rarely use.  Like the 'floor' 'ceil' and 'round' 
; functions, it rounds off the calculation and therefore breaks 
; the image into large discrete chunks.  I usually find the 
; fractals created by these functions too chopped up to be of much 
; interest, but today's parent fractal is intact enough to be 
; considered a single entity, which makes it worth further 
; investigation.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's scene consists of a single large 
; Mandelbrot set surrounded by smaller sets.  Some of these 
; smaller sets are pretty much intact, others are cut off.  
; Today's scene lies in the northern branch of the Seahorse Valley 
; of a midget that sits some distance west of the large M-set.  
; Only the west half of the midget is there; the east part has 
; vanished into limbo.  The name "Truncated Minibrot" refers to 
; the larger cut-off midget in whose Seahorse Valley today's scene 
; lies.
; 
; Perhaps because I was surprised at how well the 'trunc' function 
; worked, I rated today's image at a 6.  The render time of just 
; under 17 minutes results in an overall worth of 35.  By download-
; ing the finished GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; time can be saved and the overall worth can be forgotten.
; 
; A sunny but chilly Sunday here at Fractal Central, with a 
; temperature of 50F 10C, was just fair enough to let the cats 
; enjoy over an hour in the yard.  Their evening moods reflected 
; the improved conditions, making an extra treat unnecessary.  
; Today is again starting chilly, but it is expected to turn 
; warmer by afternoon.  It looks like another acceptable day for 
; the duo.
; 
; As for me, the moderate amount of work before me will be behind 
; me by noon.  Then it's on to the fractals.  Very possibly I'll 
; find something of real interest.  Until next time, take care, 
; and know that every fractal takes you closer to infinity.
