; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was created by the next formula in line, the 
; 'marksmandelpwr' formula, which was proposed by Mark Peterson.  
; This formula is set apart from the other mandelbrot formulas by 
; the function coefficient C that is initialized for each pixel to 
; Z^(Z-1).  It draws quite a variety of fractals, some of which 
; are very interesting.
; 
; With only a limited time to become familiar with the formula, I 
; obviously have missed most of what it can do, but even in the 
; short time I worked with it, I found today's 7-rated image.
; 
; I named the image "The Evil Masque".  I used the fancier 
; spelling for the word 'mask' just to be cute.  Actually, a 
; masque is a masquerade ball rather than a covering that 
; disguises the face, so today's image, which resembles a leering 
; alien face, could more properly be titled "The Evil Mask".
; 
; To produce the mask, I set the function to 'tan' and the inside 
; to 'atan'.  The object that I rotated -90 degrees and turned 
; into a mask is right on the surface of the resulting fractal.
; 
; The leering face effect is even more striking when seen from 
; across the room.  The unusually smooth color gradients go a long 
; way toward giving the impression of reality.  Unfortunately, I 
; can not take credit for the color palette.  The program did most 
; of the work, leaving me only a few registers to tweak.
; 
; Such an evil apparition surely deserves a high rating.  I rated 
; the image at an appropriate 7.  The render time of a mere minute 
; gives an overall worth of 552, but all things such as rendering 
; and overall worths can be ignored by downloading the finished 
; image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The clouds hung heavy all day here at Fractal Central on Monday, 
; but the temperature was a mild 59F 15C, and the rain was limited 
; to a sprinkle that fell after dark.  The fractal cats managed 
; enough outdoor time to keep their moods bearable.  Today is 
; starting cloudy but dry.  The cats will likely have a similar 
; day.
; 
; My work is rather heavy today, but not heavy enough to keep me 
; from the fractals.  So until next time, take care, and don't be 
; a gloomster, be a fractalist.
