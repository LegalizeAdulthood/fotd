; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us on in our tour of Fractint to the 
; 'magnet2j' formula, certainly the most complex formula in the 
; program.  Like the other magnet formulas, it has something to do 
; with temperature and magnetized materials, but I have no idea of 
; the details.
; 
; Unfortunately, I did not find much excitement in this formula.  
; I finally decided on an image that is more an unsuccessful study 
; of coloring than a noteworthy fractal.  I named the picture 
; "Iterative Fragments" for no special reason.  I am not sure why 
; the formula was so un-productive.  Maybe I simply failed to find 
; the great fractal scenes that lie in it.
; 
; Looking at the image reminds me of standing near the edge of a 
; cliff, with fragments of fractal something floating in the air 
; at the edge of the cliff, blocking out part of the infinite sky 
; beyond.  From the colors of the objects I would guess they are 
; partly translucent, for a bit of the background light seems to 
; be filtering through.
; 
; My description sounds interesting, but being a realist, I could 
; rate the image no higher than a 3.  It is a fast one however, 
; and its speed gives it an overall worth of 240.  For tomorrow's 
; FOTD I'll tackle the Mandelbrot version of the same complex 
; formula.  I might be able to find something better there.
; 
; Today's less-than-excellent image may be found posted on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; It rained steadily all day Thursday here at good old Fractal 
; Central, and the temperature hovered around 45F 7C, leaving the 
; fractal cats with nothing to do but sit sulking on their window 
; shelf, watching the rain and studying the occasional waterlogged 
; squirrel.  Only an extra treat of tuna in mid-afternoon kept 
; them from becoming totally miserable.  This morning has dawned 
; sunny, but the wind is up, and cats of the fractal persuasion do 
; not like high wind.  We shall see how their day goes.
; 
; For me it's work before fractals.  Things are getting back to 
; normal.  Fractal Lady is still a bit testy, but not as testy as 
; she was yesterday.  It looks like an acceptable day coming.  
; Regardless of what happens, I'll have the next fractal ready by 
; the time today ends, and I'll post it tomorrow at the same time.  
; Until then, take care, and when the Julia side of things looks 
; bad, check the Mandelbrot side.
