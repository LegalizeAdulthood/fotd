; FOTD -- November 03, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After being up almost all night watching election returns, I 
; find myself a bit logy this morning, but still with enough 
; energy to post the traditional FOTD.  (Yes, the FOTD can almost 
; be called traditional.  In April of 1997 when I posted the 
; first FOTD, if anyone had told me that I would still be as 
; enthusiastic in November of 2004, 7-1/2 years later, I would 
; have laughed.)
; 
; Today, we continue our tour of the Fractint formulas.  Moving 
; past an interesting series of orbit-type formulas, we reach the 
; first of the 'Magnet'-type formulas.  I know little about these 
; formulas, though it appears they were derived from the behavior 
; of magnetic materials rather than being written for the purpose 
; of creating fractals.  I would assume they only coincidentally 
; create interesting fractals.
; 
; I created today's fractal image using the magnet1j formula.  
; This formula is quite complex, and I have no idea of what it 
; tells us about magnetic material, but it makes attractive 
; fractals, one of which appears as today's FOTD.
; 
; I named the image "Ruby-Red" for its strong ruby-colored 
; elements, though its most impressive feature may be the green, 
; filled-in midget Julia set at the center.  Other Julia sets of a 
; similar shape are scattered throughout the image.  Curiously, 
; these other sets are open on the inside.
; 
; To add interest to an otherwise routine image, I rendered it 
; with the outside set to 'real'.  It is this option that causes 
; the battlement shape so obvious in the bands in the ruby areas.
; 
; I rated the image at a 6, perhaps a bit liberally.  The render 
; time is a fast 2-1/3 minutes, which gives an overall worth of 
; 253.  The fastest way of all to see the action of the magnetic 
; materials is to download the completed GIF file from the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather turned surprisingly pleasant here at Fractal Central 
; on Tuesday.  The dynamic fractal cats had a great day in the 
; yard, where they slept early and slept often.  The temperature 
; of 70F 21C was perfect.  Today is starting with more clouds, but 
; a little blue sky is showing.  Only time will tell what kind of 
; day the duo will have.
; 
; For me, it will be another average day.  The commercial work is 
; still caught up, meaning the fractals will continue coming on 
; schedule.  The next one will arrive in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and keep your chin up.
