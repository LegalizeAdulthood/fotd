; FOTD -- November 06, 2004 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today, we reach the last of the magnet formulas, the magnet2m 
; formula.  The image for today is perhaps the best to be derived 
; from the magnet formulas.  The scene is located in the center of 
; a valley of its parent, which is a fractal filled with valleys.
; 
; I named the image "Magnebrot" as a description.  A rating of a 7 
; would reflect the effort I put into coloring the original image. 
; But there is a problem.  The colors are optimized for the 
; monitor on which they were created.  Unfortunately, every one of 
; my 5 computer monitors displays a slightly differently colored 
; image, and I assume the situation is even worse out there on the 
; monitors in the broad expanse of fractal land.  The effect I 
; originally achieved is visible on only the original monitor.  On 
; machines other than the one on which the image was created, the 
; rating can be only a 6.  As a result, the final rating is 6-1/2.
; 
; The render time of 2-1/3 minutes results in an overall worth of 
; 273.  The completed GIF image is available on the FOTD web site 
; at:

; 
; Brisk winds and a temperature of 54F 12C here at Fractal Central 
; kept the fractal cats subdued on Friday.  They spent only 20 
; minutes in the yard before jumping onto the window sill asking 
; to be let in.  The standard treat of tuna eased their displea-
; sure.  Today is starting sunny, less windy, and milder.  This 
; bodes well for the fractal duo.
; 
; For me it means no excuses.  The fractal yard is deep in fallen 
; leaves and the hints that I should clear them away are very 
; strong.  But nevertheless, I will find time for a fractal.  
; Tomorrow's formula is the 'mandel'.  The fractal should be easy 
; to find.  Until then, take a lot of care, and care what you take.
