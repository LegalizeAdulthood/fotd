; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal was created with the 'manowar' formula, a 
; formula that draws Mandelbrot-type fractals.  I have no idea 
; why the formula was given such a name.  Maybe the writer got 
; the formula to draw something that resembles a man-of-war.
; 
; While working with the formula, I was struck by the fact that 
; the images it draws seem to have no truly trapped points.  All 
; the apparent inside areas that I was able to find can be filled 
; in by a sufficiently large maxiter.  Sometimes, the maxiter must 
; be as large as 1,000,000,000 but the end result is always an 
; image with no trapped points.  I did these fill-in tests at a 
; very small image size however, so I could have missed a truly 
; open area or two.
; 
; Today's scene lies in a perturbed parent fractal.  It is a very 
; fine example of the type of feature I call a dry lake.  These 
; 'dry lakes' start out with the symmetry that indicates a midget 
; lying at their center, but the lakes eventually dry up, as has 
; happened at the center of today's image, which is quite symmetri-
; cal but has no midget.
; 
; I named the image "Man-of-War Jungle".  I gave it this name 
; because it was created with the manowar formula and some of the 
; elements look a bit like palm trees.  Other viewers might see 
; something else in the image, but I see a jungle.  The rating of 
; a 6 is perhaps a bit high, but I did put some extra effort into 
; the coloring, and IMO this justifies the name.  The render time 
; of over 6 minutes results in an overall worth of 94.
; 
; The man-of-war may be seen more conveniently by downloading the 
; completed GIF image from the FOTD web site at:

; 
; The temperature reached 65F 18C here at Fractal Central on 
; Tuesday.  The wind was light and the sun was bright.  These are 
; perfect conditions for fractal cats, who, like all other cats, 
; demand comfort.  The fractal ones were out from 11am until 
; sunset, which is before 5pm at this time of year.  They were so 
; tired when they came in that they almost forgot to eat.  Today 
; is starting just as warm but with more clouds.  The duo should 
; once again be comfortable.  With no huge work backup before me, 
; my comfort depends only on finding a proper fractal in the next 
; formula.  Check here tomorrow to see my degree of comfort.  
; Until then, take care, and find happiness lies in the fourth 
; dimension.
