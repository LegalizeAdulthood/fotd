; FOTD -- November 30, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we move on to the Julia version of the 'quat' 
; formula, and find that the world of eight dimensions has 
; suddenly revealed new and unexpected variations of the familiar 
; Julia sets.  For today's image I chose one of the most familiar 
; Julia sets, the set associated with Seahorse Valley, and, fixing 
; the real(p1) parameter at -0.75, I rolled out the evolver and 
; started changing the other five.
; 
; The unexpected variations that appeared on the screen seemed 
; infinite.  With so many interesting possibilities, which one 
; should I choose?  I started flipping a coin.  The image that was 
; fortunate enough to be the last to be eliminated appears, with 
; its parameters rounded, as the FOTD for today.
; 
; An image that was chosen by chance rather than discretion can 
; hardly be expected to be a prize winner.  Today's image 
; therefore rates a 4, which is one point above the rating of 
; yesterday's funny face.  The minimal rating gets a boost from 
; the render time, which at only 13-1/2 seconds, gives an overall 
; worth of 1798 to the image.
; 
; The download is available on the FOTD web site at:

;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A fine but slightly chilly day here at Fractal Central on 
; Thursday made for rather contented cats.  They wished the 
; temperature had gone higher than 48F 9C, but did not complain 
; until they came inside at sundown, when they shouted loudly for 
; extra tuna.  They got their wish.  Today is starting partly 
; cloudy, but rain is supposedly on the way.  Hopefully, it will 
; hold off until after the cats have had their outing.
; 
; My day will be good enough if I finish the work before 3pm.  
; Right now, it looks like I'll have no trouble.  And then it's on 
; to the FOTD.  So until next time, take care, and watch for those 
; lurking fractals.
