; FOTD -- November 04, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things have been a bit un-smooth here at Fractal Central for the 
; past day or so.  The fractal cats are well enough, but the 
; fractal lady has been sullen ever since her candidate lost the 
; election.  Last evening I told her to save the left-over loser's 
; bumper stickers because the stickers might become valuable in 
; the future.  I was only joking, but she became very irate with 
; me, and since then conditions here at F.C. have not been very 
; conducive to finding great or even average fractals.
; 
; But despite the sulking and bickering I managed to find a 
; fractal in the magnet1m formula.  This formula is the Mandelbrot 
; version of the magnet1j formula, and it draws similar images 
; filled with bits and pieces of Mandelbrot sets and midgets 
; rather than with Julia sets.
; 
; The scene I chose to explore lies in one of the main valleys of 
; the parent fractal.  At the center lies the familiar Mandelbrot 
; midget.  The name "Lime Green" refers to the color of the 
; prominent elements surrounding the midget.  The rating of a 4 
; indicates that I put little effort into the image.  Due to the 
; brief 2-1/2 minute render time, the overall worth of 157 is 
; exaggerated.
; 
; The final result can be accessed at the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; There was just enough sun on Wednesday, and, with a high of 59F 
; 15C, just enough warmth to keep the fractal cats moods bearable. 
; They went out at noon and were in by 3pm.  They spent the three 
; hours sleeping and chasing moving patches of sunlight. This 
; morning is rainy, so the cats will not be happy this afternoon. 
; I fear extra tuna will be needed.
; 
; For me it's work before fun.  The next FOTD image will appear at 
; this same time tomorrow at this same place.  Until then, take 
; extra care when you're in the doghouse with fractal cats.
