; FOTD -- November 02, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal was calculated by the next formula in line, the 
; 'lambdafn' formula, which is another formula that one must 
; become familiar with before its maximum potential can be 
; realized.  I worked with the formula less than an hour, so it is 
; questionable whether the formula's maximum potential actually 
; has been realized in today's image.  My opinion is that nothing 
; out of the ordinary has been achieved, and I rated the image at 
; at an average 5 accordingly.  The render time of 22 seconds 
; raises the overall worth to a shocking 1351.
; 
; The image looks exactly like the sun as seen through a fractal 
; desert sandstorm, and that is what I named it.  The 'recip' 
; function is responsible for the grittiness that fills the frame, 
; though I am responsible for the wan color of the sun feebly 
; shining through the dust and sand in the upper left corner.
; 
; The swirling sand clouds are truly fractal.  This airborne sand 
; maintains its totally random appearance, with occasional false 
; hints of a pattern, all the way down to the limit of resolution. 
; This might be the actual nature of the formula or it might be 
; due to a quirk in the math routine.  Whatever it is, the result 
; is striking enough to earn the status of FOTD for today.
; 
; To see the sandstorm, put on your goggles and run the included 
; parameter file.  It runs in a lightning-fast 22 seconds.  Or 
; forget the goggles and download the completed GIF image from the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Monday was another near-perfect day here at Fractal Central, 
; with lots of sun and an afternoon temperature of 66F 19C.  The 
; cat duo enjoyed it to the fullest, and when the time arrived to 
; return, they came in without complaint to enjoy their supper of 
; tuna and turkey.  Today is again starting sunny, but rain is in 
; the forecast.  Hopefully, the rain will hold off until the duo 
; has enjoyed another pleasant day in the fractal yard.
; 
; For me it looks like another day -- vote, work, then on to the 
; fractals.  The best fractal I find will appear as tomorrow's 
; FOTD.  Until then, take care, and regardless of the outcome, we 
; will all win.
