; FOTD -- November 11, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal takes us on to the mandellambda formula.  This 
; formula draws two Mandelbrot sets touching butt-to-butt, with 
; two East Valleys positioned as though they were 'North' and 
; 'South' valleys.  The position makes little difference in the 
; appearance of the inner detail however.  These two valleys are 
; 'East' valleys all the way down.
; 
; I chose a scene in a narrow part of an elephant-trunk spiral in 
; the 'North' valley, and zoomed in on a midget there.  The midget 
; appears as today's FOTD.  As can be seen at once, it is a 
; typical East Valley midget, holding little that has not been 
; seen before.  As a result of this lack of originality I could 
; rate the image no higher than a 6, even after putting some extra 
; work into the colors.
; 
; For some reason I named the picture "Fire in the Hole", most 
; likely because of the fiery reds, oranges, and yellows.  The 
; phrase is the warning to take cover shouted by miners when the 
; explosive is in the hole in the mine wall and the fuse is lit.  
; I doubt that mine blasting is still done this way, though the 
; warning cry might still be used.
; 
; The image is not the best of all time, but with an overall value 
; of 221 it is worth a look.  The image may be seen by copying 
; this message into your Fractint directory, with a .par exten-
; sion, and running it as any other parameter file, or by download-
; ing the image directly from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A temperature of 50F 10C here at Fractal Central on Wednesday 
; was marginal to say the least, but the bright sun and light 
; winds made it bearable for the fractal cats, who passed several 
; hours keeping the yard clear of invading tomcats.  Only a small 
; treat was needed to end their day on the up side.  Today will be 
; warmer; the duo should be happy.
; 
; I see no potential problems arising in my department.  The work 
; is basically up-to-date, and the fractals keep coming.  The next 
; fractal will arrive in 24 hours, so check here at that time to 
; see what appears.  Until then, take care, and maybe we should 
; organize a protest about fractal inequality.
