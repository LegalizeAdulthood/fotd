; FOTD -- November 18, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I was working with yesterday's formula, which is the 
; Mandelbrot version of today's manowarj formula, I could find no 
; truly open areas in which the points are definitely trapped.  
; This does not mean such areas do not exist, only that if they 
; do, I found none of them.  Today's Julia version continues the 
; same trend.  True, a large open area does lie at the center of 
; today's image, but the area is not truly open.  It shrinks as 
; the maxiter is increased, and with a large enough maxiter would 
; likely vanish entirely.
; 
; With today's image I can see why the formula is named manowar.  
; The shape in the picture looks just enough like a drifting 
; portuguese man-of-war to inspire its name.  In the twisting 
; elements of the image, the tentacles swirling in the currents 
; can be imagined, as I suppose the sting can also be, at least 
; by those who have been stung by one of these colonies of 
; jellyfish.
; 
; The magnitude of the image is a measly 3.4, yet it takes almost 
; one hour to render on my worn-out P200 unit.  (It renders in 
; just under 7 minutes on my fastest machine.)  The slowness is 
; due to the unusually large maxiter of 250,000 and the lack of 
; periodicity to speed things up in the large pseudo-open area.
; 
; As for a rating -- I could give the image only a 5.  It is 
; basically a slight enlargement of half of the parent fractal -- 
; something that most casual explorers would come upon.  To make 
; matters worse, when the render time of almost one hour is taken 
; into consideration, the overall worth registers a nearly 
; worthless 8.7.
; 
; But all is not lost, for the rendering wait can be eliminated by 
; downloading the already-rendered image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Wednesday turned out to be a repeat of Tuesday here at Fractal 
; Central, with lots of sun and a temperature of 61F 16C.  The 
; cats had another great day.  Today is starting cloudy and not 
; quite as warm.  The cats will likely find it good enough, but 
; only time will tell for sure.  My good day will be delayed until 
; the unexpected large design job now before me is put behind me.  
; The next FOTD fractal will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and be an activist for the environment.  Go out and Demon-
; strate against a butterfly catastrophe.
