; FOTD -- November 01, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The days when I received 3 or 4-hundred spam e-mails a day have 
; been gone for a while.  I have been using Earthlink's spam-
; blocker for about a year.  But some of the stuff (10 to 20 per 
; day) still gets through, and sometimes this trickle is good for 
; a laugh.  I couldn't help but laughing this morning when I saw a 
; letter with a subject line that told me something I had never 
; imagined.  The line read: 'You can live and work in the USA'.  
; When I stopped laughing, I wondered why anyone would want to 
; come to a country where the politicians who run it are forever 
; telling us how bad the conditions are.
; 
; Luckily, today's fractal is a lot better than the state of the 
; USA.  It rates a 7.  This combines with the render time of well 
; under three minutes to give an overall worth of 259.  I named 
; the picture "Lambda Land".  Why not?  It certainly is a scene in 
; the land of Lambda.
; 
; The image was created by Fractint's lambda(fn||fn) formula.  
; This formula is tricky.  It is rather hard to get it to do 
; interesting things, but as today's image shows, it has great 
; potential.  I had worked with it for nearly an hour, trying 
; different functions and shift values, and had found nothing even 
; close to being good enough for a FOTD.  Then, with the functions 
; set to atanh/sin, and a mostly blank screen before me, I set the 
; inside fill to bof61 and actually lowered the maxiter.  I fin-
; ished the image by setting the small area of 'outside' stuff to 
; 'tdis'.  The result is today's image with its cheerio-like rings 
; and flashy colors.
; 
; Almost all of the image consists of 'inside' stuff.  Most of the 
; other inside fills work nearly as well with this strange image 
; that tries to hide its potential.  The color palette could 
; perhaps use a bit more green, but I enjoy reds, blues, and 
; purples.  The orangish highlights add just enough interest to 
; raise the image to its rating of 7.
; 
; Today's FOTD may be seen by running the included parameter file 
; or by downloading it from the FOTD web site at:

; 
; Sunday turned into the best day in several weeks here at Fractal 
; Central.  The warm sun and temperature of 77F 25C were just what 
; the fractal cats needed to chase away the cat blues.  They spent 
; the entire afternoon in the yard, mostly sitting and watching, 
; but leaping up to chase an occasional falling leaf.  The day 
; ended with the duo enjoying their evening meal.  This morning is 
; starting with sun and cooler temperatures -- conditions that can 
; be found acceptable by dignified fractal cats.
; 
; My day was not quite as good as the cats'.  The trick-or-treat 
; goblins were quite active around sundown, but all-in-all it was 
; a satisfactory day.  Today it's back to work and then back to 
; fractals, the next of which will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and don't drown in the functions.
