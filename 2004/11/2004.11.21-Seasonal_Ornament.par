; FOTD -- November 21, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal takes us onward to the marksjulia formula.  I 
; had a bit of a problem with this formula, which draws Julia sets 
; identical to those drawn by the classic Z^2+C formula.  As far 
; as I could tell, the extra parameter does nothing more than 
; multiply the number of lobes of the Mandelbrot version and 
; change the size of the Julia sets drawn by the Julia version.  I 
; was unable to find anything that could not have been created 
; more simply by the more simple julia and mandel formulas.
; 
; To find today's image, I set the parameter to 4 and checked the 
; Julia sets associated with one of the four resulting Seahorse 
; Valleys.  To avoid too obvious a repetition of an image that 
; could just as easily have been done by the julia formula, I 
; rendered today's image with the inside set to 'zmag' and the 
; outside set to the color 001.  The resulting image, though 
; obviously a Seahorse Valley Julia set, is different enough to 
; qualify as FOTD for November 21.  In fact, it is different 
; enough to rate a 7.  When adjusted for the render time of 3 
; minutes, the rating gives an overall worth of 228.
; 
; The image reminds me of a fancy Christmas tree ornament, so I 
; named it "Seasonal Ornament."  The way to see the ornament is to 
; run the included parameter file or to download the finished GIF 
; image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy clouds and occasional sprinkles here at Fractal Central on 
; Saturday kept the fractal cats indoors.  The temperature of 59F 
; 15C was mild enough, but the cats prefer their paws and whiskers 
; dry when they explore the yard.  Their day ended with a treat of 
; tuna.  Today is starting cloudy and damp, but a clearing is on 
; the way.  (according to the experts)  I hope it arrives in time 
; to give the duo an hour or two of outdoor comfort.
; 
; With little to do but TV and fractals, my day promises to be 
; good enough.  Check back here tomorrow for the next FOTD.  Until 
; then, take care, and fractals don't have a ghost of a chance if 
; there is no screen.
