; FOTD -- November 22, 2004 (Rating NA)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Quantum mechanics has become quite trendy as of late.  Those 
; with only a layman's idea of what it is about (I am in that 
; group) have given it almost a miraculous meaning.  I doubt some 
; way-out ideas such as the quantum world being the place where 
; disembodied souls go after death, but one thing seems certain -- 
; that in the quantum world that lies underneath the intuitive 
; everyday world revealed by our senses, things are far different 
; than they are up here.  My own view is that a structure shares 
; much of the nature of its building blocks, and therefore the 
; objective world of material objects and energies, which is com-
; posed of quantum stuff, is not as real as it appears.  This im-
; plies that, by comparison, the subjective world of thoughts and 
; visions is not as unreal as it appears.  My view is not scienti-
; fic -- it is not supposed to be.  It is verging on mystical.
; 
; I mention all this because I have named today's image "Quantae", 
; which I have decided is the plural of 'quantum'.  I gave it this 
; name because today's marksmandel formula does nothing more than 
; multiply the Mandelbrot set, and today's image is one that could 
; have been found more simply and quickly with the mandel formula.
; 
; To make things as interesting as possible, I set the extra para-
; meter to the integer 32767, which is as high as it can be set 
; without the formula defaulting back to 1.  The parent fractal 
; appears as a simple blue ring.  (This ring seems suspicious.  It 
; is most likely an artifact of the math routine.)  Around the in-
; terior of the ring lie 32767 identical lobes, each one contain-
; ing all the detail of the Mandelbrot set.  I chose to explore a 
; lobe centered on the negative real axis.
; 
; Since I found nothing new in my adventures, I could not give the 
; image a rating.  It will be forever unrated, a misplaced bit of 
; a spurious Mandelbrot set that does not really exist.  Fortu-
; nately, the unrated image renders in almost exactly one minute.  
; With no rating, it has no absolute worth.
; 
; The quantae may be seen by running the parameter file or by down-
; loading the completed GIF image from the FOTD web site at:

; 
; Sunday remained cloudy here at Fractal Central, but with a temp-
; erature of 63F 17C it was mild enough for the dynamic duo to 
; enjoy the afternoon in the holly thicket at the bottom of the 
; yard.  I checked their whereabouts every half hour or so, and no 
; unusual activity was ever apparent, so I assume they had a peace-
; ful afternoon.  Only a small treat was needed in the evening to 
; bring their good day to a satisfying close.  Today is starting 
; cloudy again, but in contrast to Sunday, rain is predicted.  We 
; will see how the duo makes out.
; 
; My work is light enough for me to finish early this afternoon, 
; so it looks like a satisfying day for me also.  Until tomorrow, 
; when the next FOTD appears, take care, and watch your quantum 
; number.
