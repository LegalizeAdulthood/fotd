; FOTD -- November 26, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we return to the 'phoenix' formula, this time 
; to the Julia version.  I will not try to describe in words how 
; this complex formula works, but the full details can be seen by 
; striking the 'Z' key when the image is on the screen.
; 
; Today's image pictures the whole parent fractal, the only change 
; being that I rotated it -90 degrees.  I gave the image its name 
; "Hourglass" when it was perpendicular to its present orientation 
; and actually resembled an upright hourglass.  As it now stands, 
; the hourglass has tipped onto its side.
; 
; To add a bit of interest to the image I departed from my usual 
; outside=iter inside=0 routine and set the outside to 'real' and 
; the inside to 'bof61'.  The areas of chaotic detail are 
; 'outside'; the hourglass shape itself is 'inside.  I must have 
; done something right, for this resulting fractal rates a 7.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is perhaps slightly flattering, but I did put 
; a bit of extra work into the coloring, and I feel the rating is 
; earned.  Despite the complexity of the formula, the image is a 
; very fast one, rendering in only 1-1/4 minutes.  Combined with 
; the rating of 7, this speed gives an overall worth of 529.
; 
; This entire confusion of render time, rating, and overall worth 
; can be avoided by downloading the pre-rendered image from the 
; FOTD web site at:

; 
; With a temperature of 57F 14C, Thursday was mild enough here at 
; Fractal Central, and the showers ended before noon, but the wind 
; blew a gale all afternoon, making the fractal cats too skittish 
; to stay out longer than 15 minutes.  They spent most of the 
; afternoon on the shelf by the window, watching the dried leaves 
; blowing around, turning away from the window only occasionally 
; to wash each other behind the ears.  Surprisingly, they asked 
; for only a small treat of tuna before bedtime.  Today is start-
; ing sunny, but it is freezing cold.  I guess the cats will have 
; very clean ears by the time the day ends.
; 
; I don't know what I'm going to do for the rest of the day -- I 
; am simply not accustomed to days with totally free time.  But I 
; might need a lot of that free time; the next formula in line is 
; a killer.  To see what kind of fractal results, check back in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and get in the big time with the 
; big-time fractalists.
