; FOTD -- November 19, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we move on to the manzpower formula, one of my favorites.  
; I have done so much exploring in this formula (and formulas I 
; have written myself that do the same thing) that I already know 
; where the goodies are likely to be found.
; 
; For today's fractal I calculated the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid.  
; This fractal looks quite like the classic Mandelbrot set except 
; along the negative stem, which is broken apart into infinitely 
; divided sub-stems.  I chose to explore the area immediately east 
; of the large midget on the stem, an area where the break-up is 
; particularly interesting.  After only a few minutes, I tracked 
; down today's scene, which lies on one of the fractured stems.
; 
; The tiny midget at the center is surrounded by one of the most 
; unexpected patterns in all of fractaldom.  To emphasize the 
; unusual pattern, I gave the image a very strong color palette, 
; perhaps going a bit beyond the most pleasing point of color 
; intensity.
; 
; When the time to name the picture arrived, I had a bit of 
; trouble thinking of a fitting name for such a scene.  Then I 
; glanced at the cover of the December issue of 'Scientific 
; American' magazine, which had just arrived in the mail and was 
; lying on the table beside the fractal desk.  On the cover is a 
; picture of a virus, illustrating the inside article 'Are Viruses 
; Alive?'.  The virus looks quite like a 3-D fractal, with its 
; feelers reaching out, ready to latch onto and burrow into any 
; susceptible cell it happens upon.  Then I glanced back at the 
; screen, and saw the same feelers surrounding the midget in the 
; image I had just finished.  It was total synchronicity.  I 
; immediately named the image "Retro-Virus", one of the varieties 
; of viruses.
; 
; I was ready to give the image a rating of 8, but then I remem-
; bered how many times I had been here before, and how I found the 
; scene with almost no effort.  I settled on a rating of 7.  A 
; rating of 7 is above average however, and at under 6 minutes, 
; the render time is within reason.  The render time combines with 
; the rating of 7 to give an overall worth of 123.
; 
; When I finished the fractal, I read the magazine article.  I was 
; not surprised when the article said that whether or not viruses 
; can be considered alive depends on one's definition of the word 
; 'life'.  (The writer must be a politician.)
; 
; One thing not under dispute is that the completed GIF image of 
; today's fractal will soon be available on the FOTD web site.  
; The URL is:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The clouds cleared away by noon on Thursday here at Fractal 
; Central, leading to a sunny and warm afternoon with a 
; temperature of 66F 19C.  The cats had another excellent day in 
; the yard, watching the birds and squirrels.  No special treat 
; was needed to end their day happily.  Today is starting cloudy 
; and mild.  If the sun breaks through, it could be a repeat.
; 
; In my department, the unexpected rush job has been cleared away, 
; with only a small bit of fine-tuning to do before returning to 
; the world of fractals.  Whatever I find there will appear as 
; tomorrow's FOTD.  Until then, take care, and viruses may or may 
; not be alive, but what about fractals?  Are they alive?
