; FOTD -- November 16, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we see what we can wring from the manlam(fn||fn) formula, 
; a variation of the Mandelbrot formula that was proposed by 
; Jonathan Osuch.  In the formula, the magnitude of the current 
; orbit value is used to switch between two different variable 
; functions.  (In C programming language the '||' is the logical 
; 'or'.)  Curiously, I have never counted the number of different 
; functions available in Fractint, though my guess would be around 
; 20, which would give this formula the ability to draw around 400 
; different fractals.
; 
; As would be expected, some combinations of functions draw blank 
; screens, while other combinations draw very interesting 
; fractals.  With a total of around 400 combinations to try, I was 
; forced to let many go untried.  I finally chose the cos/sqr 
; combination, which draws two distorted Mandelbrot sets sitting 
; butt to butt.  Raising the shift value to an astronomical 
; 1000000 revealed that these Mandeloids are surrounded by an 
; extraordinary array of filaments, which with only a little 
; imagination can be seen as herring-bones.  I named the final 
; image "Something is Fishy" because the filaments surrounding the 
; central midget remind me of fish skeletons.
; 
; The formula almost certainly has better fractals in it than I 
; was able to find in only an hour.  The rating of a 5 is my way 
; of saying that today's image is nothing exceptional among the 
; images that the formula might produce.
; 
; Like a witch's broom, today's image is as fast as lightning.  It 
; renders in only 21 seconds, and this with the single-pass 
; rendering option, which is the slowest, most accurate method of 
; rendering.  This hyper-speed gives the image an unjustified 
; overall worth of 1394.
; 
; The fun way to see the image is to run the included parameter 
; file.  The convenient way is to download it from the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The fractal cats were quite happy when the sun shone brilliantly 
; and the temperature rose to 61F 16C here at Fractal Central on 
; Monday.  They spent over three hours in the yard, doing next to 
; nothing.  When evening arrived, they came inside without a 
; complaint.  BTW, fractal cats are indistinguishable from 
; ordinary every-day non-fractal cats.  The only difference is 
; that the pet humans of fractal cats are fascinated by fractals.  
; Today promises to be warm again, but with perhaps a bit less 
; sun.  The cats should be happy again.  The commercial work is 
; still up to date, so I'll be happy too.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours at this same place.  Until 
; then, take care, and count those fractal carbs.
