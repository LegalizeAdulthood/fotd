; FOTD -- November 28, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Advancing through the Fractint formulas, I checked the 'popcorn' 
; formula and skipped over it because it appears to draw orbits.  
; The present tour of the program is limited to the escape-time 
; formulas.  But then, for some reason, I decided to check the 
; 'popcornjul' formula, and much to my surprise found that it does 
; indeed draw what appears to be escape-time images -- and an over-
; whelming variety of them at that.
; 
; With four functions and four variable parameters to adjust, and 
; only an hour or so in which to do the adjusting, I was able to 
; only scratch the surface of what this formula might do.  I tried 
; using the evolver on the formula, and found that it gave such a 
; huge variety of images with so little relation to each other that 
; it was of little help in finding the best that the formula has in 
; it.  In the end I settled on the parameters and functions used in 
; today's image.
; 
; I named the image "The Great Mystery".  Studying the picture, I 
; had the impression that it hints at monumental things, but what 
; those things might be remains a mystery.  It could be an edge-on 
; view of the planet Saturn as seen from the upper atmosphere of 
; its large moon Titan.  But if so, the ringed planet is in the 
; process of melting.  It could be someone's idea of an atom of 
; uranium floating in some multi-dimensional theoretical space.  
; But atoms are not objects that can be pictured as we picture the 
; things in the world around us.  It could even be something not 
; yet scientifically proven, which is presently considered para-
; normal.  Whatever it is remains and always will remain a mystery, 
; and this is why I gave the image its name.
; 
; I rated the image at a 7, mostly because I enjoy mysteries.  And 
; one thing not very mysterious is the render time, which is a 
; zippy 15 seconds.  When combined, the rating and render time 
; give the image an overall worth of a grossly exaggerated 2726.
; 
; For those who would rather not render, the GIF image is avail-
; able on the WWW at the URL:

; 
; With a mixture of sun and clouds, and a temperature of 52F 11C, 
; Saturday was comfortable enough for the fractal cats to enjoy 
; nearly 2 hours in the yard.  When they came in, only a small 
; treat of tuna was necessary.  This morning is starting cold, and 
; wet from overnight rain.  The rain has ended however.  I hope it 
; dries out fast enough for the cats to enjoy a reasonable time in 
; the yard.
; 
; I have every intention of having the fourth day in a row with 
; nothing to do but take it easy.  If this keeps up, I might even 
; start to enjoy it.  The next fractal will appear on schedule in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be a ray of sunshine on a 
; cloudy day.
