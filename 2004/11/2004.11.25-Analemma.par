; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the next formula in line, the 'newton' 
; formula, which works the same as the 'newtbasin' formula except 
; that it colors the images according to the number of iterations 
; it takes for the iterated points to reach their roots.
; 
; For some arbitrary reason, I named the image "Analemma".  An 
; analemma is the figure-8 graph usually seen in the Pacific Ocean 
; areas of world globes.  At a single glance it shows the sun's 
; declination and the equation of time for each day of the year.  
; But there is little in today's image that resembles an analemma. 
; The word simply seemed to fit the mood of the moment when I 
; thought of it.
; 
; The image itself resembles a solar eclipse more than anything 
; else.  Or some might see a steering wheel at the center.  It is 
; an unusual picture when compared to my standard routine of an 
; unending string of images with decorated Mandelbrot midgets at 
; the center.  But since starting the tour of the Fractint 
; formulas, I have done many images with no midgets, so maybe 
; today's image is not so unusual after all.
; 
; I created the picture by setting the single parameter to a 
; rather high value of 240 and rendering the scene with the 
; outside set to 'mult'.  Apparently just for the fun of it, the 
; 'mult' option colors the pixels by multiplying the iteration 
; count of escaping points by their real divided by maginary 
; values at the time they escape.
; 
; The render time on my ancient worn-out machine is a nominal 
; 12-3/4 minutes.  This joins with the rating of 7 to give an 
; overall worth of 55.  For those who do not render, the image is 
; available for download on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Those who download from the web site can ignore the overall 
; worth.
; 
; An off-and-on light rain fell all day Wednesday here at Fractal 
; Central.  The rain did not amount to much, but it was enough to 
; keep things wet and keep the fractal cats confined indoors.  
; Luckily we were well stocked with tuna.  Today is starting 
; partly cloudy and quite mild, but showers are in the area, and 
; the wind is rising.  The cats have yet to pass judgement on the 
; conditions.
; 
; In my department the work is caught up and I have little to do 
; for the rest of the day but take it easy.  So far I have heard 
; nothing about being invited to any dinners.  Unless something 
; changes, this will leave me plenty of time to find the next 
; fractal.  Until that next fractal appears, which will happen 
; right here in 24 hours, take care, and then take further care.
