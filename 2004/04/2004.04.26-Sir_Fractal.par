; FOTD -- April 26, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in an immense parent fractal that is too 
; large to display in its entirety, and in fact might be infinite 
; in its large as well as its small aspect.  This huge parent was 
; created by combining Z^(-1.25) with 0.24 as much Z^(-5.21) and 
; adding (1/C).  The location of today's scene at -11519.6 on the 
; X-axis and -6756.86 on the Y-axis shows that we have wandered 
; far from the familiar home grounds around the origin of the 
; parent, into the dark mysterious outer reaches of Fractal Land, 
; beyond which lies the unknown.
; 
; Even way out here, we find the same scattering of midget copies 
; of the Mandelbrot set.  Apparently, Fractal Land is like the 
; Physical Universe -- the general laws are the same in all its 
; parts, no matter how distant those parts might be.  This does 
; not mean that the laws of Fractal Land are the same as the laws 
; of the universe.  There is no cosmic speed limit that corre-
; sponds to the velocity of light -- at least none that I am aware 
; of.  But there does appear to be something similar to gravity, 
; which appears when two midgets approach to within a certain 
; distance, and can be visibly seen stretching toward each other.
; 
; Fractal Land is eternal.  It does not change with time unless we 
; ourselves make a series of separate images and join them into a 
; single animation.  But even here, it is we who have created the 
; illusion of motion by joining in our minds a series of separate 
; images into a single moving object.  The situation is similar 
; with the physical universe.  We are told that there exists in 
; physical reality a shortest possible length of time known as the 
; Planck time, which is 10^-43 of a second.  If this is true, then 
; all the motion we think we see around us is an illusion of our 
; own creation.  Nothing is moving, we are merely observing a 
; sequential series of eternally frozen three-dimensional 
; universes and merging them in our minds into a single dynamic 
; three-dimensional universe that changes in a time that we 
; ourselves are creating.
; 
; Our intellect has reached a stage where we are beginning to 
; recognize the illusory nature of what we have long taken as the 
; one external reality.  Objective and subjective are no longer 
; absolute.  It appears that once we develop the long-sought-for 
; 'theory of everything', the question will then become 'what is 
; having the illusion?'  And I would not be at all surprised if 
; we were to discover that the universe, and ourselves as well, 
; are merely intricately detailed fractals.
; 
; Well, I appear to have gotten distracted from the business at 
; hand, which is the FOTD.  I have named the image "Sir Fractal" 
; because in my opinion it has a certain solidness about it -- a 
; nobility that would be expected of knights.  I rated the image 
; at a 7.  This is an improvement over the recent images, which 
; have not been the greatest.  Combined with the render time of 
; 6-1/2 minutes, the overall value rates a 107.
; 
; Those who lack the time to render the image from the included 
; parameter file may download the completed image from the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Sunday remained cloudy and chilly here at Fractal Central, with 
; a temperature that never rose above 64F 18C.  Luckily the rain 
; held off and the cats had a pleasant but slightly cool afternoon 
; in the yard.  But this morning is proving damp and foggy, with 
; occasional light rain.  It remains to be seen how the dynamic 
; duo will react.
; 
; What I'm going to do is the work that needs to be done.  And 
; when I finish, I'll take a trip to Fractal Land to worry about 
; that great illusion.  What I find there will appear as the next 
; FOTD.  So until tomorrow, take care, and see you soon.
