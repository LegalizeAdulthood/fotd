; FOTD -- April 27, 2004 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we return to the image quality that makes 
; fractals worth the effort.  The rating of an 8 is the highest 
; in some time.  Hopefully, this is a sign of things to come.
; 
; To create the parent fractal, I mixed together Z^(-1.77) and 
; Z^(-7.71), added (1/C) and let the mixture iterate for 1200 
; cycles.  The resulting fractal is beyond description, an 
; oversized thing consisting of numerous bays, valleys, long 
; looping filaments, scattered bits and pieces, a curious almost-
; midget, as well as assorted other items of interest.
; 
; The east side of the main bay is decorated with a prominent 
; valley, which at first glance might be taken to be an East 
; Valley.  From the center of this valley extends a zig-zag 
; filament strung with dewdrop-like nodes.  Today's scene lies 
; rather deep in one of these nodes.  Surprisingly, the area has 
; almost none of the typical 'East Valley' features.
; 
; The standard equal-iteration-band rendering gives a good-enough 
; image, but the evaporated version of the scene is better.  It is 
; this evaporated version that I used as today's FOTD.  I made the 
; totally-inside material visible by using the bof61 inside fill.  
; Other fills might work equally well, but I have not yet tried 
; any of them.
; 
; When searching for a name, I noticed the hyperbolic elements and 
; named the image "Iterative Hyperbolae".  When figured into the 
; 6-minute render time, the rating of an 8 gives an overall value 
; of 135.  What the overall value might be when the image is 
; downloaded is up to the individual to decide.
; 
; The download is available at:

; 
; Rain fell all day here at Fractal Central on Monday, while the 
; temperature reached only 59F 15C.  The cats did not approve and 
; showed their disapproval by flipping into their sulking modes.  
; A treat of tuna in the evening helped a bit, but a dish of fish 
; cannot make up for a missed afternoon in the yard.  Today looks 
; somewhat better, so we'll see how it goes.
; 
; For me it's a day of work before fun.  Until next FOTD fractal, 
; take care, and be at ease.
