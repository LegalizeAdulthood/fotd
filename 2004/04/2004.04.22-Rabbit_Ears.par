; FOTD -- April 22, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To create the parent fractal of today's image, I took Z^(-1.6) 
; and added 0.26 part of Z^(-6.1) to it before adding (1/C).  The 
; MandelbrotMix4 formula mixed these ingredients thoroughly.
; 
; The 1200 iterations produced a fractal that retains many of the 
; characteristics of the Z^(-1.6) and Z^(-6.1) Mandeloids, yet at 
; the same time is something entirely new, with many features of 
; the Z^2+C Mandelbrot set, such as bays, buds, valleys and 
; midgets.  Today's scene lies in one of the many valleys of this 
; parent.
; 
; The escape radius of the classic Z^2+C Mandelbrot set may be 
; increased to as large a number as can be entered as a parameter, 
; and the result will be nothing more than an outward shifting of 
; the iteration bands.  But when the escape radius of a fractal 
; such as today's parent is increased, the image quickly falls 
; apart.  By the time the escape radius reaches one-googol, 
; nothing is left but empty space.  All the points have become 
; trapped.  I call this process 'evaporation'.
; 
; Things are not lost however.  All the points might be trapped, 
; but they are still active, and the results of this activity can 
; be made visible by rendering the image with the inside option 
; set to something like 'bof61', which I believe colors the points 
; according to which iteration takes them closest to the origin.
; 
; All this stuff is relevant because the escape radius of today's 
; image is indeed one-googol, and all the points have therefore 
; been trapped.  The original scene has evaporated.  What we see 
; on the screen are the things that the trapped points are doing 
; in their confinement, made visible by the dynamic 'bof61' inside 
; fill.
; 
; What I see while staring at the image is a forest of rabbit 
; ears.  Maybe this means the residents of Fractal Land have 
; over-the-air TV, but more likely it's just a coincidence.  
; Whatever the reason, I named the image "Rabbit Ears", then 
; rated it at a 6, which gives an overall value of a 66.
; 
; Don't waste time investigating the detail inside the rabbit 
; ears.  This detail consists of moire patterns -- artificial 
; patterns caused by limited screen resolution, which vanish 
; faster than one can go after them.
; 
; The only thing faster than a vanishing moire pattern is the 
; download of today's pre-rendered GIF image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; On Wednesday the temperature reached 73F 23C here at Fractal 
; Central, while the sun shone frequently and the wind blew gently 
; from the east.  The cats enjoy such conditions, and made no 
; exceptions on Wednesday, when they spent half of the morning and 
; the entire afternoon lounging in the yard.  Today is similar.  
; The cats are already on their window shelves, gazing at the sun 
; and planning a lazy afternoon.
; 
; For me, it will be another in a seemingly endless string of days 
; with work before play.  The next fractal will hatch when the 
; work is finished.  Until next time, take care, and be back in 24 
; hours for the next fractal.
