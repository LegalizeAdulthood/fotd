; FOTD -- April 09, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When you run today's parameter file, do not be concerned when 
; the first line appears, then nothing more seems to happen.  This 
; is normal.  I have used the passes=t option with today's image, 
; and the bottom line, which draws next, is very slow and mostly 
; black.  After a minute or so, the image will continue developing 
; normally.
; 
; Today is the Good Friday semi-holiday here at Fractal Central, 
; but from the amount of work lying before me, one would never 
; guess it.  Once again, I find myself giving short shrift to the 
; fractal side of life.
; 
; Today's image shows a lively little Mandelbrot midget located in 
; the parent fractal that results when 1.8 parts of Z^(-1.2) are 
; subtracted from Z^(-1.8) and (1/C) is added.  I named the image 
; "Jet Blast" because of the curious string of trapped points that 
; appears to be blasting from the East Valley of the midget.  A 
; few other names came to mind, which are best left un-mentioned.
; 
; In addition to our large midget, the scene is filled with other 
; midgets, most of which lack the typical organized 2,4,8... 
; pattern of elements surrounding them.  When an area grows 
; chaotic, the regular pattern breaks down.  This is true even in 
; the classic Mandelbrot set.
; 
; Since I basically used the first object I found as today's FOTD, 
; I could rate the image no higher than a 4.  The slow render time 
; of 32-1/2 minutes results in an overall value of 12.  Those who 
; think it worth the effort will run the parameter file included 
; at the bottom of this letter.  Others will save time by viewing 
; the finished GIF image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Cool temperatures in the low 50's (around 11C), thick clouds, 
; chilly winds, and occasional sprinkles on Thursday kept the 
; fractal cats confined to the porch, where they were somewhat 
; sheltered from the unpleasant conditions.  Tippy ventured down 
; into the wet grass once or twice, but retreated to the porch 
; when he felt the wetness.  Thomas merely slept in his porch 
; chair.  The good news is that today is starting sunny.  Perhaps 
; the duo will have a good day.
; 
; My day will be quite busy, especially for a day that is supposed 
; to be a holiday.  Until next FOTD, take care, and if the U.S.A. 
; really does keep church and state separate, why are so many 
; people on a holiday today?
