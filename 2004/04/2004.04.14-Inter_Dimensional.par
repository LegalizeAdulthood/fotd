; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Fractals are said to be things with a fractional dimension.  
; This concept is as hard to visualize as things with four 
; dimensions, but I think I have a vague idea of fractional 
; dimensions.  The way I visualize an object or a space with, 
; say, 2-1/2 dimensions is to picture something that extends 
; indefinitely in two dimensions but has limited freedom to extend 
; in the third dimension -- kind of like a lumpy plane.  Of 
; course, fractional dimensions are not supposed to be real 
; things.  Like the many interpretations of quantum mechanics, 
; they are mathematical concepts which happen to work rather well.
; 
; There is no uncertainty of the number of dimensions of today's 
; image however.  It most certainly has two dimensions.  If it did 
; not, it could not fill the monitor screen, and could not be 
; printed on the surface of a sheet of paper.
; 
; The scene is located in the fractal that results when 4.5 
; negative parts of Z^3 are combined with 3.375 negative parts of 
; Z^4 and 1/C is added.  This parent fractal consists of a main 
; Mandeloid surrounded by numerous large holes, which act as the 
; terminals of filaments.  Today's image is located very near the 
; point where a filament of a sub-bud of the main bud of the 
; parent Mandeloid terminates in a hole.
; 
; A good part of the image consists of empty holes, which have 
; been brought to life by the 'bof61' inside fill.  All this 
; dimensional stuff inspired the name "Inter-Dimensional".  I 
; originally had rated the image at a 6, but then I happened to 
; view it from across the room, and noticed that it looks as good 
; at a distance as it does close-up.  I raised the rating to a 7, 
; which, when the render time of 7-1/2 minutes is considered, 
; gives an overall value of 93.
; 
; The most efficient way of viewing the image is to download it 
; from Paul's FOTD web site at:

; 
; The clouds hung tough all day Tuesday here at Fractal Central, 
; while the rain fell in sudden short showers.  Combined with a 
; temperature of 48F 9C, these conditions proved too rigorous for 
; the dynamic duo, who spent the afternoon on their shelf by the 
; window, watching the birds and taking turns washing each other.  
; In the evening, a generous treat of mackerel helped improve 
; their moods.  Today is starting like Tuesday did -- with clouds 
; and light rain.  I expect similar things from the duo.
; 
; For me, it's work until it's finished.  That should take around 
; 5 hours, then it will be time for the daily trip to Fractaltown. 
; In 24 hours, I'll report what I find there.  Until then, take 
; care, and who could possibly solve the mystery of fractals?
