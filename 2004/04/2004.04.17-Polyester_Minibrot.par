; FOTD -- April 17, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Once again the time has come to enter Fractal Land, that strange 
; land that exists somewhere between the real world around us, 
; which might not be totally real, and the imaginary worlds within 
; us, which might not be totally unreal.
; 
; The irregular real(p3) parameter of today's image shows that its 
; parent fractal was found by the Fractint 'evolver' feature.  
; Normally, I round off the odd numbers this feature produces, but 
; for some reason I skipped the rounding process when I started 
; working with today's parent.
; 
; The parent fractal is a hugely bloated area of mostly disconnec-
; ted rings.  Today's scene is located near a larger midget that 
; lies in the interior of a ring in the distant north-northeast 
; suburbs of the parent.
; 
; The unusual detail inside the midget itself is a sign that the 
; scene has been evaporated, and the ghost brought to life by the 
; bof61 inside fill.  Fractals in which all the exponents of Z are 
; negative can be evaporated by raising the escape radius to a 
; full googol, which is the amount entered as the imag(p3) para-
; meter of today's image.  This trick usually traps every point.
; 
; For reasons known only to myself and the 'intelligent designer', 
; (whatever you consider this to be), I named the image "Polyester 
; Minibrot".  I might have done myself a favor when I rated it at 
; a 7, but the image is really rather pleasant to look at, and I 
; feel it earns its rating.  The reasonably fast render time of 
; under 4 minutes gives an overall value of 184.
; 
; The render time is fast, but the fastest way of all to enjoy the 
; image is to download it in finished form from the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a temperature of 67F 19C, gentle breezes, and warm sunshine 
; to keep them happy, the fractal cats put on their best moods 
; Friday.  When the day was finished, they were so exhausted that 
; they forgot their customary evening treats, and went right to 
; sleep.  Today is starting mostly sunny and warmer.  I expect a 
; similar day.
; 
; For me, most of the graphics work is caught up.  If I can muster 
; the energy this afternoon, I'll give the grass the first 
; trimming of the season.  If not, I'll do it tomorrow or Monday.  
; Until next time, take care, and don't get hot under the collar 
; when a cool fractal appears.
