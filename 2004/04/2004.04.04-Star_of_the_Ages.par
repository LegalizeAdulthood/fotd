; FOTD -- April 04, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the land created when 0.2 parts of Z^3 
; are subtracted from Z^2, where we further study the possibili-
; ties of the 'fmod' option.  We also make use of the 'bof61' 
; inside coloring option, which is effective because a good part 
; of the image consists of areas of trapped 'inside' points.
; 
; Yes, I do feel a bit guilty about the departure from fractal 
; reality that took place when I decided to use these two options 
; rather than outside=iter, inside=0, but the image is not bad, in 
; fact it rates a 7, and is worth its moment in the sun as FOTD 
; for April 4.
; 
; I saw a letter on the fractint list recently wondering whether 
; formulas other than Z^2+C will produce undistorted Mandelbrot 
; sets.  I would say the answer is yes.  I have been producing 
; them for years with the MandelbrotMix series of formulae.  A 
; formula as simple as Z^2+Z+C will merely shift the M-set around, 
; while leaving it otherwise unchanged.
; 
; Curiously, when Z is added to any power of Z other than 2, an 
; entirely new fractal will result.  See what happens when the 
; formula Z^(2.5)+Z+C is calculated.  And the formula Z^2+2Z+C has 
; no effect whatsoever, producing a Mandelbrot set that is both 
; undistorted and in its proper position as well.
; 
; When searching for a name for today's image, I was struck by the 
; eight-pointed star, and thought of the name "Star of the Ages".  
; The name has a kind of religious sound to it, but no connection 
; to religion was intended.
; 
; When combined with the render time of over 5 minutes, today's 
; image has an overall value of 131.  For convenience, the 
; completed GIF image will soon be posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Though the weather was improved here at Fractal central on 
; Saturday, it was still too wet and chilly (50F 10C) for the cats 
; to remain in the yard longer than 30 minutes.  They spent the 
; remaining 23-1/2 hours sleeping.  The problem this morning is 
; more rain, colder temperatures, and high winds, so I doubt that 
; the day will be any better.
; 
; For me, it might be an afternoon of 'antiquing' as the fractal 
; lady calls examining the junk that others have thrown away.  
; When the crisis has passed, I'll return to fractal land.  Until 
; tomorrow, take care, and I have yet to see a discarded fractal 
; in one of those antique shops.
