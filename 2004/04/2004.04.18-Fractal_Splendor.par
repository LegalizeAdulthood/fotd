; FOTD -- April 18, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Take (1/Z), mix it with 1/2 as much Z^(-2), and add (1/C).  What 
; do you get?  Why, a fractal of course -- an oversized fractal 
; that is too large to fit on the default screen and needs to be 
; shrunk by an outzoom before it becomes completely visible.  This 
; fractal has X-axis symmetry, but only because the exponents of Z 
; are whole numbers.  Changing (1/Z) to Z^(-1.1) or Z^(-2) to 
; Z^(-2.1) gives a pair of entirely new fractals with no symmetry.
; 
; This parent fractal is far richer in detail that the classic 
; Mandelbrot set.  The detail might not be any more varied, but it 
; covers a far larger area.  The fractal has an interesting area 
; around +7 on the real axis, where two graceful arcs of delicate 
; filaments come together.  Today's scene is located in one of 
; these arcs, very near the point where it touches the X-axis.
; 
; I have colored the image to resemble something like a brilliant 
; star blazing away in empty space, and named it "Fractal 
; Splendor".  I seem to remember a somewhat similar FOTD image 
; from several years past, but if today's image is a near-repeat, 
; I will consider it simply a variation on a splendid theme.
; 
; I rated today's image at a 7, mostly because of the extra effort 
; I put into the coloring.  The render time of 11 minutes gives 
; the image an overall value of 59.  As always, the image may be 
; seen most conveniently by downloading it from the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Saturday was as close to being a perfect day as we have come in 
; quite a few months here at Fractal Central.  Warm sun, light 
; winds and a temperature of 84F 29C gave the fractal cats all 
; they could ask for.  If they had been 10 years younger, they 
; would have romped all afternoon.  But being 14-year-old cats, 
; they slept in the shade of the holly trees most all afternoon, 
; and romped, (if what they did can be called romping), only a few 
; minutes.  Today is starting just like yesterday.  I assume the 
; cats will have an equal day.
; 
; As for me, I'll put off the grass trimming one more day, and 
; take it easy.  The work is light and I should have lots of time 
; to get it done on Monday.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and try to prove that fractals 
; are not real without defining reality.
