; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us into the fourth dimension.  I have always 
; been fascinated by the fourth dimension.  I was not yet a 
; teen-ager when, having just finished a book, (I think its name 
; was "One, Two, Three, Infinity..."), I asked my father where the 
; fourth dimension is, and, thinking of relativity, he told me 
; that it is in the past and the future.  This was not a very 
; satisfactory answer.  The past and future are time, not space.  
; I wanted to know where the fourth dimension of space is.  He 
; then explained to me that as far as we know, there is no fourth 
; spatial dimension, and even if there were, we would perceive it 
; in three-dimensional terms.
; 
; This is the problem.  We are brain-washed to perceive our 
; surroundings as a three-dimensional world.  We have not been 
; wired to perceive a four-dimensional space, and it is too late 
; to change that.  If we were suddenly dropped into a four-
; dimensional world, we would not see the fourth dimension.  We 
; would see a three-dimensional world that obeyed different rules. 
; Solid objects would change shape as we watched; objects would 
; appear and vanish.  We would think the world had gone crazy.  We 
; would probably go crazy ourselves, (as some say I already have), 
; but we would be no closer to visualizing the fourth dimension.
; 
; Even now, we are able to fully visualize and understand the 
; shadows that would be cast by four-dimensional objects onto the 
; three-dimensional surface of our space.  A 4-D hypersphere would 
; cast a spherical shadow if the ray of light fell perpendicularly 
; onto our space.  If the light struck our space at an angle, we 
; would see an oblate spheroid, the eccentricity of which would 
; vary with the angle of the ray of light.  But even though we 
; understand all of this, we are still totally unable to visualize 
; the hypersphere that would be casting the shadow.
; 
; We can also know and fully visualize the three-dimensional 
; slices of four-dimensional objects.  The 4-D hypercube may be 
; sliced to give many curious prisms, as well as a tetrahedron and 
; an octahedron, and of course the expected cube.  But even this 
; is of no help in our quest to realize the fourth dimension.
; 
; Our lack of visualizing ability is curious.  We can program our 
; computers to 'think' in four dimensions almost as easily as in 
; three.  We could even give them three-dimensional screens on 
; which to better display the 4-D worlds they would have no 
; trouble in manipulating.  Of course, we would then be unable to 
; view the 3-D screens in the proper manner, from outside our 
; space.  We would of necessity need to view the screens 
; 'edge-on'.  We appear to be forever doomed, trapped in a world 
; of three dimensions, while able to know of the far greater 
; vistas that would lie before us if only we could rewire our 
; minds.
; 
; Since our minds are not about to be rewired, it's best we turn 
; to today's image.
; 
; Today's image is a two-dimensional slice of a four-dimensional 
; object.  In this case, the object is the 4-D Julibrot created by 
; iterating the formula (1/Z)-Z+C.  I have sliced the Julibrot in 
; what I call the Oblate direction, which is determined by the 
; imaginary C and real Z axes.
; 
; The picture has a certain surreal quality about it, which 
; inspired the above outburst about higher dimensions.  It could 
; almost be something we might see if we were suddenly dropped 
; into a four-dimensional space.  This is why I named the picture 
; "Land of Fractals".
; 
; Since the image is such a departure from my usual fractal fare, 
; I was not sure how to rate it.  I finally decided on a rating of 
; an average 5.  The short render time of 2-1/2 minutes raises the 
; overall value to a mighty 202.
; 
; An alternate way of seeing the other-worldly scene is to 
; download it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Light rain fell steadily all day Wednesday here at Fractal 
; Central, keeping the fractal duo confined to the indoors.  Even 
; if it had not been raining, the temperature of 50F 10C would 
; have been a bit chilly for their sensitive ears.  Today is 
; starting windy and chilly, but sunny.  We'll see how the 
; dynamic fractal cats take these conditions.
; 
; For me it's work before play.  The problem comes in separating 
; the two.  Until tomorrow's FOTD, take care, and most likely it's 
; fractals all the way down.
