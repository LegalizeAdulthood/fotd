; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a view of a sub-midget that lies in the 'East 
; Valley' area of a larger midget situated near the main bay of 
; the Z^(1.55)+C Mandeloid.  I put the words east valley in quotes 
; because the valley might or might not be an actual East Valley.  
; I consider it an east valley because it appears to be connected 
; to the main body of the parent fractal by a broken series of 
; elements.  The thing that appears in today's image is a close-up 
; of the center of one of these disconnected elements.
; 
; When I saw the completed image, I was immediately reminded of a 
; strange alien sun bursting through storm clouds.  The name 
; "Helios" quickly came to mind.  I rated the image at a 7 because 
; it is rather striking when viewed for the first time.  When the 
; render time of 9-1/3 minutes is figured in, the overall value 
; rates a 75.
; 
; To see the alien sun, run the included parameter file, or let 
; Paul do the work, and download the image from his FOTD web site 
; at:

;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The rain fell steadily all day Thursday here at Fractal Central, 
; with a temperature than never made it above 46F 8C.  The dynamic 
; fractal cats were most dis-satisfied with the conditions, and 
; let their frustration be known by getting into a fight.  The 
; fight started when Thomas tried to take the spot on the couch 
; that Tippy had already settled in.  Thomas received a scratched 
; head; Tippy got a nick on his ear.  When they made up, I treated 
; them to some tuna, and they ended the day peacefully.  Today is 
; starting cloudy and quite cool, with occasional light rain 
; showers.  Hopefully, the duo will get through the day without 
; fighting.
; 
; My work is reasonably light, but even this small amount of work 
; will never be finished unless it is started.  Until next 
; fractal, take care, and watch out for alien fractals invading 
; from outer space.
