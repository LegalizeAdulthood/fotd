; FOTD -- April 23, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's relatively harmless image takes us into the world 
; created by combining portions of Z^(-1.8) and Z^(-8.1), then 
; adding (1/C).  To decide how much Z^(-8.1) to include, I simply 
; divided 1.8 by 8.1.  I doubt that this procedure has any special 
; significance on the appearance of the resulting fractal, but 
; doing it is kind of fun, and above all else, fractals should be 
; fun.
; 
; The image shows a midget (nothing unusual in that) located in a 
; node on a zig-zag filament in a valley of the humdrum parent.  I 
; rendered the scene in the conventional manner (nothing unusual 
; in that either) and named it "Star and a Half".  I can give no 
; good reason for the name other than it sounds poetic.
; 
; Since everything about the image is normal and it takes 5-1/2 
; minutes to render, I rated it at a 5, which is as average as it 
; is possible for a 'Fractal of the Day' to be.  When the render 
; time is taken into consideration, the overall value rates a 91.
; 
; The task of copying this letter into the Fractint directory 
; with a .par extension and running it as a parameter file may be 
; avoided by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the GIF image from there.
; 
; The rain held off Thursday, letting the cats have a pleasant 
; afternoon in the yard.  When the time arrived to come inside for 
; dinner, they did so without complaint, settling to sleep only 5 
; minutes after eating.  Today is starting sunny but oppressive -- 
; the kind of day that produces thunder, which the cats do not 
; enjoy.  We will see how it goes.
; 
; We also will see how the dynamic duo takes to the hordes of 
; 17-year cicadas that are soon to make their appearance in the 
; Fractal Central vicinity.  Their holes are already starting to 
; appear in the ground under the trees.  These bugs come out by 
; the millions every 17 years, doing little harm but making a 
; terrible racket for a month or so.  When they die, their dead 
; bodies literally make eight-inch-deep cicada drifts in the 
; gutters.  When the cicadas last appeared in 1987, Squeaky and 
; Little One, the predecessors of the present dynamic duo were 
; overwhelmed.
; 
; Things will be less overwhelming for me when the work is behind 
; me, but to bring that about will require around 4 hours' effort. 
; Until next time, take care, and fractals are clearly infinite, 
; but unfortunately, people are not.
