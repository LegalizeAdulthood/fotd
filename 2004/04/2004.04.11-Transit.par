; FOTD -- April 11, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Those who react to the mention of spam with symptoms of high 
; anxiety should skip to the second paragraph below.
; 
; Today I think I set a new record in the number of junk e-mails I 
; deleted.  (248 junkers arrived since 11:30pm last evening.)  The 
; junk is easy to recognize, that is no problem, but the mere act 
; of going down the list and deleting it is becoming a major task. 
; Maybe I'll change my familiar 9-year-old e-mail addresses, or 
; maybe I'll simply set up to reject every e-mail that arrives in 
; 'html' format without checking.  If I do this, those serious 
; correspondents who post their e-mail in html format will be out 
; of luck.  If their e-mail program automatically formats their 
; outgoing mail in html format, they will have to change it to 
; plain text.  If not, too bad.  I will not receive their mail.
; 
; But for today I am continuing to delete the junk by hand.  I am 
; also continuing to find ever more fractals with midgets at the 
; center.  Today's image mixes 1/100 part of Z^10 with one part of 
; Z^1.5, and adds 1/C to produce an oversized parent fractal that 
; needs an outzoom to shrink it small enough to fit on the screen. 
; When this is done, a central Mandeloid appears, surrounded by 
; satellite holes of every size and shape, some connected, some 
; disconnected.
; 
; One of the most prominent holes lies at the terminus of the 
; main stem of the Mandeloid, which in this case leads off to the 
; northeast.  A small spiral appears where the stem joins the 
; hole.  Today's scene lies deep in this small spiral.
; 
; When rendered in the conventional outside=iter inside=0 manner, 
; today's scene, which consists of both inside and outside 
; material, is pretty boring.  Most of the other inside and 
; outside options do little better.  But when the inside is set to 
; 'bof61' and the outside is set to 'fmod' with a proximity of 1, 
; the scene really comes to life.
; 
; My original name for the image was 'Night Crawlers', since 
; something in it reminds me of searching for worms.  But then I 
; thought of a rare astronomical event soon to happen -- a transit 
; of Venus -- and named the image "Transit".  I have no reason for 
; choosing the name other than I felt like it.
; 
; It's not really a great image, but it is different enough from 
; my normal style fractal to rate an above-average 7.  And when 
; the not-too-slow render time of 10 minutes is taken into 
; account, the overall value reaches a 68.
; 
; The value may be increased by downloading the completed GIF 
; image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Surprisingly, the rain held off and the clouds broke around noon 
; on Saturday, leading to a mild afternoon, with sun and tempera-
; tures around 63F 17C.  This is not as warm as the fractal cats 
; would have preferred, but they made the best of things and had a 
; pleasant two hours in the yard.  This morning is Easter Sunday, 
; but it is cloudy and cooler, with sprinkles of rain starting 
; already.  I fear the cats' good day will not be repeated.
; 
; Most likely, I'll do little but take it easy for most of the 
; day.  Until next time, take care, and fractals also can rise 
; from the dead.
