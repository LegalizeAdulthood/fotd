; FOTD -- April 12, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we have a fractal where anything goes.  Don't bother 
; looking for a theme -- there is none.  The image jumbles 
; together almost all the elements that appear in fractals, and 
; comes up with a dish with a little bit of everything for 
; everyone.  Unfortunately, a little bit of everything equals a 
; lot of nothing, and an image with a lot of nothing can hardly be 
; considered above average.  I rated the image at an average 5, 
; which, due to the slow render time of 28 minutes, gives an 
; overall value of only 17.
; 
; The parent fractal was created by combining (1/Z) with 0.5 as 
; much Z^(-2) and adding (1/C).  I partially evaporated the 
; fractal by raising the escape radius to 3600.  Today's scene is 
; located on a string of debris that runs down the shredded 
; remains of a valley in the parent fractal.
; 
; The image has a midget Mandelbrot set at the center, as do most 
; of my FOTD images.  But unlike most of the images, this midget 
; is nearly impossible to find.  It is so hard to pick out that I 
; have named the image "Hidden Minibrot".
; 
; Part of the difficulty in finding the midget is because it has 
; almost none of the usual symmetry surrounding it.  The fact that 
; the image is a mixture of inside and outside material, with the 
; inside colored by the 'bof61' option, adds to the difficulty.  
; The difficulty is further increased because the midget is not in 
; the 'normal' position, with the main stem pointing west.  But 
; the midget is there, and can be easily spotted if the image is 
; re-rendered with the inside set to 'inside=0' and the imag(p3) 
; parameter reset to -50.  When this is done, much of the 
; evaporated material re-condenses and the dead-black central 
; midget becomes strikingly obvious.
; 
; The 28 minutes required for the image to render may be avoided 
; by downloading the finished product from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The clouds hung thick all day Sunday here at Fractal Central, 
; while the temperature hovered around 43F 6C and the rain fell 
; lightly at intervals.  All this unpleasantness kept the cat duo 
; confined to the porch for the entire afternoon.  The cats took 
; the poor conditions better than expected.  Most likely, they are 
; getting used to indoor and porch life.  Today is starting 
; cloudy, cool and rainy.  The cats' day will likely be no better.
; 
; After a boring day of doing nothing but watching TV on Sunday, I 
; will be a little busier today.  The true fun will begin when the 
; real work has been completed and I enter Fractal Land.  Tomorrow 
; at this time I will report on what I find there.  Until then, 
; take care, and be aware.
