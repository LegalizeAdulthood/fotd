; FOTD -- October 10, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's fractal we turn to the cmplxmarksmand formula of 
; Fractint.  By adding an exponent to C, this formula is capable 
; of doing some very rude things to the classic Mandelbrot set, 
; from tearing it apart to turning it inside out.  But for today's 
; fractal we have gone easy on the set, merely giving it a slight 
; split along its negative real axis.
; 
; Though the cmplxmarksmand formula can draw some very curious 
; variations of the M-set, they are still variations of the same 
; set.  The interesting fractals are all on the surface.  Except 
; along the line where the fractal splits, the depths of the 
; fractals created by this formula are identical to those of the 
; M-set itself.
; 
; To create today's image, I have taken a midget on a filament 
; extending from a sub-bud on the south shore of the largest bud 
; of the M-set and caught it at the point where both it and its 
; twin on the north shore have just emerged from limbo and are 
; just splitting apart.  The result is a curious siamese-midget 
; kind of effect, with both halves sharing the same main-stem 
; midget, and appearing to be in a fight over it.
; 
; Since such an effect is one of the simplest things to do with 
; this formula, and also the first thing that comes to mind, I 
; could rate the image no higher than a 5.  The render time of 3 
; minutes gives an overall value of 166.
; 
; The task of rendering the image from the included parameter file 
; may be avoided by downloading the finished GIF image from the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The partly cloudy but hazy skies and temperature of 73F 23C 
; here at Fractal Central on Saturday were good enough to let 
; the fractal house-cats enjoy an afternoon of remaining nearly 
; invisible in the brush at the bottom of the yard.  Something in 
; the neighborhood appeared to have then skittish, but when meal 
; time came, they were out of the brush and into the kitchen in 
; less than a minute, eating vigorously.  Today's weather is 
; starting the same as yesterday's, though the haze has blown 
; away.  I expect another peaceful day for the cats.
; 
; For me the day looks uneventful, that is if I can talk my way 
; out of the trip to one of the local antique emporiums that the 
; fractal lady is planning for this aftertnoon.  Regardless of 
; what happens, the next FOTD fractal will appear in 24 hours or 
; so.  Until that moment of triumph, take care, and where did all 
; the angels go?
