; FOTD -- October 24, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The existence of Julia sets has been known for almost 100 years, 
; though their exact appearance was not determined until modern 
; computers were developed.  And when computers finally opened the 
; door to the world of fractals -- wow! were we surprised.  The 
; FOTD for today takes us on to the Julia version of the formula 
; Z^2+C, a formula that draws perhaps the most basic and simplest 
; of all fractals.  
; 
; This formula is so familiar and has been explored so thoroughly 
; that it is a bit difficult to find anything new in it.  But the 
; fractals it produces are infinite in number, and infinity is 
; inexhaustible.  To find today's image, I chose a point in a 
; basin of a midget deep in East Valley of the prominent midget on 
; the negative X-axis of the Mandelbrot set, and checked its 
; corresponding Julia set.  The image I came up with is not excep-
; tional -- I have seen many similar images -- but it is different 
; enough from what is normally pictured as a Julia set to qualify 
; as the FOTD for today.
; 
; I named the image "A Fractal Primeval".  When I saw it, I was 
; reminded of a scene deep in the primeval ocean of early earth, 
; at a time when life had just evolved to the level of multicel-
; lular organisms.  A few of these early creatures, if they can be 
; considered creatures, are illustrated, complete with infinitely 
; divided Cantor-style nuclei.  I doubt that these early forms of 
; life actually were colored the brilliant shade of red that I 
; gave them, but the strong coloring is what raised the image to 
; its rating of a 6.
; 
; The rating of 6 might be a bit excessive for such an ordinary 
; image.  I feel the image is worth its rating however.  And when 
; the render time of under 10 seconds is figured in, the overall 
; worth registers an amazing and grossly inflated 3681.
; 
; The image may be seen by running the included parameter file and 
; waiting a few seconds, or, if your computer is Fractint chal-
; lenged, by downloading the completed GIF image from the FOTD web 
; site maintained by Paul Lee at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A fine sunny day here at Fractal Central on Saturday was kept 
; from being perfect by a slightly-too-chilly temperature of 55F 
; 13C.  The cats did not seem to mind however, and spent most of 
; the afternoon in the yard, doing what fractal cats do best.  
; They came in at sunset as soon as they heard the food being 
; opened, and enjoyed a treat of turkey and tuna.  Today is 
; starting not so sunny, with sprinkles of rain already falling.  
; The day could go any way at all, so check back in 24 hours to 
; see how the cats make out.  The next glorious (IMO) fractal will 
; also be available right here at that time.  Until then, take 
; care, and what a lovely bunch of fractals fills the cosmos.
