; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we turn to the Halley formula of Fractint, which is one of 
; my favorite formulas.  It converges on roots of polynomials much 
; like the Newton's formulas, but with much more control over the 
; appearance of the images.  The 'epsilon' parameter controls how 
; close to the actual roots the points must come before calcula-
; tion is stopped.  The 'relaxation' parameter has nothing to do 
; with relaxing after a hard day's work.  It controls the amount 
; of chaos in the image.  A value above one allows more chaos, 
; while less than one keeps the chaos under tighter control.  An 
; imaginary value, such as I used in today's image, twists the 
; entire scene.
; 
; The colors are determined by the number of iterations needed to 
; reach the point where the change is less than the value assigned 
; 'epsilon'.  The smaller this value, the more iterations will be 
; needed, and the greater the opportunity for chaos to sneak in.  
; Today's image uses a value of an extremely small 10^(-15), which 
; brings out all potential chaos.
; 
; In addition to total chaos between roots, some settings of the 
; Halley parameters produce total chaos along the borders between 
; areas of different numbers of iterations to the same root.  This 
; is the case in the purplish areas of today's image, where magni-
; fication will reveal that no two adjoining areas actually touch. 
; Regardless of the magnitude, there is always chaos along the 
; 'borders'.  Though it usually consists of only two colors, this 
; chaos is interesting in itself.  Sometimes, as in today's image, 
; it is totally chaotic, while at other times, unexpected geome-
; tric patterns appear.  I am not sure whether this chaos is part 
; of the formula or an artifact of the math routine, but it is 
; curious nevertheless.
; 
; One of the early versions of today's image was colored with a 
; turquoise theme, and resembled an undersea scene, with air 
; bubbles rising toward the surface.  I named it "The Rage of 
; Poseidon".  (If I remember my mythology correctly, Poseidon is 
; the god of the sea, who really had it in for Ulysses for 
; blinding his cyclops son.)  I have since totally changed the 
; color scheme to something more like a view down into the pit of 
; hell, but I have kept the angry oceanic name.
; 
; I would have rated the image at a 7, but I have a certain 
; aversion to spirals, of which today's image is a perfect exam-
; ple, so I could rate it no higher than a 6.  When the brief 
; render time of just under 4 minutes is considered, the overall 
; worth equals a humdrum 153.
; 
; The image may be rendered from the included parameter file or 
; downloaded, already completed, from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather remained uneventful here at Fractal Central on 
; Monday.  The partly sunny skies and temperature of 59F 15C were 
; barely good enough to meet the quality standards of the fractal 
; cats, who spent less than an hour lounging testily in the yard.  
; Things will be no better for the duo today, since it is 
; starting wet and chilly.  They will not like this.
; 
; The next FOTD is but 24 hours away.  Until then, take care, and 
; don't surrender to fractal terrorism.
