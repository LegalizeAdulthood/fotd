; FOTD -- October 01, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today I have good news!
; 
; Starting today, the FOTD will resume its daily schedule.  This 
; schedule will continue, with occasional interruptions, for the 
; foreseeable future, bringing new and hopefully greater fractal 
; wonders each and every day.
; 
; It has been sometimes said that I give too little attention to 
; the built-in fractal types of Fractint.  To correct this 
; possible oversight, I have decided to post a FOTD created by 
; each of the fractal types in turn, starting with today's image, 
; which was created by the Barnsley-1 Julia formula.  I believe 
; that this series of formulas first appeared in Dr. Michael 
; Barnsley's book "Fractals Everywhere".  For now, I will confine 
; my explorations to the escape-time fractal types.
; 
; Having devoted so much time and effort to my own formulas, I 
; have done very little exploring in the fractals created by some 
; of these formulas, making them almost new.  This should assure 
; as exciting a trip for me as for the readers.
; 
; Today's stop in the fractal created by the Barnsley j1 formula 
; rates a 5.  I am sure that this formula has far better images 
; latent in it, but having done almost no exploring, I have set-
; tled for the best I could find after 27 minutes of exploration.
; 
; The image has a rather sharp, scratchy feeling to it, which 
; reminds me of the thicket of prickly brush at the bottom of the 
; fractal yard, where the fractal cats go to feel safe when they 
; sense a threat in the vicinity.  The name "Fractal Briars" seems 
; quite appropriate.
; 
; Since the image is part of a Julia set, it can hold no Mandel-
; brot midgets.  Instead of a midget at the center, we have a 
; symmetrical area of chaos that reveals additional interesting 
; scenes as one dives ever deeper into it.
; 
; The render time of 25 seconds raises the merely average rating 
; of a 5 to a very impressive 1190, one of the highest overall 
; values of all time.  Those who would rather not render may find 
; the finished image available for download on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather here at Fractal Central on Thursday threatened 
; showers, but nothing ever developed.  The sun between clouds and 
; temperature of 75F 24C were perfect for fractal cats.  The two 
; local ones made the most of it by enjoying the entire afternoon 
; in the yard.  When supper time arrived, they came indoors 
; without complaint.
; 
; For me, only a few traces of the work backlog remain to be 
; cleared away, and those will be gone by the weekend.  The next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours at this same place.  Until then, 
; take care, and what is it all about?
