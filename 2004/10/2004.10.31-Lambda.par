; FOTD -- October 31, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal image was created using the lambda formula of 
; Fractint, a formula that draws Julia sets.  In this formula, Z 
; is initialized as Z(pixel) and the iterated expression 
; multiplies Z by a user-defined value (lambda), then multiplies 
; the product by (1-Z).  The result is a variety of Julia sets not 
; too different from the standard Z^2+C sets.
; 
; For today's image I chose an entire Julia set that closely 
; resembles the Julia sets associated with East Valley of the 
; M-set.  The resemblance is not exact however, for today's image 
; contains elements that join together in ways not seen in the 
; classic Julia sets.
; 
; Not too enthused with the images I was able to wring from this 
; formula, I cut my search rather short and settled on a fractal 
; that has little in it that has not been seen many times before.  
; I put a modicum of effort into coloring the image, finally 
; deciding on the greyish-blue theme with greenish highlights, 
; areas of vague pink, and a brilliant white filling the deep 
; basins.    I named the final product "Lambda".
; 
; When rating time arrived, I could find nothing in the image 
; worth more than a 4, so a 4 is what I rated it.  Luckily, the 
; render time is quite short, so the overall worth rates an 
; inflated 823.  (I must adjust the way I calculate the overall 
; worth.  The way it is now, far too much weight is put on the 
; render time.)
; 
; The completed image is available on the internet at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A heavy overcast and a temperature of 64F 18C made Saturday 
; afternoon less than ideal here at Fractal Central.  The cats 
; disapproved of the lack of warm sun, and showed their 
; displeasure by adopting their sulk attitudes.  They did not 
; lighten up until they were served warmed tuna and turkey.  Today 
; is starting with enough blue sky, but the wind is up, and 
; fractal cats do not like wind, which hides the sound of 
; approaching danger.  It remains to be seen how they will adapt.
; 
; I expect to adapt to the conditions just fine.  The next fractal 
; is already in the bag, and will be released in only 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and be inquisitive.
