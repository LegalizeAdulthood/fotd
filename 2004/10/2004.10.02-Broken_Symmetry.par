; FOTD -- October 02, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal takes us to the second escape-time fractal of 
; the large built-in library of Fractint, the barnsleyj2 formula, 
; which like yesterday's formula, the barnsleyj1, first appeared 
; in Barnsley's book "Fractals Everywhere".  The fractals produced 
; by the barnsleyj2 formula are quite like those produced by the 
; barnsleyj1 formula, at least this is how it appears to me.  I 
; have done only an insignificant amount of exploration however, 
; and have almost certainly missed the most interesting fractals 
; these formulas can draw.
; 
; I might have done better if I had started with the Mandelbrot 
; versions of the Barnsley formulae.  Then I would have formed 
; some idea of the variety possible before jumping right into the 
; Julia sets.  But my intention is to work through all the 
; escape-time formulas in order, and this clueless rambling is 
; how it goes at the start.
; 
; Like yesterday's image, today's image is centered on one of the 
; points of symmetry that fill the parent fractal.  And once again 
; I could give a rating no higher than an average 5.  The coloring 
; helps a little, the blue background giving the impression of 
; bits and pieces of fractal debris swirling in infinite space -- 
; one of my favorite themes.  After a short consideration, I named 
; the image "Broken Symmetry".
; 
; After short trips into the first two of Barnsley's Julia 
; formulae, I am only mildly impressed by their potential.  I have 
; seen similar and even far more interesting 'bits-and-pieces' 
; images created by the MandelbrotBC2 branch-cut formula when it 
; is used to investigate the Mandeloids that result when powers of 
; Z between 1 and 2 are iterated.
; 
; Perhaps the best feature of today's image is its lightning 
; speed.  Less than 28 seconds to render a fractal is unusual, 
; even in this day of gigahertz machines.  And this speed raises 
; the humble rating of 5 to a whopping overall value of 1087.  I 
; can already see the world's fractalists rushing to their 
; computers to render the image.
; 
; But unfortunately, some modern computers do not support the old 
; DOS video modes used by Fractint.  Those with such new-fangled, 
; over-featured, under-performing machines can still see the image 
; however by downloading it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather was totally perfect here at Fractal Central on 
; Friday.  What could be better than light winds, a cloudless sky, 
; and a temperature of 77F 25C?  The fractal cats fully agreed.  
; They spent the afternoon lounging in the holly thicket at the 
; bottom of the yard, not showing themselves until I rang the 
; dinner bell (a spoon on a can of cat food) at sundown.  Today is 
; starting cloudy and drizzly, with heavier rain due in a few 
; hours.  The fractal duo have not yet seen the deteriorating 
; conditions.  Hopefully, they had such a pleasant time yesterday 
; that they will not mind a few drops on their ears today.
; 
; With about three hours effort, I should be able to empty the 
; in-shelf beside my desk of all waiting work.  Then I will have 
; no excuses for submitting less-than-perfect fractals.  Until 
; tomorrow, take care, and when a fractal goes sour, sprinkle a 
; little sugar on it.
