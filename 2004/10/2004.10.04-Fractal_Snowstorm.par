; FOTD -- October 04, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I see a micro-debate brewing about the rating of the FOTD 
; fractal images.  To settle this matter I must state that the 
; fractals have no totally objective accurate ratings.  The 
; ratings that I give to a posted image reflect my mood at the 
; time I rate the image.  This rating is always correct.  Someone 
; else may think more or less of the same image and rate it higher 
; or lower accordingly.  This different rating is also correct.
; 
; The correct rating is whatever one feels when viewing an image.  
; It's kind of a quantum thing, where the observation is part of 
; the thing being observed.  Curiously, when I go back in my files 
; and look at my past images, the ratings I would give them are 
; usually quite different.
; 
; For today's image I returned to the barnsleyj2 formula, but 
; before entering the C-value I checked the Mandelbrot version of 
; the same formula to get some preliminary idea of what might be 
; found in the Julia sets.  Though some curious images are to be 
; found when imag(c) is negative, I chose a point near the north-
; west shoreline of the M-set, with a positive imag(c) value and a 
; negative real(c) value.
; 
; The resulting Julia set resembles a snowstorm, almost demanding 
; the title "Fractal Snowstorm".  The rating of a 6 is above 
; average, but only slightly so.  The incredibly fast render time 
; of 10+ seconds is partly due to the origin symmetry, and raises 
; the overall value of the image to an apocalyptic 3333.
; 
; Rather than running the included parameter file, those with 
; Fractint-handicapped machines may download the completed GIF 
; image from the FOTD web site, which may be found at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A perfect day on Sunday resulted in perfect cats here at F.C.  
; Cloudless skies and a temperature of 73F 23C made outdoor 
; conditions perfect for the duo, who, in addition to canned cat 
; food, thrive on canned tuna, sliced turkey, cheddar cheese, 
; spanish rice, as well as a mystery dish that the fractal lady 
; occasionally prepares, which is officially nameless, but which 
; I refer to as 'gook'.  (No one is offended by the name because 
; I mention the mystery dish by name only after finishing a huge 
; serving of it.  And it is actually quite good!)
; 
; Unfortunately, there will be no gook today, but there is enough 
; money-making work to keep me busy for a few hours.  And then 
; it's on to Fractal Land, and probably that skeptical magazine.  
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and abide in peace, knowing that fractals are everywhere.
