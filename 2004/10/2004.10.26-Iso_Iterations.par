; FOTD -- October 26, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's image we return for a second go at the julia(fn||fn) 
; formula.  I am giving the formula a second chance because I feel 
; that yesterday's below-average image failed to do justice to it. 
; For today's image I began by setting both functions to sqr, a 
; setting that draws the familiar Z^2+C Julia sets.
; 
; With an 'East Valley' Julia set on the screen, I changed the 
; second function to 'tan' and reset the shift value to 5.5.  The 
; result was spectacular -- a fractal with more places of interest 
; than a drop of water has molecules.  The Julia set has been 
; surrounded by rings and decorated with all kinds of gingerbread. 
; In addition, spurious bits and pieces of very distorted J-sets 
; have sprung up in the suburbs, where little would normally be 
; expected.  I chose a scene in one of these outlying areas, tried 
; the various 'outside' options, chose the 'summ' option, and let 
; the iterations roll.
; 
; After only 35 seconds of rolling, today's image appeared on the 
; screen.  I took around 15 minutes working up a color palette 
; that would bring out the multi-level image that I saw in the 
; scene.  The final result is today's Fractal of the Day.
; 
; The formula undoubtedly has even better images in it, but at 
; least, with today's image and its rating of a 7, I feel that 
; justice has been done, and it is time to move on to the next 
; formula.  The very brief render time of 35 seconds results in an 
; overall worth of 1195, and that rating is not to be sneezed at, 
; especially in a time of flu vaccine shortage.
; 
; I named today's image "Iso-Iterations", which means 'lines of 
; equal iteration.  I gave it this name before I set the outside 
; to 'summ', a setting that creates bands in an entirely different 
; manner.
; 
; The image may be seen by running the included parameter file or 
; by letting Paul run it and downloading the finished image from 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The clouds hung tough all day Monday here at Fractal Central.  
; The fractal cats hung tough in their bad moods.  Even the tuna 
; left them a bit sullen.  A lack of sun and a temperature of 57F 
; 14C are not very pleasing to cats of the fractal variety.  The 
; clouds appear far less tenacious this morning, with even a few 
; patches of blue showing through.  If all goes well, we will have 
; full sun and happy cats by noon.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and a fractal rating a whopping 9-1/2 will appear in 3 days.
