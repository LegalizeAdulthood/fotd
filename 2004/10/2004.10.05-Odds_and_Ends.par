; FOTD -- October 05, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's FOTD we turn to the third of the three Barnsley 
; Julia formulas.  Unlike the first two formulas, which draw 
; images filled with discontinuities, this formula draws images 
; that are stretched out in a manner very closely resembling the 
; odd-angle slices through the four-dimensional Julibrot, a 
; coincidence that leads me to wonder whether something similar 
; is going on here.
; 
; Actually, I found the barnsleyj3 formula the least interesting 
; of the three Barnsley-Julia formulas.  Most of the images it 
; produces can be approximated by one of the formulas that draws 
; slices in odd directions through the Z^2+C Julibrot figure, or 
; even by some of the warped Mandelbrot sets.  But on the other 
; hand, the lack of potential in this formula may be due to my own 
; inexperience in working with it.
; 
; I doubt that the fault is mine however.  When a formula has 
; great potential, such as the MandelbrotMix4 formula, I usually 
; recognize it at once.  Perhaps the final word is that, after 
; using the formula for today's image, I doubt that I will ever 
; return to it.
; 
; But then again, it is not too unusual for me to completely miss 
; great fractals.
; 
; I named today's image "Odds and Ends".  I gave it this name 
; because I could find nothing in it to inspire a more descriptive 
; name.  The rating of 4 seems honest, maybe even a bit inflated.  
; The short render time of 41.75 seconds gives an overall value of 
; 575, which means that if you feel you have wasted time and effort 
; by rendering the image, at least it will not be much time.
; 
; For tomorrow's FOTD I will tackle the barnsleym1 formula.  And 
; who knows, I might find something totally unexpected.

; 
; Fractal Central was blessed with another absolutely perfect day 
; on Monday, and I was blessed with very happy cats.  Crystal blue 
; skies and a temperature of 75F 24C kept the duo happy all day, 
; while I was kept happy by the lack of a work backup.  This 
; morning is starting much chillier however, and I fear the chill 
; wind that is blowing may be too much for the delicate ears of 
; the cats.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear, almost by magic, at this same place 
; around the same time tomorrow.  Hopefully, the image will rate 
; better than a measly 4.  If all goes well, I will have today's 
; small amount of commercial work behind me around 3pm, which will 
; give me a chance to browse the 'Skeptical Inquirer' magazine 
; lying on the shelf behind me.  Until tomorrow then, take care, 
; and become one with something.
