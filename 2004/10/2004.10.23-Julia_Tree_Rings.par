; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the julfn+zsqrd formula of Fractint, a 
; formula that gave me a fight when I tried to wring a respectful 
; fractal from it.  I finally won the battle by investigating the 
; Mandelbrot variations of the formula and finding the parameters 
; likely to produce interesting Julia sets by noting the coordi-
; nates of the interesting places in the M-sets.
; 
; Several functions produced interesting Mandelbrot sets.  I 
; decided to check the Julia sets associated with the shoreline of 
; the M-set that results when the 'cabs' formula is applied.  The 
; first Julia set I checked was a winner.  This winning set is an 
; extension in the remaining two dimensions of a point on the the 
; eastern shoreline of its M-set.  The set is illustrated in 
; today's image, which shows the entire Julia set, and looks sur-
; prisingly like yesterday's image.  I named today's image "Julia 
; Tree-Rings".  I thought of tree rings the moment I saw the image.
; 
; Such an easily created image can hardly be rated very far above 
; average, but I put a bit of extra coloring effort into the image, 
; and that coloring effort raises it to a slightly-above-average 
; rating of 6.
; 
; The rings that fill the inside of the Julia set appear very inte-
; resting as they are.  It might appear that they would grow even 
; more interesting as one zooms deeper, but a single inzoom will 
; reveal that they are fractal in nature, and continue dividing 
; into ever smaller similar rings.  The rings are ultimately dis-
; appointing, but they do however produce some interesting patterns 
; in the areas where they converge, and create images much like 
; yesterday's 'moirefan' image.
; 
; The render time of 6-3/4 seconds is unusually fast, and when com-
; bined with the rating of 6 results in an overall worth of a 
; grossly inflated 5333.  Those who are concerned about inflation 
; can download the image from the FOTD web site at:

; 
; The weather remained cloudy here at Fractal Central on Friday, 
; but the temperature warmed to 57F 14C and the wind was light, 
; which made things pleasant enough for the fractal cats to enjoy 
; several hours in the yard.  Today is starting sunny, and we are 
; promised more sun and warmer temperatures throughout the after-
; noon.  I hope the good weather actually holds up.  The cats do 
; not like broken promises.
; 
; I promised myself an actual day off this weekend, and with only 
; one minor job on the shelf beside the desk, it looks like I'll 
; keep that promise.  Luckily, I do not consider playing with 
; fractals to be work.  The next playful image will appear right 
; here in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and do palm trees have 
; rings inside their trunks that tell the tree's age?
