; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's unusual fractal takes us to the fn(z*z) fractal formula, 
; a formula that at first glance appears to have little to offer, 
; but proves quite rewarding when explored.  Like yesterday's 
; formula, today's formula draws some images that consist mostly 
; of blank 'inside' stuff that does not come to life until it is 
; activated by a suitable non-flat rendering method.  Today's 
; image consists almost entirely of 'inside' stuff brought to life 
; by the 'fmod' inside fill.  Only the brilliant center 'sun' and 
; the brilliant turquoise center dots surrounding it are made of 
; 'outside' material.
; 
; Quite surprising is the effect the 'fmod' inside fill has on 
; today's image.  This fill normally produces overlapping bubbles, 
; but in today's image it creates virtually the entire fractal 
; with its spider-like arms and smoothly gradated background.  
; This is the best job I have yet seen the 'fmod' fill do on a 
; fractal.  I must one day check to see what additional surprises 
; this fill has hidden in it.
; 
; In the fn(z*z) formula the function is obviously a major part of 
; the calculation.  To generate today's image I chose the cotanh 
; or hyperbolic cotangent function.  When the bailout radius is 
; set to 1, this function fills the screen with an unsurprising 
; hyperbolic pattern.  As the bailout radius is increased, the 
; solid pattern breaks down into separate bits and pieces that 
; grow smaller as the bailout is increased further, until they 
; finally vanish entirely, leaving a blank black screen of 
; 'inside' stuff.  For today's image, I settled on a bailout of 
; 1600, where the bits and pieces have grown quite small, but have 
; not yet entirely vanished.
; 
; When I am in scientific mode, I call such blank or nearly blank 
; screens 'virtual fractals' because they resemble sub-atomic 
; virtual particles that are caught halfway between existing and 
; not existing, and need only some extra energy to bring them to 
; full existence.  In today's case, the 'fmod' inside fill 
; supplies that energy.  In mystical mode, I call such blank 
; screens ghost images, because they resemble ghosts or spirits 
; that really exist but are invisible to our everyday sight.  In 
; this case, the 'fmod' fill gives us the psychic sight needed to 
; see the ghosts.
; 
; Today's image resembles nothing as much as a great eye.  I named 
; it "The All-Seeing Eye"  I leave it to the viewer to decide the 
; owner of the all-seeing eye.
; 
; With its rating of 8, today's image is the highest rated image 
; yet of my tour through Fractint.  The render time of under 2 
; minutes raises that rating to an overall worth of an impressive 
; 430.
; 
; As always, the minor job of image rendering may be avoided by 
; downloading the completed GIF image from the FOTD web site at:

; 
; A nondescript day here at Fractal Central on Thursday left the 
; fractal cats in an ambiguous mood.  Variably cloudy skies and a 
; temperature of 64F 18C, with light winds, were pleasant enough 
; for humans, but the duo could not decide how they wanted to 
; spend the afternoon.  They finally divided their time between 
; the porch and the holly thicket.  The clouds are thick this 
; morning, and rain is threatening, so I doubt that the cats will 
; have a better day.
; 
; For me, even if it rains, the day will be fair enough once the 
; work is finished.  And if all goes very well, I'll find a great 
; fractal.  Whatever happens, I'll return in 24 hours with the 
; next FOTD.  Until then, take care, and a great fractal is better 
; than a flu shot.
