; FOTD -- October 07, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have been a bit disappointed by my adventures so far in the 
; Barnsley formulas.  Maybe the reason is that they do not seem to 
; produce Mandelbrot midgets, which are my specialty.  What they 
; do produce is mostly the kind of images I pass by while using 
; the MandelbrotMix or BranchCut formulas.  Then maybe I am under-
; estimating these formulas.  After all, Barnsley considered them 
; good enough to include in his book "Fractals Everywhere" where 
; they first appeared.  I might do better with them if I read the 
; book.
; 
; Today's image, which was created by the barnsleym2 formula, is 
; totally a result of my effort.  I created and am totally respon-
; sible for the coloring, good or bad as it may be.  The fractal 
; program is innocent of any wrongdoing.  The image is basically a 
; different aspect of the "Metropolis" fractal of Oct 2, which was 
; created by the barnsleyj1 formula, but instead of resembling an 
; aerial view of a city street grid, it resembles a view looking 
; up into a windowed dome, with brilliant sunlight streaming 
; through.  I named the picture "Domed Windows" accordingly.
; 
; I rather like the hazy effect, and was tempted to give the image 
; a rating of something like an 8.  But since the picture was 
; created almost entirely by me, such a rating would have shouted, 
; "Jim the Great and Magnificent Fractalist!"  I do not consider 
; myself a great fractalist, only a stubbornly persistent one, so 
; I rated the image at a more conservative 6, which is still 
; better than the recent FOTD's.
; 
; The October fractals, though not great, have so far been very 
; speedy indeed.  With its render time of only 17 seconds, today's 
; image continues the lightning trend.  The fast render time gives 
; today's image an exaggerated overall value of 2091.  Fast as it 
; may be, the render time can be eliminated entirely by download-
; ing the finished image from the FOTD web site at:

; 
; Wednesday started perfect, stayed perfect, and ended perfectly 
; perfect here at Fractal Central.  The cats, who like things 
; perfect, were perfectly happy.  True, things got a bit tense 
; when the new cat on the block wandered into the yard, but as 
; soon as Tippy went into fighting mode and started toward the 
; intruder with back arched and tail bristled, the other cat 
; quickly retreated.  As usual, Thomas merely watched.  The day 
; ended with two happy cats enjoying their Fancy Feast cat food.  
; Today is promising to be even more perfect, if such a thing is 
; possible.
; 
; With the commercial work completely caught up, my day was also 
; perfect -- well maybe not absolutely perfect but near-perfect.  
; A perfect 10-rated fractal would have been necessary to make the 
; day absolutely perfect.  The next fractal will appear in 24 
; hours, and I will likely have a few kind words to say about it.  
; Until that moment arrives, take care, and watch where you wander 
; in the world of fractals.
