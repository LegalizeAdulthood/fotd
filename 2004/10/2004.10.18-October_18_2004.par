; FOTD -- October 18, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The problem with today's image is that I could find no 
; satisfactory name for it.  Normally, I find the FOTD names 
; almost automatically as I study the images (yes, this sometimes 
; produces duplicate names).  But after studying today's image for 
; nearly 1/2 hour, and finding no satisfactory name for it, I 
; finally decided to identify the image by giving it the name of 
; the date on which it appears.  (If I had done this with all the 
; past FOTD images, I would have a far easier time identifying and 
; finding them.)
; 
; I used the 'fn+fn' formula built into Fractint to create today's 
; image.  Like the recent formulas that use the Fractint 
; functions, this formula can draw a vast variety of fractals.  
; Not all of the possible fractals this formula can create are 
; useful however, but many are quite interesting.  To create 
; today's image, I chose to combine 0.4 imaginary part of cosxx(Z) 
; with 0.4 imaginary part of sqr(Z).  (The cosxx function is not a 
; legitimate math function.  It is a coding error that appeared in 
; an early version of Fractint, but drew enough interesting 
; fractals to make it worth keeping in the program when the error 
; was corrected.)
; 
; To add some extra life to today's image, I rendered it with the 
; outside set to 'atan' and the inside set to 'bof61'.  
; Surprisingly, the maxiter of the image, which is 95, has a great 
; effect on its appearance.  As the maxiter is increased, the 
; foreground objects grow rapidly larger, until the greyish-blue 
; background is soon filled in, resulting in a more detailed, but 
; IMO less interesting image.  (I am one of those who appreciates 
; vast empty spaces.)
; 
; Maybe if I had found a proper name for the image, I would have 
; rated it at a 6.  But the fruitless search soured me on it, and 
; in the end, all I could give it was a rating of an average 5.  
; The humdrum rating really surges to life however when the almost 
; instant render time of 4 seconds is considered, resulting in an 
; overall worth of a shocking 5822.
; 
; The completed GIF image is or soon will be available on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A sunny but rather chilly day here at Fractal central on Sunday 
; made for rather cool cats.  The duo prefers a temperature above 
; the 57F 14C, which was as warm as it got on Sunday.  They showed 
; their displeasure by demanding (and getting) an extra serving of 
; tuna.  Today is starting just as cool.  The cats might turn even 
; cooler.  Lckily, we have a lot of tuna in the cabinet.
; 
; My next task is to find a cool fractal.  Since the number of 
; fractals is infinite, my chance of doing so must be 100 percent.  
; But somehow, it just doesn't seem to work out that way.  I'll be 
; back here in 24 hours with a cool fractal.  If I can't find a 
; cool one, I'll have a hot one.  Until then, take care, and don't 
; lose your cool when you see a hot fractal.
