; FOTD -- October 09, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal was created with the cmplxmarksjul formula of 
; Fractint, a formula that draws variations of the standard Z^2+C 
; Julia sets.  Today's image is a variation of the very familiar 
; Seahorse Valley or C=(-0.75) Julia set.
; 
; When the exponent of C is a whole number, the cmplxmarksjul 
; formula creates images resembling those created by the familiar 
; Julia formula, though the size of the Julia sets increases as 
; the value of the exponent is increased.  When the exponent is 
; fractional, the overall shape of the cmplxmarksjul fractals 
; departs in certain areas quite a bit from the shape of the 
; fractals created by the familiar Julia formula, though the 
; smaller inner detail remains unchanged.  As is the case with 
; all the formulas I rarely investigate, I have probably missed 
; the most interesting possibilities of the formula.
; 
; Continuing the biblical theme of yesterday, I have named today's 
; image "Julia Snake".  I gave it this name not because there is 
; something evil about it, but because something about it reminds 
; me of a squirming snake.  Snakes are still not the most pleasant 
; things on earth, so I could rate the image no higher than a 5, 
; but the very brief render time of 54 seconds raises the rating 
; to a lofty overall value of 556.
; 
; Tomorrow's image will be a scene in the Mandelbrot aspect of the 
; same formula.  Hopefully, I will find something that rates 
; higher than a 5.
; 
; As I stated above, today's image takes 54 seconds to render.  It 
; also takes about 54 seconds to download from the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The means of viewing the image is left to the viewer.
; 
; Perfect weather Friday, with sun and a temperature of 77F 25C, 
; made the cats happy.  Unfortunately, it did not make Tippy happy 
; enough to make friends with the new cat in the area.  When the 
; new guy ventured into the yard, Tippy sent him scurrying.  Then 
; Tippy returned to the porch to be greeted by Thomas.
; 
; I expect a rather peaceful day for a change.  And peace is what 
; I need to inspire me to find those elusive great fractals.  One 
; of them might appear tomorrow, then again, it might not.  Check 
; back in 24 hours to see what happens.  Until next time, take 
; care, and remain alert for those angels.
