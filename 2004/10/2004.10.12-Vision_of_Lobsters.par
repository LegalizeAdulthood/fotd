; FOTD -- October 12, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To get a fair assessment of the many formulas in Fractint, it 
; would be necessary to spend at least a month with each one, and 
; not the mere hour or so that I am now spending.  But even an 
; hour can give a basic idea of what a formula has to offer, and 
; besides, if I were to spend a month with each formula, it would 
; be quite a few years before I finished the Fractint tour.
; 
; Today's image takes us to the complexnewton formula.  This 
; formula works the same as the complexbasin formula that created 
; yesterday's image, but instead of coloring the points according 
; to which root they converge on, today's formula colors the 
; points according to how many iterations it takes for the points 
; to reach the root.
; 
; Since we are searching for an imaginary root in today's image, 
; we find an infinity of complex solutions waiting for us, 
; arranged in a truly fractal pattern.  Regardless of how deep we 
; search, there are always an infinity of similar smaller basins 
; and their roots ahead of us.
; 
; Since the process is unending and the detail appears to change 
; little, I stopped my search at a relatively shallow depth when I 
; found today's scene.  Actually, there is nothing unusual about 
; today's scene.  With small variations, the entire parent 
; fractal, which is infinite in size, looks the same as the tiny 
; part visible in today's image.  This parent very graphically 
; displays the infinite multi-dimensional spiral that results 
; because of the multi-valued functions used in the calculation.
; 
; When the time arrived to give my latest creation a name, I 
; studied the image for nearly 10 minutes.  Then, for some reason, 
; I started imagining lobsters in the image.  I named the picture 
; "Vision of Lobsters".  Thanks to its brilliant coloring, the 
; image is rated higher than the recent ones.  I decided on a 
; rating of 6, which the render time of 1 minute and 23 seconds 
; raises to an absolute value of a respectable 429.
; 
; Skipping over the diffusion fractal type, which draws fractal 
; trees, and the dynamic type, which draws diamonds, tomorrow's 
; image will explore the 'escher' fractal, which does strange 
; things with Julia sets.  Exactly how strange these things are 
; will have to wait until tomorrow to be determined.
; 
; Today's image may be seen by running the included parameter file 
; or by downloading it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Monday was slightly breezy and chilly here at Fractal Central.  
; The temperature never rose above 62F 17C, but the duo of fractal 
; cats braved the harsh outdoors for all of 1/2 hour.  I braved 
; the harshness by sitting in front of my fractal-dedicated 
; computer and seeing what I could wring out of the complexnewton 
; formula.
; 
; Today is starting less harsh; I expect more bravery from the 
; cats.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and when life gets harsh, soothe yourself with a fractal.
