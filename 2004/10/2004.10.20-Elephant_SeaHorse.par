; FOTD -- October 20, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD takes us to the hypercomplex formula of Fractint, 
; which draws a four-dimensional version of the Mandelbrot set.  
; At one time I used this formula quite extensively, but since 
; then I have written my own formula, the HyperMandelbrot, which 
; draws all the same images plus many new images that the hyper-
; complex formula does not.
; 
; The hypercomplex formula is not to be cast aside as outmoded 
; however.  It still draws some very interesting images, and it 
; draws them faster than my own formula.  In a case like today's, 
; where the image takes over one hour to render, speed becomes 
; quite important.  In addition, the hypercomplex formula is the 
; only one in which the various functions can be applied.
; 
; Being four-dimensional, the overall shape of the hypercomplex 
; Mandelbrot set is impossible to visualize, but when the function 
; is 'sqr', it can be taken as two familiar Mandelbrot sets partly 
; overlapping.  The position of the overlapping sets is controlled 
; by the Z parameter.  The other functions produce different 
; figures, but the figures behave in pretty much the same way.
; 
; The most interesting parts of the fractals drawn by the hyper-
; complex formula are the places where different parts of the two 
; overlapping M-sets intersect.  One such place is seen in today's 
; image, which shows an intersection of Elephant Valley and 
; Seahorse Valley.
; 
; When two elements intersect, the element with the lower itera-
; tion count always obliterates the higher.  In today's image, 
; Seahorse Valley appears as the brownish shaft shooting up the 
; center of the frame, while the rest of the scene is a part of 
; Elephant valley.  Examine the brownish elephant-trunk features 
; just above the center of the frame.  The elephant spirals do not 
; go on indefinitely, as would be expected.  Instead, as their 
; iteration count increases, they grow more diffuse as they grow 
; smaller, until their iteration count finally becomes higher than 
; the count of Seahorse Valley, which until now they have been 
; obscuring, and they vanish entirely.  The moral of all this is, 
; 'once a point escapes, it is not coming back'.
; 
; I named the image "Elephant-Seahorse", because it is a combina-
; tion of both valleys.  I rated it at a 6, more for its mathema-
; tical interest than its artistic worth.
; 
; The unusually slow render time of 1 hour 18 minutes reduces the 
; overall worth to a pathetic 7.6.  But that abysmal worth can be 
; ignored by downloading the file of the completed GIF image from 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A chilly rain here at Fractal Central on Tuesday, with a temper-
; ature of 52F 11C, kept the dynamic duo of fractal cats indoors 
; all day.  They accepted their confinement stoically, though an 
; extra treat of tuna was needed to help them find their stoicism. 
; Today is starting chilly and cloudy, but at least it is dry.  
; What the cats will make of this is anybody's guess.
; 
; My guess is that the next FOTD will appear in 24 hours, and it 
; is a pretty fair guess that the image will be memorable.  Until 
; that glorious moment arrives, take care, and search for the 
; hidden meaning in fractals.
