; FOTD -- October 29, 2004 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's FOTD we move on to the julzpower formula of Frac-
; tint, where we find the second-highest-rated FOTD image of all 
; time.  The formula is one of the simplest in the program, 
; drawing the Julia sets that result when Z is raised to any power 
; and C is added.  The power I chose for today's image is 1.5, the 
; value that I find creates the most interesting fractals in the 
; exponent range between 1 and 2.
; 
; It is said that fractals are everywhere.  This is likely true, 
; but hardly anywhere are they more obvious than in the fractal 
; structure of trees.  As today's image shows, the formula that 
; creates trees may be surprisingly simple -- no more complicated 
; than Z^(1.5)+C.
; 
; Very early in my fractal adventures I discovered a family of 
; fractal trees, one of which is illustrated in today's image.  
; Several close relatives of today's tree have already appeared in 
; one of the earliest of the FOTD images, the image that was named 
; "Snaketree".
; 
; It may be debatable whether today's unusually simple image is 
; worth the 9.5 rating that I gave it.  It certainly is a striking 
; image, leaving no doubt of why I named it "A Tree in Spring".  I 
; spent much more time coloring the image than I did in finding 
; it.  In fact, I added the extra half-point to the rating because 
; of the extra effort I put into the color palette.
; 
; When the brief render time of under 2 minutes is considered, the 
; overall worth registers an impressive 546.  This is not the high-
; est overall worth of all time, but the ridiculously higher 
; worths were achieved because of very brief render times rather 
; than image quality.
; 
; The image may be enjoyed by running the included parameter file, 
; or by downloading the completed GIF image from:

; 
; Thursday proved to be the best day of the week here at Fractal 
; Central.  The warm sun and temperature of 61F 16C brought out 
; the best in the cats, who passed the afternoon in the depths of 
; the holly thicket, feeling like prowling tigers.  Nothing 
; special was needed to end the day happily.  But this morning has 
; dawned cloudy, and the cats could be less happy by the time 
; evening arrives.
; 
; The work is still caught up and the supply of fractals is no-
; where near being exhausted.  Be sure not to miss the next one, 
; which will appear in 24 hours.  It might not be as good as 
; today's, but it will be worth seeing.  Until then, take care, 
; and which order of infinity is the set of all possible fractals?
