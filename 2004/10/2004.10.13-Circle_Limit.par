; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is named "Circle-Limit".  And why not?  The 
; formula that drew it is named 'escher_julia', and Escher drew 
; several similar pictures which he named 'Circle Limit'.
; 
; The 'escher_julia' formula draws circles filled with a variety 
; of Julia-set parts.  For today's image I chose a point near 
; Seahorse Valley of the Mandelbrot set as the starting para-
; meters.  These parameters only partly fill the circle with 
; 'outside' features.  Much of what appears inside the circle is 
; 'inside' stuff.  This presents no problem.  I rendered the image 
; with the inside set to 'bof61', which gives a nice shaded back-
; ground to the 'outside' features inside the circle.
; 
; The image is a kind of graphic representation of a space of 
; negative curvature, in which there is more space out there than 
; would seem possible.  In such a space, things appear smaller 
; than their distance would indicate.  If our universe has such a 
; curvature, it will expand forever until it dies a slow death 
; from increasing entropy.  At least that is the old idea.  But we 
; are currently wrestling with all kinds of new forces and new 
; ideas about the fate of the universe, and I'm not sure what its 
; fate is now theorized to be.  And even if we do determine its 
; fate, how do we know that the universe will actually do what we 
; theorize it must?  It's all simply an interesting intellectual 
; exercise.
; 
; Today's image is a little above the average run of FOTD images, 
; and earned an honest 6.  Its speedy render time of 25 seconds 
; results in an overall value of a huge 1395.
; 
; The image may be viewed by booting the Fractint program and 
; running the included parameter file, or by downloading the 
; completed GIF file from the FOTD web site at:

; 
; Tuesday was a bit chilly here at Fractal Central, but the sun 
; was warm and the wind was light, permitting the fractal cats two 
; pleasant midday hours of lounging on the porch, enjoying the 
; sun.  They took all the porch sun they could get.  The sun is 
; dropping lower, already skimming the tops of the holly trees 
; even at midday, and in a week or so, the porch will be shaded 
; all day.  This morning I see clouds already moving in.  With 
; clouds and occasional rain expected for the rest of the week, 
; the cats will likely be disappointed.
; 
; With the today's fractal rating above average, I feel reasonably 
; satisfied, but far better things should be possible, so I'll try 
; again tomorrow on another formula.  Until then, take care, and 
; be careful not to bump into a fractal in the dark.  Some of them 
; have very jagged edges.
