; FOTD -- October 16, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image, which rates a 7, was created by the fn*fn 
; formula.  This formula doesn't bother with a constant term such 
; as Z or C, it merely multiplies two functions and plugs the 
; product back into the formula.  When I brought up the formula, 
; I expected little of interest to come from it, and indeed, for a 
; while nothing did.  But then I tried multiplying the cotan and 
; cotanh functions, and activating the mainly blank screen with 
; the bof61 inside fill.  The result was a screen filled with 
; chaos, but with little delicate and interesting objects of order 
; scattered among the chaos.  Today's image reveals one of these 
; bits of order.
; 
; It is not surprising that a formula that includes a hyperbolic 
; function should draw a hyperbola.  And that is exactly what we 
; find at the center of the large semi-orderly area.  Don't bother 
; zooming into the center of this hyperbola -- I already did, and 
; found that it's hyperbolae all the way down.
; 
; The large central object in today's image reminds me of a 
; fossil, so I named it "Fractal Fossil".  The rating of a 7 might 
; be a bit exaggerated, but the image really is a rather unusual 
; one.  When the 4-minute render time is figured in, the overall 
; worth rates a respectable 173.
; 
; The rendering may be avoided by downloading the completed GIF 
; image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The heavy clouds and occasional rain hung around all day here at 
; Fractal Central on Friday, holding the temperature to 64F 18C 
; and keeping the dynamic duo of fractal cats confined to their 
; lookout shelf by the side window, where, due to the rain, there 
; was very little to look at.  The duo took their disappointment 
; rather well.  Today is starting blustery and chilly, but only a 
; few clouds are in the sky.  It is too early to determine what 
; the duo will make of it.
; 
; For the fractal human, the work is caught up, leaving a day with 
; not much to do but watch some games on TV and find a great 
; fractal.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours or I'll have a 
; good alibi ready.  Until next time, take care, and if nothing is 
; real, is the knowledge of that fact real?
