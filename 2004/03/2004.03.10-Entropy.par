; FOTD -- March 10, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To find today's image I returned to the same parent fractal that 
; held yesterday's scene, and investigated the large eastern 
; Mandeloid.  Instead of the East Valley area, I checked the tip 
; of the negative, or in this case, the main positive stem.
; 
; In contrast to the main stem of the classic Mandelbrot set, the 
; stem of the Mandeloid in today's fractal winds into a loose 
; spiral as it nears its end.  This spiral nature is reflected in 
; the pattern surrounding today's midget.
; 
; I named the image "Entropy", which is a word that refers to the 
; amount of disorder in a closed system.  Disorder refers to the 
; amount of energy unavailable for useful work.  Unless outside 
; energy is introduced, entropy always increases and the system 
; reaches a state of luke-warm death.  In some fractals, the 
; disorder seems infinite, in others there is nothing but order.  
; Some day soon I might wax philosophic about this, but today is 
; not the day.
; 
; Today's image is in a state of partial entropy, a fact that 
; inspired the name.  The rating of a 7, combined with the render 
; time of just under 14 minutes, gives an overall value of an even 
; 50.
; 
; The curious will run the parameter, the wise will download the 
; finished image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Tuesday passed chilly and cloudy here at Fractal Central.  The 
; temperature of 45F 7C was a bit too cold for the cats, who 
; ventured outdoors only long enough to smell a few bushes.  When 
; they sulked back inside, a generous treat of tuna eased their 
; troubles.
; 
; In my case, it will take a bit smaller pile of work waiting to 
; be done to ease my troubles.  The work will be finished however, 
; and the next fractal will appear on schedule in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and keep iterating.
