; FOTD -- March 13, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is an error.  When setting the parameters, I 
; inadvertently forgot to reset the formula function to 'floor'.  
; The results of the mistake were not all bad however.  Like the 
; 'Tim's error' formula in Fractint, the mixed-up formula produced 
; quite an interesting image.  So that this mix-up does not happen 
; again, I will rewrite the MandelbrotBC1 formula, rename it 
; MandelbrotBC2, and change the variable parameter to a fixed one. 
; But the image that was produced in error will keep its honored 
; position as FOTD for March 13.
; 
; The parent fractal consists of a large irregular bay with 
; several tiny bays along its smooth eastern shore.  The western 
; shore of the bay consists of what I call wetland -- a large area 
; of near total chaos.  But as today's image, which is a scene in 
; this wetland, shows, near total chaos does not equal uselessness.
; 
; I have given the image the simple name "Merely a Scene".  That's 
; what it is.  There is no sign of my ever-present midgets, though 
; some rudimentary ones do exist is other parts of the parent 
; fractal.  The image consists of a single shaft jutting down from 
; the top of the frame and meeting a fragment of a second shaft 
; near the bottom of the frame.  The distant background is filled 
; with similar shafts.  The main shaft has an unusually vivid 
; three-dimensional appearance, an effect that is not always easy 
; to achieve with colors alone.
; 
; I gave the image a rating of a 5.  The lack of a midget dropped 
; the rating as much as two points.  Another bad feature is the 
; slowness of the image, which takes over one hour to render on my 
; machine.  When the rating and render time are combined, the over-
; all value comes in at a lowly 7.2.
; 
; The hour wait for the image to render can be avoided by down-
; loading the completed GIF file from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The image is slow, so before visiting the site, give Paul a 
; chance to render and post it.
; 
; Too much wind and too low a temperature kept the fractal cats 
; confined indoors on Friday, but today is starting with much less 
; wind.  Hopefully, the temperature will rise to a level that is 
; acceptable to the cat duo.  If not, it's back to the tuna.
; 
; As for me, I've got a bit of work to finish, and then it's all 
; fun and games.  Until next time, take care, and if you don't 
; take care, watch out.
