; FOTD -- March 12, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There once was a time when I wandered freely through Fractal 
; Land, roaming wherever my day's journey took me to study the 
; surroundings.  I was not on a search for any particular quarry.  
; I photographed whatever was surrounding me in the place where I 
; stopped for the day.  Then something happened.  I became fasci-
; nated with the so-called 'midgets' that I occasionally stumbled 
; upon.  I began seeking midgets, ignoring the sometimes spectacu-
; lar scenery that I passed by in my search.
; 
; Midgets in fractals are higher-dimensional analogs of the maxi-
; mum or minimum stationary points so often found when the graphs 
; of functions are plotted.  And just as all stationary points 
; have a similar parabolic shape, so do all midgets have a similar 
; shape.  With only a few hard-to-find exceptions, this shape is 
; that of the classic Mandelbrot set.  The familiar shape is some-
; times distorted beyond recognition, but even when unrecognizable 
; the shape is there, and could be undistorted back into the M-set.
; 
; It is hard to say why I became so fascinated with midgets, but 
; this kind of thing seems to happen with fractals.  Many become 
; fascinated with spirals.  When I come upon spirals, which I do 
; many times in my search for midgets, I usually pass them by.  
; They all look the same to me.  It is curious that the same bore-
; dom has never arisen as I discover ever more of the super infi-
; nity of similarly shaped midgets that are out there, waiting to 
; be found.
; 
; Maybe I should devote a month or two to fractals without mid-
; gets.  The discontinuity patterns in low-order fractional-power 
; fractals can be quite interesting, and certainly deserve more 
; exploration.  The odd slices of the Z^2+C Julibrot can also be 
; interesting.  It is really surprising what Seahorse Valley looks 
; like when viewed from some of the unfamiliar angles and double 
; angles of four-dimensional space.  Yes, I think I'll soon take a 
; break from the endless stream of midgets, and have some fun with 
; the other things found in the world of fractals.
; 
; But that break from midgets does not appear in today's image, 
; which is another adventure into the parent fractal of the two 
; most recent FOTD's.  I named the image "The African Veldt".  I 
; can give no reason for the name other than I think it sounds ex-
; citing.  I also might have been thinking of an old story by Ray 
; Bradbury named "The Veldt", which as I recall is about a house 
; with animated walls that depict an African grassland scene.
; 
; I rated today's image at a 6.  Combined with the render time of 
; 4 minutes, this gives an overall value of 142.  The render time 
; can be changed to a faster download time by visiting Paul's FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the finished GIF image has been or soon will be posted.  
; 
; Thursday was quite a pleasant day here at Fractal Central.  The 
; warm sun, light winds and temperature of 56F 13C made conditions 
; near ideal for an afternoon in the yard.  The cats took advan-
; tage of the opportunity.  This morning is starting sunny, but it 
; is colder, and the wind is high.  We'll see what the cats think 
; of this.
; 
; I'll think more of fractal things once I get the work behind me. 
; Until the next FOTD appears, take care, and see you in the land 
; of fractals.
