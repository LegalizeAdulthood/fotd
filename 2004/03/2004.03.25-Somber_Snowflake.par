; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal pictures a quadratic midget.  There is nothing 
; unusual in having a quadratic midget at the center of the 
; screen.  Most of my images have them.  But this midget is 
; strange indeed.  By their nature, quadratic midgets are 
; surrounded by symmetrically spaced elements that continually 
; split in two as they approach the midget.  The first indicator 
; of a midget is the presence of two symmetrical elements that 
; split into four similar but smaller elements.  This splitting 
; continues in the series 2,4,8,16,32... as the elements approach 
; the midget.
; 
; We now can see what is wrong with today's midget, which I have 
; named "Somber Snowflake".  I gave the image this name because 
; the pattern surrounding the midget is shaped quite like a dark 
; snowflake with a green aura.  But snowflakes have six sides, and 
; the number 6 is not part of the 2,4,8,16... series.
; 
; Something has gone wrong.  Some other series has infected the 
; quadratic series, and this infection will become only worse as 
; the exploration of the Z^3+x(Z^4) fractals continues in the days 
; to come.
; 
; Though it is on the dreary side, today's image rates a 6, which 
; is just a little above average.  The render time is a speedy 
; 2-1/2 minutes, which results in an overall value of 233.
; 
; The pre-rendered GIF image is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With sun and a temperature of 61F 16C, Wednesday was a rather 
; pleasant day here at Fractal Central.  Thomas, the oversized 
; orange, spent several hours in the yard.  Tippy, the lean wiry 
; tabby, passed the day sleeping on his window shelf.  Since 
; 14-year-old cats do little but sleep, it was hard to tell if 
; Tippy did not feel good.  In the evening all appeared well when 
; the tuna treat vanished as it should.  This morning is starting 
; with clearing skies and warmer temperatures.  I expect a good 
; day for the duo.
; 
; As for me, being not quite as old on the human scale as the cats 
; are on the cat scale, I still enjoy an occasional bit of the 
; unusual, but it appears it will be another in a seemingly 
; unending stream of normal days, with the exception of a new 
; fractal at the end.  Until tomorrow, take care, and fractals are 
; never boring.
