; FOTD -- March 09, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After a three-day delay, today's image takes us into the 
; oversized fractal that results when unlikely portions of 
; Z^(-1.1) and Z^(-3.1) are combined and (1/C) is added.  The 
; parent fractal is an oversized thing, too large for the most 
; interesting part to fit on the default screen.  But one outzoom 
; reveals two Mandeloids, sitting butt to butt, with their East 
; Valleys connected by a most extraordinary filament.
; 
; I have not yet examined the filament, which I suspect has the 
; same appearance regardless of how deep one looks into it.  What 
; I did examine was the southern shoreline of the East Valley of 
; the western Mandeloid.  A short distance inland I found a 
; network of lacy filaments, spotted with midgets resembling 
; jewels on a string.  The midgets are surrounded by the basic 
; 'East Valley' patterns, but these 'brain-like' patterns are 
; surrounded in turn by most interesting networks of filaments, a 
; good example of which is illustrated in today's image.
; 
; Extending southwest-northeast from the central midget is a 
; lovely network of jeweled filaments like the filament network on 
; which today's image lies.  Extending northwest-southeast from 
; the midget are filaments like those that connect the two large 
; Mandeloids in the parent fractal.  Most likely, in their depths, 
; these filaments simply go on and on forever.
; 
; I named the image "Jeweled Minibrot", which fairly well 
; describes it.  The unlucky-appearing render time of 13 minutes, 
; 13.13 seconds is one of those unlikely statistical coincidences 
; that happen now and then.
; 
; But the image itself is worth a moderately high 7, and those who 
; spend 13 minutes watching it slowly appear on their screens will 
; be lucky indeed.  They will be lucky because most machines now 
; in use are faster than my old P200 unit, and will render the 
; image in far less time.  When the render time is considered, the 
; overall value is 53.
; 
; Those who download the finished GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; will save the most time, but miss some of the fun.
; 
; The greatest weather excitement since the last FOTD came on 
; Saturday afternoon, when an unexpected severe squall struck the 
; harbor and flipped over a water taxi.  Sunday was bright and 
; chilly.  Monday was cold and blustery, with occasional flurries 
; of snow.  The fractal cats did not appreciate the Monday condi-
; tions at all, and showed their disapproval by returning inside 
; only a few minutes after going out.  Today is starting in a 
; similar manner.  We'll see what the cats think of this.
; 
; For me, the greatest amusement so far today came when I opened 
; my e-mail box and found a spam letter with a subject line 
; telling me that the sender had gotten my password and credit-
; card information.  Imagine that -- an honest thief who warns me 
; of his theft and gives me a chance to cancel the card before he 
; uses it.  I wonder what was for sale on the web site the letter 
; directed me to.  The graphic-design work is still heavy, but 
; under control.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and be alert for runaway fractals.
