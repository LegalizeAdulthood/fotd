; FOTD -- March 30, 2004 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To create the parent fractal of today's image, I took Z and 
; added to it a very insignificant 0.0001 part of Z^100.  When the 
; tiny bit of Z^100 turned out to be not so insignificant, I added 
; 0.03 parts more Z to the mixture on a whim.  To complete the 
; mixture, I multiplied the entire thing by 1.1 by setting 
; real(p3) to 0.1.  (I could have done the same thing by changing 
; real(p1) to 1.133, real(p2) to 0.00011, while leaving real(p3) 
; at zero.)  I then began my exploration.
; 
; With these parameters, all the action lies beyond the west 
; border of the default screen, but can easily be found with one 
; outzoom.  I'll not try to describe what lies there, but it does 
; have a tiny East Valley populated by elephants that remind me of 
; the 'Flattop' character of the Dick Tracy comic strip.  Today's 
; scene lies on the southern shore of that valley, in the trunk of 
; one of the flat-topped elephants. 
; 
; There are so many interesting things in today's image that, when 
; I studied it, searching for a name, it reminded me of a congrega-
; tion of fractal features.  I named the image "Congregation" 
; accordingly.  The rating of an 8 might be a bit overblown, but, 
; with its plethora of detail, the image is definitely above 
; average.  The overall value is held down to a 26 by the 1/2-hour 
; render time, but the image is still worth the time spent.
; 
; And as always, those who would rather not spend time rendering 
; images may see the completed image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With more sun than expected and a temperature of 48F 9C, Monday 
; turned out to be a better day than had been forecast by the 
; experts.  The fractal cats, who don't listen to weather reports, 
; were never concerned, and had a quite pleasant afternoon in the 
; yard.  Thomas even worked up enough energy to bat around a few 
; dried-out magnolia leaves.  In the evening, the duo retired 
; without asking for tuna.  Today is starting cloudy and cold.  
; We'll see what happens with the duo.
; 
; For me, it appears today will be un-notable.  But I'll try to 
; find a fractal worthy of at least some note.  My success (or 
; lack thereof) will appear in tomorrow's FOTD.  Until then, take 
; care, and don't go along with the non-fractal crowd.
