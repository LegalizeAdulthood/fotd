; FOTD -- March 23, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is the first glimpse into a new fractal world.  
; This is why I named it "Another New World".  New fractal worlds 
; are no big deal.  They can be created at will.  But the world 
; introduced by today's image is rather unusual, as the next 
; several FOTD's will illustrate.
; 
; On the surface, the image appears to be a routine quadratic 
; midget in the fractal that is created when 0.355 parts of Z^4 
; are added to Z^3 before C is added.  And this is indeed what it 
; is.  But in its heart lies a deep secret, which I will reveal in 
; stages over the days to come.
; 
; For now, enjoy today's image, which is already good enough to 
; rate an above-average 7.  The overall value is brought down to 
; 25.5 by the render time of 27 minutes, but this value can be 
; increased by avoiding the rendering entirely, which can be done 
; by downloading the finished image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a high temperature of 37F 3C and brisk winds, Monday was 
; far too harsh for the delicate paws of the fractal cats.  They 
; did manage an hour or so on the porch, but the clouds that kept 
; obscuring the warm sun gave them no end of annoyance.  Luckily, 
; cats have short memories, and by the time they had finished 
; their evening tuna, they had nearly forgotten their bad day.  
; Today is sunny and warmer, and the wind has died.  The duo is 
; already thinking of going out.
; 
; And I'm thinking of finishing the work that must be done so I 
; can get to the fractals that are fun but not absolutely 
; necessary to survival.  Until the next wonderful image appears 
; 24 hours from now, take care, and see you then.
