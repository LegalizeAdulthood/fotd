; FOTD -- March 20, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image we once again visit the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid, 
; and examine the area just east of the East Valley of the large 
; midget on the negative X-axis.  The large midget cannot be said 
; to lie on the main stem.  There is no main stem in this 
; Mandeloid.  The stem has broken into fractal dust, and as for 
; the large midget -- it has been distorted into a monstrous thing 
; that must be seen to be believed.
; 
; When I say that today's scene is located just east of this 
; monstrous midget's East Valley area, I am not actually speaking 
; correctly.  The midget has no East Valley.  What once was East 
; Valley has broadened into an area that can better be described 
; as East Plateau.  The top of this plateau consists of newly 
; created features that do not exist in the traditional Mandelbrot 
; set.  There are newly created bays and valleys here, with sub-
; features unlike any found in the M-set.
; 
; The strange Julia rectangle lies in this area, along with the 
; figures of overweight people raising their arms in praise of 
; something.  And of course there are midgets.  Today's image 
; illustrates one of the smaller midgets in the area.  Its dis-
; organization is typical of the entire area, and has inspired 
; the name "Discombobulated".
; 
; To add to the interest I rendered the image with the outside set 
; to 'tdis'.  It seems to have worked too well.  The disorganiza-
; tion actually goes a bit too far, spoiling the overall artistic 
; worth and cutting the rating to a merely average 5.  The rather 
; slow render time of over 1/2 hour further cuts the overall value 
; to a lowly but not disgraceful 15.
; 
; For tomorrow's FOTD I might remain in the same area or I might 
; move on.  It all depends on my mood when fractal time arrives 
; this evening.  Meanwhile, up to 1/2 hour of precious time may be 
; saved by visiting Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the completed GIF image from there, thereby 
; avoiding the rendering entirely.
; 
; The weather slowly improved through the day Friday here at 
; Fractal Central, until at 3pm, with full sunlight, the tempera-
; ture reached a high of 48F 9C.  The fractal cats must have 
; approved, for they went outside just after 2pm and did not 
; return indoors until 5pm.  At one time I saw Tippy perched 
; several feet up one of the holly trees, but he climbed down 
; without incident. Today is starting sunny, and it is due to be 
; warmer.  This bodes well for the fractal duo.
; 
; As for me, I've got a bit of work to finish, and then who knows 
; . . . anything could happen.  Until next FOTD, take care, and 
; wait with bated breath . . . you might catch a great fractal.
