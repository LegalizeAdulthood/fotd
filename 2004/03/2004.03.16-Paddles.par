; FOTD -- March 16, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In a recent FOTD I wrote that almost all midgets in fractals 
; created by the MandelbrotMix* series of formulas (formulae for 
; the over-educated) are variations of the quadratic Mandelbrot 
; set.  Note that word 'almost'.  Today's image shows a midget 
; that most definitely is not quadratic, but cubic.  And to top 
; off the strangeness, the midget does not appear to be fully 
; defined, almost as though it were cut in a non-critical plane.  
; The pattern around the midget is perfectly defined however.
; 
; This appearance of an imperfect cubic midget is far from the 
; strangest scene I have stumbled upon in my adventures in fractal 
; land.  I have actually found perfect cubic midgets side-by-side 
; in the same frame with midgets of the 6th order.  A FOTD that 
; appeared several years ago illustrates the scene.  At the 
; moment, the particular image is lost, but I would like to find 
; it for further investigation.
; 
; For some reason, the real(p2) parameter of today's image, which 
; determines the amount of Z^5 to be subtracted from Z^3, is 
; extremely critical, as it is in all fractals that I have so far 
; found which contain higher-order midgets.
; 
; I named the image "Paddles".  The three prominent arms remind me 
; of the paddle blades of an old-fashioned windmill.  (Old-fash-
; ioned always seems to be more picturesque.)  I rated the image 
; at a 6, which is above average, but not outstanding.  When the 
; image's short render time is considered, its overall value comes 
; in at a hefty 357.
; 
; In a recent letter to the fractint list it was asked what I mean 
; by a plane oriented halfway between the Mandelbrot and Julia 
; orientations in the Z^2+C Julibrot.  I am really not sure.  The 
; more I think about it, the less certain I become as to what I 
; mean.  I'll have more to say about this in the next FOTD that 
; uses the Julibrot formula.
; 
; I also recently was asked whether there is such a thing as twin 
; fractals.  I am not sure what the writer means by twin fractals, 
; but there certainly are twin midgets.  A pair of them will 
; appear as tomorrow's FOTD.
; 
; Though today's image is a fast one, the minor annoyance of 
; running the included parameter file can be eliminated by 
; downloading the completed image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The fractal cats, Thomas the lazy oversized orange and Tippy the 
; thin wiry tabby, had one of their best days ever on Monday.  It 
; was one of those days when everything that could go right in the 
; world of cats did go right.  The weather was sunny, with a temp-
; erature of 63F 17C, but the big excitement came when a squirrel 
; came too near Tippy, who appeared to be asleep.  Tippy suddenly 
; lunged and for a moment got his jaws on the squirrel's tail.  
; Luckily for both the squirrel and Tippy, the squirrel pulled 
; free and scampered up a holly tree, where he scolded loudly 
; before going back to his hole.  Thomas actually became alert 
; during the scuffle.  When they came indoors, I treated them to 
; chicken, which they enjoy even more than tuna.
; 
; But today is starting cold and rainy, and the two fractal cats 
; are already turning sulky.  We'll see how it goes.  For me, it 
; looks to be an average day.  And if all goes well, the fractal I 
; find will be above average.
