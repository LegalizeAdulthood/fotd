; FOTD -- March 19, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There is a very unusual rectangle in the Z^(2.003)+C Julibrot.  
; It is located in the Julia set with a C-value of -1.7435 at 
; Z-coordinates of 0.00019,0.07388 and a magnitude of around 75.  
; I have several times mentioned this nearly-perfect rectangle in 
; my FOTD discussions, and since the two most recent FOTD's took 
; me to the general area, I decided to take a peek at the rectan-
; gle while I was there.
; 
; The rectangle is quite critical.  If imag(C) is changed even 
; 0.0001 from zero, the near-perfection is lost.  In today's 
; image, the value is changed only 0.00004 and already strange 
; things are happening.  I aided the strange happenings by 
; rotating the view less than one degree from the exact Julia 
; orientation.
; 
; As a result of my tweaking, the once near-perfect rectangle has 
; been changed into what can be best described as a semaphore 
; flag.  (What ever happened to the days when they actually 
; communicated with those things?)  The lower right half of the 
; rectangle is filled with reddish high-iteration outside stuff, 
; while the upper left half is composed of trapped inside points 
; given life by the 'fmod' inside fill.  Several other inside 
; fills would have worked nearly as well.
; 
; The "SliceJulibrot4" formula that generates today's image is a 
; generalization of the "SliceJulibrot2" formula to any power of 
; Z.  It is a new formula, which I have not previously posted.
; 
; I named the image "Semaphore" and rated it at a 6.  When the 
; render time of 7 minutes is considered, the overall value equals 
; an 82.  Rendering may be avoided entirely by downloading the 
; finished GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Thursday was not too cold and not too cloudy.  It was also not 
; windy, and as a result, the fractal cats had almost two hours of 
; quality time in the yard.  When they came in, they settled down 
; without demanding their usual treat of tuna.  Rain fell during 
; the night, but it has already moved off.  If the clouds move 
; out, the cats will have a fair chance at another good day.
; 
; The work that I must finish is about average.  It's 10:30am and 
; time to get started, so until next FOTD, take care, and be 
; lively.
