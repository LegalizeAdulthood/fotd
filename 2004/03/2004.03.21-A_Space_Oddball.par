; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's adventure in fractal land we return to that 
; rectangle in the Julia set of the Z^(2.003) Julibrot.  But we do 
; one thing very different.  Instead of viewing it in the Julia 
; direction, we turn our viewpoint 90 degrees and view it in the 
; Oblate direction, which is determined by the real(Z) and imag(C) 
; axes.
; 
; Surprisingly, the rectangle is still a rectangle, though it is 
; now quite squashed, and its top and bottom edges are no longer 
; sharply defined, but have become fuzzy.
; 
; When viewed from this direction, the scene has origin symmetry, 
; the lateral elements being transformed into graceful swirls.  
; With few more good features to tell of, the image could be rated 
; no higher than a 5, which, with a 21-minute render time, equals 
; an overall value of 24.
; 
; Perhaps remembering that great film of 35 or so years ago, which 
; was set in a future that is now 3 years in the past, I named the 
; image "A Space Oddball".  And I wonder why none of the things 
; foreseen in that film have come true.  I guess it's a plot of 
; the evil space aliens to keep us helpless in preparation for the 
; coming takeover and enslavememt.  :-)
; 
; The enlightened will avoid the aliens and save 20 minutes by 
; downloading the finished image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Those who enjoy watching their fractals come to life will run 
; the included parameter file.
; 
; The first day of spring turned out to be very pleasant here at 
; Fractal Central on Saturday.  The fractal cats took full 
; advantage of the sun and temperature of 59F 15C by spending most 
; of the afternoon in the yard, checking the spring bulbs that are 
; already showing.  At sunset, they came inside for their evening 
; treat without urging.  Today is starting mostly sunny and mild, 
; but it is quite windy, and the duo dislikes wind, which conceals 
; the sound of danger.  It remains to be seen what kind of day 
; they will have.
; 
; Regardless of the cats' day, my day will be pleasant, and the 
; fractals will all be above average.  Until next time, take care, 
; and hang on to your fractals.  Once you lose them, they are gone 
; forever.
