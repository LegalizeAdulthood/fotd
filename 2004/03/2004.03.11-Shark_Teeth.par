; FOTD -- March 11, 2004 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The FOTD's that rate a 9 are few indeed, but today's image 
; rises, perhaps with a little exaggeration, into that lofty 
; range.  The parent fractal that has been the source of the two 
; most recent FOTD images is the source of today's image also.  
; But instead of being located in the vicinity of the two large 
; Mandeloids, today's image is located in a smaller area of chaos 
; on a filament some distance south of them.  The theme of 
; filaments strung with areas of chaos prevails throughout the 
; parent fractal, particularly so in the area where today's image 
; is found.
; 
; The decorated filaments make fine images when rendered in the 
; traditional manner, but for today's image I wanted something 
; different.  I tried various outside rendering options, some of 
; which worked fairly well, some of which were total failures.  
; Then I evaporated the image by raising its escape radius to 
; one-googol, and rendered the resulting blank screen of totally 
; inside points with the 'bof61' option.  The result was spectac-
; ular indeed.
; 
; A little bit of color tweaking produced today's image, which, at 
; least in my opinion, is the best in quite a while.  I named it 
; "Shark Teeth".  The image does rather resemble strings of shark 
; teeth, with a lovely pink flower at the center.  The rating of 9 
; and the render time of 7 minutes combine for an overall value of 
; 124.
; 
; As always, the minor task of rendering the image from the 
; included parameter file may be avoided by downloading the 
; finished image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A Wednesday morning snow shower here at Fractal Central failed 
; to whiten the ground, but was enough to keep the fractal cats 
; confined to the indoors for the day.  The temperature reached a 
; high of 45F 7C, which changed the snow to rain before it ended.  
; Today is starting much improved.  The cats will be happy.
; 
; As is usually the case with me, I have official business to put 
; behind me before settling down to search for the next fractal.  
; The chance that my search will be successful is 100 percent.  So 
; until 24 hours from now, take care, and some but not all frac-
; tals deserve rave reviews.
