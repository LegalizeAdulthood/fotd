; FOTD -- March 17, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The day started with a bang here at Fractal Central, when I 
; opened my e-mail box and discovered that I had just won 3 
; million-dollar lotteries that I have no memory of entering.  
; Talk about good luck -- it doesn't get any better than this.  
; Now I'll be able to give up working and devote all my time to 
; finding more fractals.   ;-)
; 
; Now on to today's fractal.  I recently was asked if such a thing 
; as twin fractals exists.  I'm not sure about twin fractals, but 
; twin midgets certainly do exist.  A pair of them is illustrated 
; in today's image.
; 
; The twin midgets are located in the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid.  This 
; Mandeloid is part of the Julibrot that holds the near-perfect 
; rectangle that I occasionally distort and use as a FOTD image.  
; The parent Mandeloid is almost indistinguishable from the 
; classic Mandelbrot set, the major difference being found in the 
; area of the main stem, which has split into fractal dust.  
; Today's image is located in this dust.
; 
; Though the midgets in the image are close together, their basins 
; of attraction do not interfere with each other.  A major discon-
; tinuity that lies between them isolates them.  Sometimes, the 
; basins of closely-spaced midgets do overlap, and sometimes the 
; midgets themselves merge, but in these cases, it is always 
; corresponding parts of both midgets that come together.  Two 
; main stems can merge, or two East Valleys, but never an East 
; Valley and a main stem.
; 
; The two large twin midgets in today's image lie in a field of 
; smaller midgets, some of which are quite attractive, surrounded 
; by networks of fractal railroad tracks.  The Julia sets of this 
; area can also be unusually attractive, but that's another story.
; 
; I named today's picture "The Twinship of Twins".  The name 
; doesn't make too much sense, but it has a nice sound to it.  The 
; rating of 4 is just a bit below average.  Combined with the 
; render time of near 4-1/2 minutes, this gives an overall value 
; of 90.
; 
; The rendering may be avoided entirely by downloading the 
; finished image from Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A steady windy rain that fell all day Tuesday here at Fractal 
; Central, and a temperature that never rose above 34F 1C, kept 
; the fractal cats solidly confined to their indoor shelves by the 
; windows.  Their moods were not as bad as might be expected 
; however.  Most likely, as they gazed out at the miserable 
; weather, they were thankful that they were not one of the 
; homeless cats who have no place to go on such miserable days.  
; In the evening I gave them a small treat of tuna as a reward for 
; their good behavior.  Today is starting cloudy and cold, but it 
; is dry.  We shall see how the day goes.
; 
; For me it's just another day with work to be done and fractals 
; to find.  The next fractal will appear here in 24 hours.  Check 
; then for something you have never seen before.  Until 24 hours 
; have passed, take care, and almost all FOTD fractals are things 
; that have never been seen before.
