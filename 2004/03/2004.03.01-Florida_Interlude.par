; FOTD -- March 01, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Recently on the Fractint list I saw an image posted that shows 
; disconnected features in the Julibrot.  The image started me 
; wondering.  It is known that the classic Mandelbrot set is 
; connected, but the perturbed M-sets are not.  And it is known 
; that Julia sets are either connected or disconnected, depending 
; on whether their corresponding Mandelbrot points lie within the 
; M-set itself.  But, to my knowledge, has it ever been determined 
; whether or not the four-dimensional Julibrot is connected?  Does 
; every apparently disconnected point have a filament leading 
; through hyperspace back to the central hyperbay?  I rather 
; suspect that the Julibrot is connected, but this is based on 
; intuition.  I have not seen it proved and I could easily be 
; wrong. . . . Now on to today's image . . .
; 
; To find today's image, I took Z^(-1.2), combined it with 0.2 
; parts of Z^(2.1), then added (1/C).  The resulting fractal 
; consists of a large, distorted Mandeloid with a smaller, discon-
; nected Mandeloid some distance to the east.  To locate the scene 
; of today's action, I checked the East Valley of the larger 
; Mandeloid, which in this case is on the north shore of the main 
; bay.  The scene of today's action lies in the interior of this 
; valley, disconnected from the rest of the fractal.
; 
; As is always the case, the disconnected nature of the general 
; area is reflected in the disconnected nature of the features 
; surrounding the central midget.  The curving, feathery filaments 
; add just enough artistic touch to qualify the image as FOTD for 
; the first day of March.
; 
; I had intended on naming the image "Fractal Interlude", but for 
; some reason I wrote "Florida Interlude".  The mistake seemed as 
; good as my original intent, so I let it stand.  Not much need to 
; be said about the rating of 6, which is the most common FOTD 
; rating.  When adjusted for the render time of 4.07 minutes, the 
; rating jumps to a 98.

; 
; will have little reason to concern themselves with the render 
; time.
; 
; The cats had a near perfect day in the Fractal Central yard on 
; Sunday.  With a temperature of 66F 19C and lots of sun to lounge 
; in, the duo had nothing to do but nothing all day.  And they do 
; nothing very well.  When evening arrived, they came indoors with 
; their tails straight in the air, ready for their dinner.  Today 
; is starting in a similar manner.  Hopefully, things will go just 
; as well for the duo.
; 
; I have a bit of work to clear away before I can declare my day a 
; success.  And the best way to finish a job is to start it.  
; Until the next glorious or not-so-glorious fractal appears, take 
; care, and watch for hit-and-run fractals.
