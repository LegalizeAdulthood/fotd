; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image things start to go wrong.  The midget at the 
; center is clearly of the quadratic variety, as are almost all 
; midgets in fractals created by the MandelbrotMix* series of 
; formulae.  But the expected 2-4-8-16... series of elements 
; leading toward the midget is not as well defined as it might be. 
; The confusion is just starting to appear, but it is there, and 
; from here on, the confusion will only increase.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is virtually the same as the 
; parent of yesterday's image -- a seemingly harmless mixture of 
; Z^3 and Z^4 that would be expected to do little but create a 
; routine combination fractal.  In the world of fractals however, 
; surprises are common, which is why I find fractals so fascina-
; ting.  The surprises coming in the next few days are some of the 
; greatest I have yet stumbled upon.
; 
; I have named today's image "X-Y Mandel Fractal".  Something 
; about the image reminds me of pictures I have seen of the X and 
; Y chromosomes that determine an individual's sex.  I believe all 
; individuals start as women, but half are mutated into men by an 
; X-Y chromosome.  If this is true, then half the population of 
; earth consists of alien mutants bent on death and destruction.
; 
; After watching the news, I guess it's true!
; 
; Before getting sidetracked into politics, an ever-present 
; danger, I must get back on the fractal track and admit that I 
; could rate today's image no higher than an average 5.  When the 
; render time of 4 minutes is taken into consideration, the 
; overall value jumps to 118.
; 
; The best value of all is to download the GIF image file from the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A warmer temperature of 48F 9C, lots of sun, and lighter winds 
; gave the fractal cats a pleasant afternoon in the yard here at 
; Fractal Central on Tuesday.  Today is starting still warmer, but 
; with clouds moving in, the duo might not be as happy.
; 
; For me, it looks like another routine day of getting the work 
; finished, then exploring in Fractal Land.  So until next time, 
; take care, and good fractals make unhappy cows give more milk.
