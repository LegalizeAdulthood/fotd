; FOTD -- December 29, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To find today's image I checked the Z^(1.98)+C Mandeloid 3.1 
; levels up the logarithmic spiral.  The parent fractal is a 
; distorted Mandelbrot set with numerous splits along the negative 
; real axis.  Today's scene is located in a distorted valley of a 
; large bud on the northwest shoreline of the main bay.
; 
; For some reason now forgotten, I named the extremely busy image 
; "Verdancy".  The name is not really deserved, as the image has 
; little resemblance to a lush forest.  In fact, it is such a 
; mish-mash of assorted and not-always-harmonious colors that I 
; could rate it at only a 4.  The not-exactly-fast render time of 
; over 17 minutes raises this to a humble 23.  But all is not 
; lost, for the image has been pre-rendered and posted on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; from where it may safely be downloaded.
; 
; <The philosophical part of this discussion has been omitted from 
; the Fractint version, but it appears in the philofractal version.>
; 
; Tuesday was chilly here at Fractal Central, but not as chilly as 
; Monday had been.  The high temperature of 36F 2C was just warm 
; enough for the fractal duo to venture off the porch and spend 
; over an hour checking the holly thicket.  When they found 
; nothing out of order, they returned inside to enjoy their treat 
; of tuna.  Today is starting notably milder.  It should be a fine 
; day for the duo.
; 
; I continue to be asked if and when pictures of the dynamic duo 
; of fractal cats will be posted.  The problem is that my 25-year-
; old Pentax SLR film camera has stopped working and I have not 
; found an opportunity, nor a good-enough reason, to purchase and 
; learn to operate one of the 'new-fangled' electronic cameras.  
; But one of these days I will do so, and the cats' pictures will 
; be available for all the world to see.
; 
; For me it looks like work for most of the day, then a trip 
; to the land of fractals, where I will linger awhile to ponder 
; deep philosophical things not necessarily designed to make 
; people feel good.  The image I find there will appear as 
; tomorrow's FOTD.  The thoughts will appear in the philofractal 
; discussion.  Until then, take care, and never stop searching.
