; FOTD -- December 10, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Strange things are happening in a certain East Valley.  We have 
; always known that elephants lurk there, but what has happened in 
; the East Valley of the midget that appeared in yesterday's image?
; 
; Today's image is a blow-up of that valley.  The valley itself 
; enters the frame at center right.  But it never terminates.  
; Instead of coming to the expected sharp point, the valley smears 
; out and breaks apart into a comb-like series of sub-valleys that 
; appear to be converging on a point near the center left of the 
; frame.  They would reach the point if I had given them enough 
; iterations.
; 
; There also appears to be a bud of some sort partially hidden 
; beneath the comb-valleys.  Unfortunately, even the maxiter of 
; 16000 falls far short of fully defining this vague feature.
; 
; The unusually smooth coloring is a result of the convoluted 
; boundaries of the iteration bands, which reflect the East Valley 
; character of the part of the midget in which they exist.
; 
; The name "The New East" does not refer to an emerging third-
; world country in the Eastern Hemisphere.  It tells that such a 
; scene in the East Valley area of a midget is new.  (At least I 
; have never before observed such a scene.)
; 
; The rating of a 6 is a bit above average.  It's not really a 
; great image, and much of its impact is due to the color map I 
; gave it.  Unfortunately, it is a very slow image, mostly due to 
; the necessity of turning off the periodicity checking when using 
; the HyperMandelbrot formula.  As a result, the overall worth 
; comes in at a paltry 6-1/2.  But relief can be found on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image, which I sent on ahead, is waiting for download.
; 
; Morning clouds led to steady afternoon rain here at Fractal 
; Central on Thursday.  The fractal cats had no time at all out-
; side, which left them quite testy.  Luckily, the frequent treats 
; of tuna and turkey kept their sullen moods within bearability.  
; This morning is starting cloudy and wet.  It looks like another 
; bad day for the duo.
; 
; I managed to clear out the unexpected job by mid-afternoon on 
; Thursday, leaving time enough to find today's fractal.  (Since 
; the image is a blow-up of a part of yesterday's fractal, the 
; search was not a difficult one.)  The rest of today looks to be 
; on the slow side, which can only mean a good fractal for the 
; next FOTD.  Until that time arrives, take care, and I am, there-
; fore I think.
