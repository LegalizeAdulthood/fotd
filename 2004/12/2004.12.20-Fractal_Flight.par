; FOTD -- December 20, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's fractal we break out the MandelbrotBC2 formula, 
; which takes advantage of the multi-valued nature of the complex 
; 'log' function, and gets an infinity of fractals from formulas 
; that would seem limited to only one.
; 
; The additional fractals are especially interesting when the 
; exponent of Z is set to a value between 1 and 2.  Today's image 
; uses a value of 1.1 -- a value in the lower part of that range, 
; where the images explode in size as we travel up the logarithmic 
; spiral and the changes are the greatest.
; 
; The parent fractal is an oversized thing resembling a dead bird 
; lying on its back, with its pointed bill facing upward.  Today's 
; scene is located in the valley that forms the lower edge of the 
; bird's bill.  Not wanting to make allusions to a dead bird in 
; the name of the image, I decided to name it "Fractal Flight".
; 
; The question of whether fractals can fly is moot.  Fractals are 
; abstractions, and abstractions can do anything we wish them to,
; though usually they do nothing.
;   
; In today's image I saw a flight of fractal somethings taking off 
; into a blue sky and vanishing beyond the upper left corner of 
; the frame.  Perhaps they have been frightened by approaching 
; danger.  (It is hard to imagine how a fractal could come to harm 
; however.)
; 
; The 'objects' (if that's what they are) share a curious similar-
; ity.  In some ways they are alike; in other ways, each has a 
; character of its own.  Even the larger groups of objects share 
; this partial similarity.  The image is a true fractal.  In it, 
; the same pattern is repeated again and again at the deeper 
; levels.  Of course, the deeper we explore, the slower the calcu-
; lation becomes.
; 
; With nothing really exceptional to raise its rating, the scene 
; could be rated no higher than an average 5.  Its render time of 
; almost 23 minutes gives it an overall worth of only 22.  It is 
; still an interesting image to see however, and well worth the 
; small effort of downloading it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy clouds, a chilly temperature of 36F 2C, and a cold rain 
; kept the duo indoors for the entire day on Sunday.  Their moods 
; were surprisingly good considering their confinement.  As night 
; fell, the rain changed to snow, which soon froze solid, making 
; for tricky walking and worse driving.  When the duo saw the bad 
; conditions, they actually seemed glad to be indoors, where a 
; generous serving of tuna was available to assure their content-
; ment.  This morning is starting sunny, but with a temperature of 
; only +7F -14C and a wind of 20mph 30kph, I doubt that the duo 
; will want to go outside.
; 
; The work is still heavy in my department, but I hope to squeeze 
; in a fractal or two before the day ends.  The best of what I 
; find will appear as tomorrow's FOTD.  Until then, take care, and 
; keep your cool when the snow falls.
