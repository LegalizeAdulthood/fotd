; FOTD -- December 09, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'm in a bit of a rush this morning, stuck with an unexpected 
; large job and a customer who needs it sooner than immediately.  
; So today's discussion is brief and late.
; 
; Today, we continue studying the 'HyperMandelbrot' formula, which 
; draws slices of the Mandelbrot figure created by 4-part hypercom-
; plex numbers.  In Mandel-type fractals, the distortions of the 
; midgets often mirrors that of the parent fractal.  While explor-
; ing the HyperMandelbrot fractal yesterday, I wondered if the cor-
; responding distortions were true of this fractal also.  I found 
; that it is partly true.  The midget in today's image does not 
; show the appearance of its parent, the parent is a perfect 
; Mandelbrot set, but it does show what will happen to the parent 
; fractal when the parameter values are farther removed from zero.
; 
; The midget's plight also makes a rather striking image, aided in 
; a large degree by manipulation of the colors on my part.  The de-
; tail on the inside of the midget is not inside stuff made visible 
; by an active inside fill.  It is true high-iteration outside 
; stuff, and can be zoomed in on like any other 'outside' feature.
; 
; I named the little midget "Junior", and the image, "Hyperbrot 
; Junior."  The rating of 7 means I consider the image to be above 
; average.  The render time of 8 minutes gives the picture an 
; overall worth of 86 -- not bad for a picture of a typical midget 
; lying in Seahorse Valley.
; 
; All this may be seen by running the included parameter file, or 
; by downloading the finished GIF image from:

; 
; The Wednesday weather was absolutely perfect here at Fractal 
; Central, with warm sun, moderating winds, and a temperature of 
; 61F 16C.  Needless to say, the cats were ecstatic.  In fact, it 
; took a surprise serving of tuna to lure them back inside when 
; the sun went down.  But this morning is starting cloudy, with a 
; forecast of rain.  Things do not look good for the dynamic duo.
; 
; For me it's more of the usual.  The next fractal will appear in 
; 24 hours.  Until that hallowed moment arrives, take care, and be 
; at ease.
