; FOTD -- December 04, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's not-so-glorious image was created by the 'tetrate' 
; formula, a formula even more simple (if possible) than the 
; Mandelbrot formula.  The iterated expression is simply C^Z, but 
; even this simple expression creates a fractal.
; 
; The fractals it creates consist mostly of large flat blocks, so 
; to add interest I rendered today's image with the inside set to 
; 'atan' and the outside set to 'real'.  In the resulting fractal 
; I found a scene that vaguely reminded me of the top part of a 
; helmet or ceremonial headdress peeking over a hill.  Since the 
; bottom of the helmet, along with the head wearing it, is 
; hidden, I named the picture "Hidden Helmet".
; 
; There is really nothing in the image that could be rated above 
; average.  The mathematical interest is lacking, the coloring is 
; smooth but unexceptional, the composition is nothing out of the 
; ordinary.  The rating of 5 is as good as I could do with the 
; image.  Luckily, the calculation time of a brief 1-1/2 minutes 
; means that not much time will be spent rendering it.  The 
; overall worth is 314.
; 
; The rendering can be avoided entirely by downloading the image 
; from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Mostly sunny but cold weather here at Fractal Central on Friday, 
; with a temperature of 46F 8C, limited the fractal cats' outdoor 
; time to under an hour -- not nearly enough to keep them conten-
; ted.  An extra treat of tuna was needed to make up for the yard 
; time they missed.  Today is starting much the same.  More tuna 
; may be needed before the day ends.
; 
; I expect a relatively calm day -- that is unless something unex-
; pected happens.  Until the next FOTD fractal appears here in 24 
; hours, take care, and try to prove that the world is real.  If 
; you fail, try to prove that it is unreal.
