; FOTD -- December 23, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's that time of year again, and I find myself with so much 
; work and so many things to do that I will have no spare time for 
; the FOTD for the next 3 or 4 days.  The bad news is that there 
; will be no FOTD until December 27th or 28th.  The good news is 
; that the FOTD will return at that time in its full glory, for 
; another year, or twenty-five years, of stunning fractal images 
; from nowhere.
; 
; With today's image, I stayed with the Z^(2.02)+C fractal, but 
; examined it 154 turns up the hyper-spiral, where the figure is 
; rotated 180 degrees, so that East Valley now lies on the nega-
; tive X-axis, where the most interesting discontinuities are 
; located.
; 
; The inner details of this area are like nothing in the classic 
; M-set.  They vaguely resemble the elephant-like shapes that 
; might be expected there, but are far more broken and chaotic.  
; The midget in today's image is a typical example of the dis-
; order that exists in this part of the infinite-dimensional 
; land of fractals.
; 
; I have named the image "Comb Filter" because some of the ele-
; ments resemble coarse-toothed combs.  (I am in no way an elec-
; tronics technician.)  The rating of a 7 seems fair, considering 
; the unusual nature of the image, which needed no program trick-
; ery.  The render time of just under 5 minutes raises the overall 
; worth to a rather impressive 143.
; 
; The most convenient way to see the image is to download it from 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; An absolutely gorgeous day on Wednesday here at Fractal Central 
; resulted in angelic cats.  The warm sun, light breezes, and 
; temperature of 61F 16F were just what the duo needed to ease 
; their disappointment over the recent cold spell.  No tuna was 
; necessary to make them happy in the evening.  Today is starting 
; mild but rainy.  I hope the duo doesn't have too big a let-down.
; 
; For me, it's finish the work then get ready for the holiday 
; craziness.  As I said earlier, the next FOTD will appear in 5 
; days on December 28, (maybe the 27th if things go well).  Until 
; then, take care, and may Santa leave a real fractal, not just a 
; picture of one, in your stocking.
