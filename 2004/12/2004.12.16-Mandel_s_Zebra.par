; FOTD -- December 16, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The HyperMandelbrot formula seems to be running out of steam, or 
; maybe it is me who finds himself faced with another oversized 
; pile of real work, but whatever, I could rate today's image no 
; higher than a 4.
; 
; The scene pictured is that of a midget in the northwest quadrant 
; of the M-set that has been filled in with what looks to me like 
; zebra stripes.  I produced the zebra stripes by entering an 
; infinitesimal value as real(p3).  This value is the square root 
; of one-googol, and common sense says that it should have no visi-
; ble effect on the image.  But in this case, as with relativity 
; and quantum things, common sense leads to the wrong conclusion.  
; (Could there be a cosmic connection here, or is the overworked 
; math routine producing artifacts?)
; 
; Like other hyper images, today's image makes little sense.  I can 
; see no apparent reason for the number of stripes in the various 
; features of the midget.  It probably has something to do with the 
; iteration cycles, but if so, the relation is vague.
; 
; I named the image "Mandel's Zebra" for obvious reasons.  When 
; adjusted for the render time of a little over 12 minutes, the 
; rating of 4 gives the image an overall worth of 33 -- not great 
; but not disgraceful either.
; 
; All this rating stuff may be done away with by downloading the 
; finished image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; It was too cold on Wednesday for the fractal cats to stay 
; outdoors more than 15 minutes.  A temperature of 36F 2C might 
; not seem like extreme cold to some, but the aging cats demand 
; temperatures around 60F 15C before they can be comfortable.  
; Needless to say, they got much evening tuna.  This morning is 
; starting with a temperature of 19F -7C.  It does not look good 
; for the duo.
; 
; For me, it's a lot of work waiting to be done.  I will try to 
; have the next FOTD ready by post time tomorrow.  If not, I'll 
; post my alibi.  Until then, take care, and search for the light 
; in the night.
