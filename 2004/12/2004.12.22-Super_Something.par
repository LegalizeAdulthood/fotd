; FOTD -- December 22, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's fractal we take a trip to the Z^(2.02)+C fractal.  We 
; check it 20 levels up the logarithmic hyper-spiral.  (Actually 
; the scene lies 16.858... levels up the spiral.  The level 
; 3.14159... or 'pi' is better considered ground level.)  The 
; formula is very close to that of the Mandelbrot set, and the 
; fractal it produces is very similar.  But there are significant 
; differences.  To start, the entire set appears rotated 30 
; degrees.  The greatest change however has taken place at the 
; north branch of Seahorse Valley, which has broadened into a 
; plateau with a spire at its inner edge.  Today's scene lies on 
; the main-bay side of this spire.
; 
; The midget I found there rates a lofty 7.  I have never before 
; seen a midget with such intricate decoration surrounding it 
; unless it was produced by one of the fancy features of the 
; program, which I feel are somewhat artificial.  By contrast, 
; today's scene, which was rendered with the outside set to the 
; standard 'iter', shows what is 'actually there'.  I named the 
; image "Super Something", leaving it to the viewer to decide what 
; that 'something' is.
; 
; Since the exponent of Z is fractional, discontinuities must 
; exist in the image, and indeed they are there.  But with an 
; exponent so close to integer value, the breaks are minor, and 
; at first glance may go un-noticed.
; 
; The rating of a 7 leaps to an overall worth of a rather 
; disappointing 47 when the render time of almost 15 minutes is 
; figured in.  But the rendering may be eliminated entirely by 
; downloading the finished image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a peak temperature of 39F 3C, Tuesday was hardly balmy here 
; at Fractal Central.  But the dynamic cats, who had been confined 
; indoors for almost two days, were willing to ignore the minor 
; chill to enjoy an outing in the great outdoors of the holly 
; thicket, where they passed the afternoon pretending they were 
; stalking birds.  Only a minor treat of tuna was needed to end 
; their day on an up note.  This morning is starting sunny and 
; warmer, but rain is scheduled to move in before nightfall.  
; I see a hint of trouble for the fractal duo.
; 
; For me, the pile of real work waiting to be done is minor.  This 
; should assure another fine fractal in 24 hours, and maybe 
; another outburst of philosophy.  Until then, take care, and 
; remember that, regardless of how much we learn, we will never 
; know more than an infinitesimal part of all there is to know.
