; FOTD -- December 15, 2004 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I was thinking of returning to the MandelbrotMix4 formula for 
; today's fractal, but before I did, I decided to have another go 
; at the HyperMandelbrot formula.  In the end, I was glad I did.
; 
; I found today's curious circular object at the center of a small 
; bud on the southern shore of East Valley of the M-set.  It is 
; unlike anything that I know of in the classic Mandelbrot or 
; Julia sets, which is why I named it "A New Dance".
; 
; It is not surprising that the HyperMandelbrot set should hold 
; new and unsuspected features.  After all, the hyper-set is 
; actually a 4-dimensional thing, with unlimited angles at which 
; to cut 2-dimensional slices.  Unfortunately, these slices will 
; necessarily miss most of the HyperMandelbrot set.  The most they 
; can give in a single image is a vague idea of the richness that 
; actually exists.
; 
; When a 2-D slice passes close to an attracting element of the 
; HyperM-set, the slice will be distorted by that element, giving 
; the impression of a heavy cloth draped over what lies beneath.  
; Today's image is composed mostly of such distortions.  Many of 
; the features in the hyper-vicinity are not in the image, but 
; merely close to it, and those that pass through it, do so only 
; coincidentally.
; 
; Because it illustrates some truly new features, I rated today's 
; image at a 7.  It could just as easily have been rated at an 8.  
; I was feeling conservative when I decided on the rating.  When 
; adjusted for the render time of 3-1/2 minutes, the rating adds 
; up to an overall worth of 200.
; 
; The image is available, already rendered, on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Brisk winds and a temperature of 39F 4C kept the fractal cats 
; safely indoors on Tuesday.  The duo actually seems to realize 
; that winter has arrived, and there will be few pleasant outside 
; days for the next few months.  An extra serving of tuna assured 
; their good moods.  Today is starting sunny but even colder.  And 
; a few flurries of snow fell during the night.  I hope the duo is 
; as adjusted to indoor life as they seem.
; 
; For me it looks like a day with an average amount of work.  This 
; means an early afternoon finish and several hours for fractals, 
; the next of which will appear right here in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and how many Mandelbrot sets could fit on the 
; head of a pin?
