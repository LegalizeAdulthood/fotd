; FOTD -- December 12, 2004 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The HyperMandelbrot formula continues to amaze me.
; 
; Todays image shows the same midget that appeared in the FOTD for 
; December 9, the 'Hyperbrot Junior' fractal.  Or perhaps I should 
; say it shows the area where the 'junior' once existed.  The mid-
; get itself has basically vanished, leaving behind only a tangle 
; of twisting tendrils.  I named these leftovers "The Craziest 
; Midget" because they show the craziest thing to happen to a 
; midget that I have ever come upon.
; 
; To begin the craziness, check your assumption that there are 16 
; partially overlapping tendrils leading toward the remains of the 
; midget.  Count them and you will find only 14.  (I have no idea 
; what happened to the other two, but most likely the 14 tendrils 
; are a reflection of a period-14 iteration cycle.)
; 
; To continue the craziness, look at what once was a perfect 
; minibrot midget.  I admit that we are not seeing it sliced in a 
; critical plane, but who ever saw a non-critical midget fill with 
; tendrils and change into almost a delicate flower.  Midgets 
; simply erode away in an irregular and not particularly attrac-
; tive manner when we slice them farther from the critical plane.  
; But then, this is a 'hyper' Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The image changes dramatically as the real(p2) parameter is 
; slightly changed.  And the remains of the midget also hold their 
; position on the screen, making the scene a good candidate for a 
; short animation.  
; 
; I used no fancy program features to create the image, only the 
; standard equal-iteration bands with the inside set to black.  
; The rating of an 8 reflects my surprise at seeing what happened 
; to the midget as well as my opinion of the artistic merit of the 
; image.  When the 15-minute render time is taken into considera-
; tion, the overall worth registers a nominal 52.  To see the 
; curious midget, run the included parameter file or download the 
; image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The rain ended at noon here at Fractal Central on Saturday, but 
; the clouds hung on for most of the afternoon, and the tempera-
; ture reached only 52F 11C.  When the wind arose, the fractal 
; cats decided that they had had enough, and hurried back inside 
; to get warm and enjoy their tuna.  This morning is starting 
; partly cloudy and chilly. The cats will likely find some fault 
; with the day.
; 
; For me the day looks slow, which is how I am learning to like 
; it.  Lots of spare time means lots of time for fractals, the 
; next of which will appear right here in only 24 hours.  Until 
; then, tale care, and watch the fractals grow.
