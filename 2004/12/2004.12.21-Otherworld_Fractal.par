; FOTD -- December 21, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; WARNING -- I went beyond the topic in today's discussion, as I 
; occasionally do.  The discussion is rambling and rather philo-
; sophical.  Those who have a 'knee-jerk' reaction to philosophy 
; or mysticism should move on directly to the image and spare 
; their knees.
; 
; Depending on where the observer is located, today is either the 
; shortest or longest day of the year.  For those living on the 
; equator however, where all days are 12 hours long, it is just 
; another 12-hour day, though it is still one of the two days of 
; the year with the lowest maximum sun angle.
; 
; On a special astronomical day such as today, fractals are just 
; as real or unreal as on any other day.  The position of the sun 
; has no connection to the world of fractals.  This much everyone 
; can agree on.  But do other universes exist where such a 
; connection might be possible?  After all, the name of today's 
; image is "Otherworld Fractal", and I gave it this name because 
; it is unlike anything that might be seen in our familiar version 
; of the 'real' world.
; 
; In the naive days of my youth, I was certain that there is only 
; one real world and that world was the one I had learned to con-
; struct from the images I observed through my senses.  Those who 
; thought otherwise were confused and superstitious.  True, I 
; realized that my senses could detect only a tiny part of that 
; real world, but there was still only one real outer world, and 
; that world was the ultimate reality, which was out there whether 
; anyone was around to observe it or not.
; 
; That was when I was young and naive.
; 
; I am no longer young, though I am still rather naive, (aren't we 
; all), but I am not so naive as to believe that anything such as 
; an ultimate reality can exist unless one is referring to the 
; idea known as God.  When one truly knows God, all questions 
; about creation and existence become non-questions.  When one 
; asks why God created the universe, or where God came from, or 
; even what happens to people after they die, then that person 
; does not truly know the nature of reality.
; 
; When one asks, or even wonders about such things, that person is 
; displaying his ignorance about both himself and the world he 
; assumes he exists in.  When one flees from such questions into 
; the comfortable and easy-to-comprehend world of Atheism, that 
; person is merely showing the arrogance that conceals his fear of 
; the unknown.  I know this because I was once there.  When one 
; realizes that God is an idea, yet uses this fact as evidence 
; that there is no God, that person is closer to the truth.  When 
; one realizes that the physical universe is also an idea, that 
; person is closer still. . . .
; 
; . . . to be continued . . . perhaps . . .
; 
; Just imagine it -- all this off-topic stuff came about because I 
; had the thought that today's image is a scene that could never 
; be observed anywhere in the universe as we know it.  But it very 
; easily could exist in the world of fractals, especially the 
; world created by the formula Z^(1.1)+C.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is about what the image is worth.  Its overall 
; value could be anything, but calculates at a 90.  The most 
; convenient way to see the otherworldly image is to download it 
; from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a temperature of only 19F -7C, Monday was far too cold here 
; at Fractal Central for the dynamic duo to go outside.  But they 
; spent several hours on their shelf by the window, watching the 
; chilled starlings huddle around openings of the neighborhood 
; chimneys to keep warm.  A surprisingly small serving of tuna was 
; needed in the evening to make the duo happy.  This morning is 
; starting less cold, but still far from warm.  We'll see how the 
; duo adjusts.
; 
; For me it looks like another in the nearly endless string of 
; similar days of work before fractals.  The next FOTD will appear 
; right here in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be of good 
; cheer at this time of year.  Save the mysteries for next year.
