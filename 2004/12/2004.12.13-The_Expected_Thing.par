; FOTD -- December 13, 2004 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'm a bit behind in the real work today, so the discussion will 
; be short.  Today's image shows what happens to a sub-midget on a 
; filament of the large midget at -1.75,0 of the M-set when the 
; real(p3) parameter is changed very slightly from 0,0.  The 
; result is two midgets that are seen partially overlapping -- 
; just what would be expected, which is why I named the image "The 
; Expected Thing".  The fiery red colors have no special signifi-
; cance.  The color palette is simply the one that I happened to 
; find first.
; 
; The 'expected thing' is worth a rating of no more than 4, but 
; the render time of just over 2 minutes raises the overall worth 
; to a respectable 167.  The image may be seen by running the 
; attached parameter file or by downloading it from the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Partly cloudy skies and chill, 48F 9C, winds kept the cats snug 
; indoors for all but a brief 20 minutes here at Fractal Central 
; on Sunday.  They seemed to understand that I was not respons-
; ible, and were in surprisingly good moods.  I gave them extra 
; tuna as a reward.  Today is starting sunny, but the chill winds 
; are still blowing, and even colder air is on the way.  The cats' 
; moods will once again be tested.
; 
; For me, the work is rather heavy, but well within the range of 
; being finished in time for tomorrow's fractal, which will likely 
; be a return to the MandelbrotMix4 formula, one that I have not 
; used in over 2 months.  Until then, take care, and conspire with 
; fractals, but don't get caught doing it.  A fractal is hard to 
; keep in jail.
