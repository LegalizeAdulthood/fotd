; FOTD -- December 08, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After more than two months' travel, we have finally completed 
; the tour of the built-in escape-time formulas.  But we have not 
; even dented the surface of the library of formulas that have 
; been written by the Fractint users over the years.  This 
; collection is far too vast for me to explore before the 22nd 
; century arrives.  In fact, I doubt that I could explore even my 
; own formulas in that time.
; 
; We turn today to the HyperMandelbrot formula, which I wrote 
; several years ago but have never intensively explored.  My 
; interest in this formula became re-kindled when I posted the 
; FOTD created by the 'hypercomplex' formula of Fractint, and 
; remembered the limitations of that formula.  My formula adds 
; four additional changeable parameters, and can draw far more 
; interesting images.  But everything it draws is based on the 
; familiar Mandelbrot set that we know and love.
; 
; When I first saw some of the images drawn by my formula, I 
; wondered if they were mere artifacts.  The image changes were 
; too great for very small changes of the parameters.  But then I 
; remembered the Z^2+C Julia sets, and how very small parameter 
; changes can sometimes result in very large image changes.  When 
; the questionable features proved stable under magnification, I 
; decided they are true parts of the Hypercomplex Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The default image drawn by the formula when all parameters are 
; set to zero is the Mandelbrot set.  Today's image shows what 
; happens to the M-set when only two parameters are changed by a 
; small amount.  The set appears to be closing in on itself, the 
; valleys joining into bridge complexes.  I have named the image 
; "Theme and Variations".  The Mandelbrot set is the theme; the 
; images posted in the next week or so will be the variations.
; 
; To me, the most interesting part of today's image lies in the 
; area of Seahorse Valley and the north bud.  The Seahorse Valley 
; has blossomed into an incredible complex of interlinked valleys, 
; while the north bud has collapsed into a kind of M-set with two 
; feathers in its tail.  The inner details of both these areas are 
; unlike anything to be found in the familiar M-set.
; 
; I have rated the image at a 5, which equals average.  It can be 
; no more than average because I have done nothing with the parent 
; fractal but enlagre it.  Over the next few days I will post 
; several additional curious slices of the hyper-M-set drawn by 
; today's formula.  These will likely be average also.  Then I will 
; search for the interesting inner details that might lie hidden in 
; the images I have posted.  These could well rate higher, as the 
; 4-D M-set appears far richer than the familiar 2-D set.
; 
; Because the periodicity must be turned off for the HyperMandel-
; brot formula to work correctly, the render times of images drawn 
; by the formula are rather slow.  But today's image, being of 
; such a low magnitude, is quite fast.  The render time of 37 
; seconds joins with the rating of 5 to give an overall worth of 
; an outstanding 814.  And the image can always be downloaded from 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; though this will take a bit more time than the rendering.
; 
; Rain, fog, and a chilly temperature of 46F 8C kept the fractal 
; cats indoors all day Tuesday.  A good bit of tuna was expended 
; in the evening as a result.  This morning is milder and the sky 
; is clearing, but the wind is up, and fractal cats do not like 
; wind, which conceals the sound of intruding cats.  Hopefully, if 
; the wind abates this afternoon as scheduled, the cats will have 
; enough time in the yard to keep them happy.
; 
; For me its work before fractals.  The next variation on the 
; Mandelbrot set will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and may the best happen.
