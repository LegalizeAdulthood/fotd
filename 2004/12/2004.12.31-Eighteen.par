; 
; FOTD -- December 31, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the fractal world that results when 
; various portions of Z^(-0.8) and Z^(1.4) are combined and (1/C) 
; is added.  I say the fractal world because the formula does not 
; produce a single fractal.  It produces an entire world of 
; smaller individual fractals.
; 
; Though the number of tiny fractals in today's world is infinite, 
; there are two main Mandeloid fractals, surounded by considerable 
; debris.  Today's scene is near the point where the sprawling 
; debris surrounding the large Mandeloid on the left bleeds into 
; the Mandeloid on the right, which is surrounded by less fractal 
; debris.
; 
; To add a little extra sparkle to the image, I rendered it with 
; the outside set to 'real'.  The additional sparkle was enough to 
; raise its rating to a respectable 6.  When the render time of 
; near 7-1/2 minutes is figured in, the overall worth registers an 
; 81.  The name I gave today's FOTD is "Eighteen", a name that has 
; no relation whatsoever to the image.  I chose the name because I 
; was in an ambiguous mood at the time.
; 
; The small task of rendering the image from the included 
; parameter file may be avoided by downloading the finished GIF 
; image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Due to another of those unexpected-work rushes, I have no time 
; to philosophize today.  But the philosophy will return, more 
; intense than ever, in the philofractal version of tomorrow's 
; FOTD discussion.
; 
; The high temperature of 48F 9C and total lack of sun here at 
; Fractal Central on Thursday made it a bit too chilly for the 
; fractal duo to fully enjoy their time outdoors.  They came 
; inside in bad moods after only an hour in the yard, and demanded 
; extra tuna, which, knowing the alternative, I gave them at once. 
; The tuna did the trick, and they settled down side by side on 
; the couch for a long nap.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy again, but it is supposed to turn sunny 
; and warmer by afternoon.  (I'll believe it when I see it.)  
; While waiting for the sun to appear, I'll finish the small bit 
; of work waiting to be done, then set out for fractal land to see 
; what lies there.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and be stoical.
