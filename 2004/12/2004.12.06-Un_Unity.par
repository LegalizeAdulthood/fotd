; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's formula is not strictly an escape-time formula, but the 
; type of image it draws (it draws only one image) is close enough 
; to escape-time images to be included in the Fractint tour.
; 
; We learned in high school that the graph of X^2+Y^2 is a circle, 
; but we never learned that it could be a fractal.  (At least I 
; didn't)  As today's image shows, X^2+Y^2 makes a striking 
; fractal.  All that is necessary to bring out the latent fractal 
; is to make the journey to unity a bit difficult, as has been 
; done in the 'unity' formula.  (An interested fractalist is also 
; a help.)
; 
; The fractal is a strange one.  Features that are clear on the 
; surface vanish mysteriously as we zoom in on them.  When today's 
; image is rendered at a resolution of 640x480, there is an 
; obvious but very narrow circle of radius 1 around the origin.  
; At a resolution of 800x600 only a few scattered traces of this 
; circle are visible.  And when we try to zoom in on the circle, 
; it vanishes completely.  It is not only this delicate circle 
; that vanishes when it is enlarged; nearly every feature in the 
; interior of the circular fractal itself is unstable, almost as 
; though the entire fractal were a moire pattern.
; 
; Today's image shows the entire unity fractal rotated -135 
; degrees.  By setting the outside to 'atan' and turning on the 
; 'decomp' feature, I was able to divide the fractal into two 
; contrasting semi-circles and come up with an image worthy of 
; FOTD status.  The name "Un-Unity" implies that the two halves of 
; the image are so different as to be separate entities.
; 
; The image is extremely fast, rendering in less than 6 seconds on 
; my 7-year-old machine.  Since the 'unity' formula has no parame-
; ters to tweak, and the fractal is unstable when it is zoomed 
; into, I could take no credit for finding a great image.  But 
; today's FOTD is a fine rendering of the basic fractal, well 
; worth the rating of an average 5 that I gave it.  And when the 
; hyper-fast render time is considered, the overall worth measures 
; an astounding 5102.
; 
; Of course, such numbers are meaningless.  All fractals that 
; complete in less that a minute should be considered 'instant' 
; fractals.
; 
; Today's fractal can be seen by running the included parameter 
; file or by downloading it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The warm sun continued all afternoon here at Fractal Central on 
; Sunday, while the temperature reached a mild 54F 12C, giving the 
; fractal cats all the time they wanted in the yard.  It was one 
; of the best days in the past several weeks.  The day was so good 
; in fact that no special treat was needed to keep the duo happy 
; in the evening.  This morning is starting cloudy however, and it 
; is colder.  Rain is also threatening, so I doubt that the good 
; day will be repeated.
; 
; For me it will be just another workday.  When I finish, I will 
; have to decide what kind of fractal theme to tackle next.  Check 
; back tomorrow to see what I dream up.  Until then, take care, 
; and be at unity with both yourself and the cosmos.
