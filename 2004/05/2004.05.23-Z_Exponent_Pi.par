; FOTD -- May 23, 2004 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Unless I am mistaken, today's image is the third consecutive one 
; with a rating of a lowly 3.  FOTD quality seems to be slipping.  
; The work rush here at F.C. is taking its toll.
; 
; There is an infinite family of 'zexpe' fractals with an exponent 
; of epsilon, so why not a family of 'zexpi' fractals with an 
; exponent of pi?  In fact, there is a family of 'zexpi' fractals, 
; (I just decided there is), and one of its infinite number serves 
; as the source of today's image, which I have named Z-Exponent-Pi.
; 
; The scene of the image is very near the negative real axis of 
; its parent, in an area filled with discontinuities.  The render 
; time of 4-1/2 minutes gives an overall value of 65, which, 
; depending on the individual fractalist, may or may not be worth 
; the effort.  The simplest and quickest way to see the image is 
; to view it on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Saturday was quite warm and sunny here at Fractal Central.  The 
; high temperature of 90F 32C was near perfect for both fractal 
; cats and cicadas.  The cats watched from the yard while the 
; cicadas sang in the trees, and as far as I could tell, everyone 
; was happy.  When evening arrived, the cicadas stopped singing 
; and the dynamic duo came indoors for their treat.  Today is 
; starting the same.
; 
; I'm going to take it as easy as possible today.  It looks like a 
; very busy week coming up.  Until next FOTD, which I still hope 
; to have ready in 24 hours, take care, and see you then.
