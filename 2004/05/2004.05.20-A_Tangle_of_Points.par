; FOTD -- May 20, 2004 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have another very busy day ahead of me, so I must again be 
; brief.
; 
; Today brings another 'nothing' fractal, worth only a lowly 3.  
; The low rating reflects the disappointment I feel with it.  I 
; have named the image "A Tangle of Points" because it reminds me 
; of a tangle of vines.  It is part of the larger fractal that is 
; created when portions of Z^(-0.8) and Z^(-7.5) are combined and 
; (1/C) is added.
; 
; The image has been 'evaporated', and therefore consists totally 
; of 'inside' points made visible by the 'bof61' inside fill.  
; Other fills might have done better, but I had no chance to try 
; them.
; 
; The rating of 3 and render time of 7 minutes combine into an 
; overall value of 41.  All this becomes meaningless when the 
; completed image is downloaded from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Clouds hung tough all day Wednesday here at Fractal Central.  
; Combined with occasional light rain and a temperature of 82F 
; 28C, the lack of sun kept the fractal cats safely ensconced 
; indoors.  They were only mildly annoyed however, and spent the 
; afternoon sleeping by the window.  Today is again starting 
; cloudy, but at least it is dry.  The cats are still sleeping.  
; It is too early to predict what kind of day they will have.
; 
; As usual, I have a lot of work to do.  Unless the unexpected 
; happens, the next FOTD will appear here in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and where is the world going, other than 
; around the sun?
