; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's parent fractal I combined positive and negative 
; Z^1.5 with 1/3 as much positive and negative Z^4.5, and set 
; initial Z to -1.  This parent fractal is not really a single 
; fractal, but rather a scattering of tiny open areas, some of 
; which are small Mandelbrot sets, while others are mere shapeless 
; holes.  The place I chose to explore was the area just east of 
; the tiny westernmost M-set.
; 
; This area holds many scattered bits and pieces of fractal 
; debris.  Much of this debris is concentrated around large 
; central disks, like satellites circling a planet.  The debris is 
; plentiful, but only a few pieces contain midgets.  Today's image 
; shows a midget lying in this field of debris.
; 
; I named the image "The Golden Egg".  The golden color is 
; obvious, but as for that egg, well, I have no idea where it 
; might be.  I rendered the image with the outside set to 'tdis'.  
; I find I am using this option more often, since it does rather 
; well on disconnected scenes such as today's, where the standard 
; 'iter' rendering falls flat.
; 
; I could rate the image no higher than a 5.  It is not all that 
; striking and we have seen many similar images before.  But the 
; render time is only 3-1/2 minutes, which raises the overall 
; value to a respectable 147.  Perhaps the most respectable way to 
; see the golden egg image is to download it from Paul's web site

; 
; Friday here at Fractal Central was warm and sunny enough until 
; 2pm, when a rain squall arrived and the temperature dropped from 
; 86F 30C to 67F 19C.  When the wind arose, the cats beat a hasty 
; retreat and spent the rest of the day on their window shelf, 
; watching the outside activity from inside.  By evening they were 
; mildly annoyed, but only a minor treat of tuna was needed to 
; make them happy.  This morning it is cooler with lots of clouds. 
; The duo is likely to have another less-than-perfect day.
; 
; For me it's likely to be an uneventful day, that is unless the 
; aliens arrive from space.  Since I expect no aliens, I will be 
; free to return in 24 hours with another fractal.  Until then, 
; take care, and I wonder if the aliens know about fractals.
