; FOTD -- May 25, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have been doing some pondering since the last FOTD.  Yesterday 
; I received in the mail a special report from 'Scientific 
; American' magazine with the title "Are You a Hologram?"  At one 
; place the article states that the three-dimensional world we see 
; around us might be an illusion that we are creating, that in 
; reality we are two-dimensional somethings.  There is an 
; illustration showing a two-dimensional woman imagining that she 
; is three-dimensional.
; 
; This revelation nearly knocked me flat!  I thought that the 
; assumed number of dimensions in our universe was increasing, not 
; decreasing.  And if we really are two-dimensional, then it must 
; be possible to imagine more dimensions.  So what is keeping us 
; as 2-D beings from imagining four dimensions.  Finally, I wonder 
; about the nature of the 2-D things that are having the illusion 
; of three-dimensional space.  It is all so complex.
; 
; I like things simple.  Complexity brings confusion; simplicity 
; brings ease of understanding.  At least that's the way it's 
; supposed to work.  Of course, it often happens that things which 
; at first appear quite simple turn out to be surprisingly 
; complex.  And nowhere is this unexpected complexity more evident 
; than in the world of fractals.
; 
; The iterated expression behind today's image is Z^1.5+C, as 
; simple an expression as one could hope to run into in the arcane 
; field of mathematics.  Yet it has an infinity of infinite worlds 
; hidden within it.
; 
; Today's parent fractal is but one of these infinity of worlds.  
; It is a shapeless thing with bits and pieces of itself lying 
; scattered to the west of the main bay.  This bay has a 
; rudimentary East Valley, and today's scene is located in the 
; chaos along the southern shoreline of this valley.  (In this 
; case, the northern shoreline is entirely different.)  I named 
; the image "A Hot Midget" because to me at least, the midget at 
; the center looks overheated.
; 
; It is a curious midget, almost giving the impression that it 
; cannot decide what shape to take, and has decided to try to take 
; all shapes.  There is an obvious smaller midget lying on the 
; midget's main filament.  I have already checked this smaller 
; midget and found it to be both less interesting and far slower 
; to render.
; 
; After carefully considering the situation, I rated the image at 
; a 5, which is not good and not bad.  After all, this is the kind 
; of stuff I was doing 12 years ago.  Back then it would have 
; rated a 7 or 8.  Nowadays, the 5 is all I could give it.  When 
; the render time of 22 minutes is considered, the overall value 
; rates a 22 also.
; 
; With images of such mediocre worth, perhaps the wisest way to 
; view them is to download them from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Another very warm and sunny day here at Fractal Central, with a 
; temperature of 90F 32C, was acceptable for the dynamic duo, who 
; spent an hour in the yard, fighting off the cicadas that were 
; threatening to overwhelm them.  Actually, I think the ear-split-
; ting singing of the bugs disturbs the duo more than the bugs 
; themselves.  The singing masks the warning sounds of approaching 
; threats.  Today is starting sunny but less warm.  The singing is 
; very loud however, and it remains to be seen how the duo will 
; react.
; 
; As usual, my day will be much improved when the work is 
; finished.  Until next FOTD, take care, and see you in the 
; fractal vicinity.
