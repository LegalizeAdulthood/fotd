; FOTD -- May 04, 2004 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In the two most recent FOTD discussions I wrote of making FOTD 
; rating points by using unusual program features instead of 
; skilled fractal hunting and coloring.  Today's image emphasizes 
; this dilemma, for in it I have used a bit of both.
; 
; I have indeed used a bit of program trickery.  The inside parts 
; of fractals are 'really' flat black.  In today's FOTD, I have 
; departed from 'reality' by rendering the basically flat-black 
; image using the 'bof61' feature, which colors the inside 
; according to the number of the iteration that brings the points 
; there closest to the origin.
; 
; The fractal skill part lies in finding the scene in the first 
; place.  The parent fractal was created by combining Z^(-1.618) 
; with 1/10 as much Z^(-16.18) and adding (1/C).  This parent 
; comes in two main parts, and consists of two oversized disconnec-
; ted areas of action, one north of the other.  Both areas have 
; open Mandeloid features with ample places to explore.  I chose 
; to explore some distance inland from the southeast shoreline of 
; the indescribable Mandeloid lying in the northern half of the 
; parent.
; 
; I went rather deep before stumbling upon the scene illustrated 
; in today's image.  Once I found the scene, I evaporated it and 
; applied the 'bof61' fill to what remained.  Then I applied a bit 
; of artistic skill when I colored the scene.  The result appears 
; as today's image, which, despite all the above talk, rates only 
; a slightly-above-average 6.  The overall value is 149.
; 
; I named the picture "Another Forest", because it reminds me of a 
; fantastic forest, and I have seen so many similar images that 
; they are starting to become boring.  But the image is still 
; worth a look.  It takes only 4 minutes to render, so boot up 
; your version of Fractint and give the included parameter file a 
; run, or hurry to Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download the completed image from there.
; 
; A cold rain prevailed all day Monday here at Fractal Central, 
; keeping the cat duo confined to their window shelf, where they 
; spent the afternoon watching birds and squirrels.  The tempera-
; ture of 48F 9C felt more like February than May.  Today is 
; starting sunny but quite chilly.  The fractal cats will need to 
; be brave if they hope to have any prolonged time outside.
; 
; As for me, I'll finish the business work, then start disposing 
; of that fallen fractal tree limb that is still half-blocking the 
; fractal alley.  When and if I complete these burdensome tasks, 
; I'll visit Fractal Land.  Until next FOTD, take care, and expect 
; the unexpected.
