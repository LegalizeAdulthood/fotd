; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a very fine example of what I call a dry 
; lake.  It is a place where a midget almost appears, but doesn't 
; quite make it to the surface.  It would seem to be easy to track 
; down the midget by varying initial Z until the midget appears, 
; but this plan will not work.  To begin, I am not sure that there 
; actually is a midget lying nearby.  Also, when initial Z is 
; varied, the scene moves off the screen faster than it can be 
; kept track of.
; 
; Maybe the midget, if one does exist, lies in an alternate 
; reality, where the universal laws are different.  Then again, 
; maybe it does not.  Today's scene, at least as far as I tracked 
; it, which is not very far, opens up into a symmetrical hole with 
; no resemblance whatever to a quadratic midget.
; 
; I named the image "Alternate Reality" because the midget is 
; nowhere to be seen.  And also I am fascinated by the idea of 
; alternate realities, from the humble seven or so spirit planes 
; of the occultists to the infinity of alternate realities that 
; are fashionable among physicists.  As a side note, I wonder why 
; it is considered kooky and irrational for occultists to speak of 
; a few spirit worlds, and cutting-edge science for physicists to 
; speak of an infinity of alternate universes, where everything 
; possible, presumably including the spirit worlds, actually does 
; exist.
; 
; While trying to understand this inconsistency, I will remind 
; fractal fans that, even without a midget at its center, today's 
; image rates a 6.  And when the 15-minute render time is consi-
; dered, its overall value registers a 38.
; 
; When the completed image is downloaded from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; the value increases.
; 
; The weather unexpectedly turned sunny on Saturday afternoon here 
; at Fractal Central.  There was no rain, and the temperature 
; reached a warmer-than-expected 64F 18C.  As a result, the cats 
; were happier than expected.  Today is starting sunny and warmer. 
; I expect more happy cats.
; 
; There is not much for me to do today other than perhaps a bit of 
; yard work.  Those 17-year cicadas will be coming out any day 
; now.  Their countless holes and mud-turrets are under every 
; tree.  They are harmless, except for the noise they make and for 
; the cats who eat them and stuff themselves to the bursting 
; point.  Until next time, take care, and spend a little extra 
; time with your favorite fractal.
