; FOTD -- May 31, 2001 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To create today's image I added a small, (0.03), imaginary part 
; to the exponent of the Z^2.01+C Mandeloid, and stood back to see 
; what would happen.  What happened is that the Mandelbrot set 
; suffered a total breakdown, both in its macroscopic and micro-
; scopic aspects.
; 
; The real axis split completely apart, especially on its negative 
; side.  Seahorse Valley dissolved into two vague disconnected 
; valleys, and East Valley broke apart as though an earthquake 
; fault had appeared and slipped down its center.  To find today's 
; image I examined the southern side of East Valley, or more 
; accurately, what is left of East Valley.
; 
; I found the valley totally changed, a whole new world waiting to 
; be explored.  I chose a narrow sliver of chaos to examine, and 
; there I found today's scene, which for some crazy reason I named 
; "Not Quite Insane", and rated at a 6.
; 
; I have no idea why I have so rarely used complex exponents in my 
; fractals.  Perhaps I am keeping things a bit too simple.  But 
; now that I have seen what complex exponents can do, I will be 
; using them more often.  In fact, I have already found several 
; additional interesting scenes in today's parent fractal, which I 
; will be presenting in the days to come.
; 
; Today's image, with its very fast render time, has an overall 
; value of a whopping 337.  Those who prefer their fractals pre-
; cooked may find the completed GIF image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Lots of clouds, with some sun and a temperature of 75F 24C, kept 
; the dynamic duo happy under the holly trees most of Sunday 
; afternoon.  When evening arrived, they came indoors without 
; complaint.  Unfortunately, this morning is threatening rain.  I 
; fear the good day will not be repeated.
; 
; My ever-present graphic-design work is heavy but bearable.  One 
; of these days I'll collect my million dollars from one of those 
; international lotteries.  I have won at least 100 of them, but 
; never collected my winnings.  Then I'll be able to devote all 
; my time to fractals.  But today is not that day, so it's time 
; to get to work.  Until next FOTD, take care, and those who 
; enjoy fractals are the richest on earth.
