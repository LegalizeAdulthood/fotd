; FOTD -- May 06, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I am once again fabulously wealthy.  In my e-mail this morning I 
; found that I had won not one but three international lotteries, 
; and there are also two people in Africa who are ready to share 
; over 50-million dollars with me.  The irony is that if I had 
; somehow found a way to eliminate all spam, I would never have 
; realized that I have become rich.  I must celebrate by finding a 
; rich fractal.
; 
; Today's fractal however is only middle class.   True, it is a 
; four-star fractal, but it is not four-star in the quality sense, 
; such as a four-star hotel or restaurant might be.  In fact, it 
; rates only an average 5.  It is four-star because it has four 
; stars, or more accurately pentagrams, surrounding the central 
; midget.
; 
; The parent fractal, which combines diminishing portions of 
; Z^(-1), Z^(-2), Z^(-3) and Z^(-4), is a delicate inside-out 
; thing -- a cloud of evaporating fractal debris floating in the 
; infinite nothingness of fractal space.  Mandel buds line the 
; outer edges of the debris cloud, with the largest two buds lying 
; at the northern and southern extremities.  Today's scene is 
; located some distance west of the southern bud.
; 
; Since the parent fractal was already evaporating when I stumbled 
; upon it, I helped the evaporation along by raising the bailout 
; (escape-radius) to one-googol.  (no relation to the popular 
; internet search engine)  I then re-rendered the blank screen 
; with the inside set to bof61 to produce today's image.
; 
; The hum-drum average rating of a 5 and render time of over 23 
; minutes holds the overall value to a measly 21.  But that value 
; may be increased by downloading the finished image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A near-perfect day here at Fractal Central on Wednesday, with 
; lots of sun and a temperature of 70F 21C, was spoiled by a brief 
; thunder-squall at 6pm.  The cats scurried inside when the 
; weather turned bad, but it was no great loss.  They were ready 
; to come inside anyway.  Today is starting similarly.  It looks 
; like another good day for the cat duo.
; 
; For me, the problem is the fractal grass, which is up again and 
; in need of a trimming.  And before I return to Fractal Land, 
; there is some commercial work to do as well.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be of fractal 
; mind and sound body.
