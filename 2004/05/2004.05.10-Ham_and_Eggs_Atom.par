; FOTD -- May 10, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the same shapeless parent fractal that 
; gave us yesterday's image.  But while yesterday's image was 
; found in a chaotic area in the western part of the parent, 
; today's is located in a valley in the eastern part.
; 
; Yesterday's image consisted of outside material rendered with 
; the 'tdis' option.  Today's is an 'evaporated' image, consisting 
; totally of inside points rendered with the 'bof61' inside fill.  
; I named it "Ham-and-Eggs Atom" for no good reason.  Perhaps I 
; was thinking of breakfast.
; 
; I am actually starting to become a bit weary of these so-called 
; evaporated images of mine.  As a result, I could give the image 
; a rating no higher than an average 5.  I am also less than 
; satisfied with today's coloring.  The colors are strong but the 
; balance is too far toward the magenta, and this held the rating 
; down.  The overall value, for any who might be concerned, is 35.
; 
; The completed GIF image is available at:

; 
; Sunday passed sunny and warm here at Fractal Central, the 
; temperature of 86F 30C leaving the cats happy.  A mild thunder-
; shower arose late in the evening, but by that time, the cats 
; were sleeping soundly.  Today is starting sunny and warm again.  
; The duo should again be happy.
; 
; For me it will be the usual amount of work before play.  Until 
; next FOTD, take care, and fractals have been proved interesting 
; beyond all reasonable doubt.
