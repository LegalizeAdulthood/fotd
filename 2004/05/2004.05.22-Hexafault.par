; FOTD -- May 22, 2004 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'm still far behind in the work, so the discussion will once 
; again have to be brief.
; 
; I think it was Lee Skinner who named the Z^(2.1828...) fractal 
; the 'Zexpe' fractal.  To create today's image, I have taken the 
; 'Zexpe' fractal, and with the MandelbrotBC2 formula, calculated 
; it at a different level to produce a different yet similar 
; fractal.
; 
; This fractal is indescribable, basically a Mandeloid standing 
; on its nose, with branch cuts and irregularities everywhere.  
; Several jagged spirals lie on the northwest part of this 
; fractal; today's scene is rather deep in one of these spirals.
; 
; I named the image "Hexafault", because the midget at the center 
; is sliced almost perfectly symmetrically by six major branch 
; cuts, or fault lines.  It is rare to see such fault-line 
; symmetry in a fractional-power fractal.
; 
; Unfortunately, I gave almost no effort to the coloring, not that 
; it would have made much of an improvement if I had.  As a 
; result, the rating is another lowly 3.  But the very fast render 
; time of 33 seconds raises the overall value to a very respect-
; able 534.
; 
; Those who prefer to avoid rendering may download the completed 
; image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather was pleasant enough here at Fractal Central on 
; Friday, with some sun and a temperature of 81F 27C, but the cats 
; had to be escorted as they took their daily walks in the yard, 
; to keep them from overstuffing themselves with those easy-to-
; catch cicadas that are flying around by the millions.  Today is 
; starting sunny and quite warm, and the cicadas are quite active. 
; It looks like another chaperoned day for the duo.
; 
; For me, it looks like I'm going to try to get caught up.  If I 
; make reasonable progress in the work, the next FOTD will appear 
; in 24 hours.  If not, it might be 48 or 72 hours.  Until next 
; FOTD, take care, and who will be first to realize that the 
; universe is a great fractal.
