; FOTD -- May 24, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is something different.  It has no midget at the 
; center, and it has been created by one of the built-in formulas 
; -- the manzpower.  To find the image, I drew the Z^(998.1)+C 
; Mandeloid and examined it in the area of the negative real axis.
; 
; Fractals of such a high order are normally very dull objects, 
; appearing as circles with a multitude of identical tiny bays 
; lying along the perimeter.  The inner detail of these bays has a 
; similarity that makes exploration boring.
; 
; But today's image was drawn with a fractional power of Z, and 
; that fractional part makes the difference.  Most of the parent 
; fractal consists of the expected identical bays.  The difference 
; lies along the negative real axis, where the fractal is 
; splitting apart and new scenes are springing into existence.  It 
; is in this area that today's image lies.
; 
; In today's image the view window has been rotated 90 degrees.  
; East is up and north is left.  The X-axis runs up and down the 
; center of the screen.  The magnitude of the scene is a nominal 
; 2x(10^8), the maxiter an unimpressive 1500.
; 
; The resulting image reminds me of a fantastic tree set against 
; an alien sky, with smoky globules of light scattered among the 
; branches.  For reasons not recalled, I named it "Fun in the 
; Sun".  The tree itself is unlike anything that could be found on 
; earth, but if one of the leading quantum theories is correct, 
; and an infinity of alternate universes does exist, then this 
; exact scene not only exists, but exists an infinity of times.
; 
; The rating of a 5 is a fair representation of the image's worth. 
; I found it almost automatically and spent very little time in 
; rendering or coloring it.  When the render time of 2 minutes is 
; considered, the overall value is an exciting 226.
; 
; For fractal convenience, the parameter file of the image has 
; been rendered and the finished image posted to the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Sunday was a repeat of Saturday here at Fractal Central.  The 
; temperature reached 91F 33C under lots of sun, and the cats 
; spent several hours in the yard, watching cicadas and occasion-
; ally eating one that fluttered too near.  In the evening they 
; came inside and settled down without complaint.  Today looks as 
; though it will be another repeat.
; 
; In my corner of F.C. the work is piling up, so I had best get 
; started.  Until next FOTD, which will most likely, but not 
; certainly, appear in 24 hours, take care, and be kind to all 
; types of fractals.
