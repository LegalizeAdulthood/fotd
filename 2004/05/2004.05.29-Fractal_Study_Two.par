; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It seems as though every time I ponder the question, 'What is 
; the world made of?' the answer is different.  In my lifetime I 
; have seen it made of atoms, sub-atomic particles, probability 
; waves, energy, quarks, multi-dimensional strings and membranes, 
; holograms, information, thought, and even nothing.  Of course, 
; all of these things are inventions, the result of trying to 
; reduce something beyond our understanding to the level of 
; everyday experience, and they are all a little right but mostly 
; wrong.  We could keep inventing the basic stuff of existence for 
; a million years, and we would never find an answer that totally 
; works.  The universe is actually a fractal, and fractals are 
; made of numbers.  (BTW, I cannot prove this.)
; 
; The universe is made of numbers.  As for the constitution of 
; numbers, well, they are most likely made of God, or whatever 
; non-offensive word Atheists choose to use.  And as to the 
; nature of God . . . I refuse to speculate.
; 
; There are an infinity of numbers however, and this leads to the 
; question of which of the infinity of numbers are the basic 
; building blocks.  My guess is that the whole numbers, positive 
; and negative, are the building blocks, with the positive number 
; 'one' being by far the most common.  Of course, I could always 
; be wrong.  ;-)
; 
; Today's image pictures a midget in the Z^((sqrt(2))+0.03i)+C 
; Mandeloid.  I rarely use complex exponents in my fractal 
; explorations, but decided to try it today anyway.  Adding just 
; 0.03 part of 'i' went a long way, totally changing the shape of 
; the parent fractal.  I'll have to do this more often.
; 
; I named the image "Fractal Study-Two", though I could just as 
; easily have named it "Kilroy Was Here".  The central midget is 
; shaped suspiciously like that character with the oversized nose 
; who was seen peeping over every fence during the time of the 
; Second World War.
; 
; Yesterday's image took almost 4 hours to render, and even then 
; rated only a 5.  Today's image renders in only 2 minutes, and 
; rates a 7.  This gives it an overall value of 326, a vast 
; improvement over yesterday's rating of a miserable 2.
; 
; Regardless of ratings or render time, the FOTD images are always 
; available for download from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A partly cloudy day here at Fractal Central on Friday, with a 
; temperature of 79F 26C, gave the fractal cats several pleasant 
; hours in the yard.  When the day ended, they came indoors 
; without complaint.  Today is starting sunny and cooler.  These 
; are conditions that promise the best for the dynamic duo.
; 
; I must clear away more of the backed-up work before I start 
; thinking again of fractals, and the time to start is now.  Until 
; next time, take care, and fractals are neither real nor unreal.
