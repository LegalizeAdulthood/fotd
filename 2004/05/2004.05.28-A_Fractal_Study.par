; FOTD -- May 28, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The combination of an unusually heavy work load and a balky 
; computer has once again put me behind in my work, so today's 
; discussion will again be brief.
; 
; For today's fractal I decided to move in close-up to study a 
; midget of the order 1.5.  The parent fractal is an unimpressive 
; thing that appears to spiral around the origin, with a prominent 
; discontinuity along the positive real axis.  The shoreline of 
; this parent is lined with irregular buds.  Today's scene is 
; located on the inside of the northern branch of the valley of a 
; small bud on the eastern edge of the parent.
; 
; To be sure I captured all of the midget, I raised the maxiter to 
; 500,000.  Even with such an extreme maxiter, it still appears 
; that the midget is not quite fully defined, but with a render 
; time approaching 4 hours, the present maxiter will have to 
; suffice.
; 
; The midget itself is typical of midgets in this range, showing 
; little tendency to develop the semi-chaotic patterns around it 
; that make quadratic midgets so attractive.  In fact, there is 
; almost a feeling of 'anything can happen' about the scene.
; 
; An orbit check shows that the entire scene has a periodicity of 
; 3, with but minor variations in the different areas of the 
; midget.  I have not checked the Julia aspect of today's scene, 
; though it is certainly equally disorganized.
; 
; I named the picture "A Fractal Study" because that's what it is. 
; Actually, I studied the image very little.  I simply started it 
; going and let it calculate for four hours while I worked on the 
; balky machine.  The rating of a 5 could be a gift or a robbery, 
; depending on one's view.  The extreme render time drags down the 
; overall value to an abysmal 2.
; 
; But all is not lost, for I have sent the finished GIF image on 
; ahead to Paul, and it will soon be posted on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; ready for immediate download.
; 
; Both Wednesday and Thursday were quite warm here at Fractal 
; Central, with brief showers both evenings.  On both days the 
; fractal cats managed to hold off the hordes of cicadas long 
; enough for a few restful hours in the shade of the holly trees.  
; Today is starting partly cloudy and slightly cooler.  The cats 
; have not yet decided what kind of day they will have.
; 
; If I catch up in the work, today could be restful for me, but 
; that will take quite a bit of effort.  Until next FOTD, take 
; care, and despite all appearances to the contrary, we could all 
; be part of a big hologram.
