; FOTD -- February 06, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's FOTD we take a brief break from the world of 
; HyperMandelbrot stuff and return to the world of double negative 
; images.  The parent fractal of today's fractal combines Z^(-5.5) 
; with 3 parts of Z^(-1.5).  This parent is little more than a 
; near shapeless jumble of large bays oriented east-west and 
; surrounded by a field of smaller disconnected satellite 
; fractals.  Today's scene is located on the shore line of a large 
; bud on the eastern edge of the easternmost large bay.
; 
; The name "The Minor Enigma" has little to do with the image.  In 
; fact, it has little to do with anything, since it came to mind 
; at lunch time, while I was watching the 'news'.
; 
; The art aspect rates a 7, and even this might be a bit too 
; liberal.  The math could be rated no higher than a 6, since the 
; math trick is over 10 years old.
; 
; It's a different story with the calculation time however.  The 
; one minute it takes to finish the calculation on a SOTA machine 
; can hardly be surpassed other than by checking one of the web 
; sites.
; 
; Calculation may be avoided by viewing the finished image at:

; 
; Today dawned mostly clear and cold with a temperature of 9F -13C 
; here at Fractal Central.  The sun prevailed through the rest of 
; the day, raising the temperature to an afternoon high of 27F 
; -3C.  The fractal cats enjoyed the sun, which despite the cold 
; is getting higher and stronger every day.  The fractal humans 
; had a bit of a problem digging out the fractal vehicle, but 
; after a bit of work, freedom was achieved.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  I would bet a week's 
; income on it.  Until then, take care, and biologists tell us 
; that we have brains.  I have no trouble with this.  But then 
; they claim that our conscious selves are by-products of our 
; brains, and this is where I get confused.  It appears to me that 
; the biologists are claiming that our brains are creating the 
; by-products that know they have brains creating by-products.  
; This is circular reasoning if I ever heard it.
