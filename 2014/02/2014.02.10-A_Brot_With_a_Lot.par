; 
; FOTD -- February 10, 2013 (Rating A-9,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image returns us to hyperland, where we check the 
; strange convolutions of a minibrot on the east shore line of the 
; north branch of Seahorse Valley of the classic Mandelbrot set.  
; (To eliminate the convolutions and see the classic scene, change 
; the real(p3) parameter to zero and re-calculate the image.)  I 
; have no idea of what's going on inside the minibrots in these 
; types of images, but whatever it is, it certainly makes some 
; interesting scenes.
; 
; In my opinion, the art aspect fully deserves the rating of 9 
; that I gave it.  The math is still very puzzling, but by this 
; time the puzzle is totally familiar and is no closer to being 
; solved.  The math rating of a 6 seems on the mark.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-2/3 minutes is speedy enough to keep 
; impatient fractal minds from drifting to non-fractal things.  
; Viewing the image on the web sites will work equally as well.
; 
; Check the image in finished form on the FOTD web sites at:

; 
; Today brought a mix of sun and clouds, and a temperature of 28F 
; -2C to Fractal Central here in central Pennsylvania.  The 
; fractal cats paid little attention to the outside conditions.  
; They were more interested in playing, eating and sleeping.  The 
; fractal humans cleared the FC sidewalk early, leading to another 
; routine day.
; 
; There is a 90-percent chance that the next FOTD will be posted 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and technophiles claim that 
; technology will eventually create a paradise on earth.  But I 
; wonder how long it will be before the paradise arrives and how 
; many people will be left on earth to enjoy it when it finally 
; does arrive.
