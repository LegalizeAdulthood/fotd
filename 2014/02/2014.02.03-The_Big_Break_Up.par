; FOTD -- February 03, 2014 (Rating A-5,M-8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the hyper stuff filling an unresolved 
; filament in the East Valley area of yesterday's image.  Its name 
; is "The Big Break-Up", which does not refer to a failed love 
; relationship, (sorry ladies) but rather to the two arms at the 
; center of the image that have broken off from the other four.
; 
; The image is actually a two-dimensional slice through the four-
; dimensional HyperMandelbrot set.  And this 4-D HyperMandelbrot 
; set is a 4-D slice through its parent eight-dimensional Juli-
; brot.  I'll make no effort to describe things possible in 8-D 
; space; It's hard enough to describe things in 4-D space.  But 
; one thing certain is that:
; 
;          8 lines
;          28 planes
;          56 3-spaces
;          70 4-spaces
;          56 5-spaces
;          28 6-spaces
;          8 7-spaces
; 
; pass through every point in 8-D space.
; 
; Not surprisingly, this series of numbers appears in Pascal's 
; Triangle, as do many other interesting number series.
; 
; Down to this point, the near circular hyper-holes have had six 
; broad arms converging toward their centers.  But in today's 
; image, two of these arms, the two on the right, are breaking 
; away from the main mass, and from here on down there are only 
; four arms converging on the centers of the holes.  Will two more 
; arms break away somewhere down in the bottomless depths and 
; leave us with only two converging arms?  I have no idea, but the 
; number of arms remains at four as far as the Fractint program 
; can take us.
; 
; As far as I can see, there is too little art in the image for a 
; rating above an everyday average 5.  The math aspect is far more 
; interesting however, and rates an 8.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/3 minutes is fast enough to prevent 
; impatience, but the task of setting up and running the included 
; parameter file remains unsolved.  The web sites will solve this 
; situation.
; 
; Calculation is really not much fun, so avoid it by checking the 
; finished image on the web sites at:

; 
; Snow began at daybreak here at Fractal Central today, and 
; continued at a moderate rate all morning, piling up to about 5 
; inches or 13cm by the time it ended in the afternoon.  The 
; fractal cats were amused by the falling snow for an hour or so, 
; then kept themselves busy by chasing each other up and down the 
; hallway.  The humans were in work mode in the morning, but we 
; shifted to snow-clearing mode in the afternoon.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted shortly.  To see how shortly, check 
; back here at frequent intervals.  Until this big fractal event 
; happens, take care, and when someone claims that matter is the 
; ultimate reality, I don't mind; and when someone else claims 
; that mind is the ultimate reality, it doesn't matter.
