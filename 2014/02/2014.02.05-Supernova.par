; FOTD -- February 05, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image reminds me of a stellar supernova explosion, which 
; is what I named it.  It is a scene on the northwest shore line 
; of the main bay of a perturbed version of the HyperMandelbrot 
; set.
; 
; This is an area of the Hyper set that until today I have never 
; checked.  And from the nature of the area beyond the border of 
; today's scene, there might be rich pickings to be found nearby.
; 
; In my opinion, both the art and math values of the image rate an 
; 8.  And the brief calculation time of 1-1/4 minutes makes the 
; image an even better bargain.  The ultimate in convenience may 
; be found however on the FOTD web sites, where the finished image 
; is posted.
; 
; The image is posted online at:

; 
; About 8 inches or 20cm of heavy wet snow fell overnight here at 
; Fractal Central, which made for heavy work clearing the fractal 
; sidewalk.  Luckily, FL kept the hot coffee flowing until the job 
; was done.  The rest of the day was cloudy with a temperature of 
; exactly freezing.  The fractal cats noticed the changed appear-
; ance of the outside world, but were too busy chasing each other 
; around the house to give the outside much attention.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted before the sun engulfs the earth, 
; which will be in something like 6-billion years.  (Luckily, it's 
; not 6-million years.)  Until this magic moment arrives, take 
; care, and science sees man as a body with a conscious mind as a 
; by-product, yet it is this by-product that observes the body and 
; invents theories about how the body creates the mind.
