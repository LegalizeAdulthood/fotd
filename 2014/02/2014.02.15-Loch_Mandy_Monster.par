; FOTD -- February 15, 2014 (Rating A-6,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was done in haste, and it shows in the erratic 
; coloring, which holds the art rating to a 6.  The math trick is 
; so old that I could rate it no higher than a 5.
; 
; The name "Loch Mandy Monster" came to mind when I noticed that 
; the eight small open areas surrounding the central minibrot are 
; shaped quite like the monsters that people sometimes claim to 
; have seen swimming in Loch Ness as well as in other long thin 
; lakes that were once arms of the open sea.  Being a sensible 
; person when common sense is appropriate, I find it hard to 
; believe that a breeding population of physical monsters could 
; thrive and remain undetected in these lakes.  As for monsters 
; from another dimension, I have no comment.
; 
; The oversized parent fractal resulted when I combined 4 parts 
; of Z^(-1.5) with 1 part of Z^(-6) before adding (1/C) on each 
; iteration.  This parent is shaped like a violin lying on its 
; side.  Today's scene is located on a minor filament extending 
; from a small bud on the shore line of a large critical bud at 
; the east end of the parent fractal.
; 
; The calculation time of only 45 seconds will pass in a flash and 
; a half.  Whether instant satisfaction is found when the flash 
; subsides depends on the whim of the individual fractalist.  
; Visiting the web sites will reduce any fractal disappointment.
; 
; So avoid great disappointment.  Check the finished image at:

; 
; The day began with snow here at Fractal Central.  By the time it 
; ended just after noon about 6 new inches or 15cm had piled up.  
; The fractal he-man leaped into action as soon as the snow ended, 
; and within an hour the sidewalk was clear.  But the sidewalk now 
; looks like a canyon, with shoulder high cliffs of snow and ice 
; piled along both sides, totally covering FL's prize rose bushes.
; 
; But now there are few places left to pile the snow, and even 
; worse, the coffee is running low.  Luckily, more coffee is 
; available at the nearby convenience store, which never closes, 
; but with heavy snow again expected on Monday, the only place to 
; pile it will be on top of the present piles.  The fractal cats, 
; never ones to worry themselves over human problems, were puzzled 
; about the strange appearance of the outer world, but soon turned 
; their attention to play and food.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, give or take a few.  
; This is not a guarantee.  With nothing else to do however, it is 
; reasonably assured.  Until then, take care, and would fractals 
; still exist even if the so-called 'big bang' that supposedly 
; created our universe had never happened?
