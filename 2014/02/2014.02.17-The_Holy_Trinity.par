; FOTD -- February 17, 2013 (Rating A-7,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "The Holy Trinity".  This has nothing to 
; do with religion, where the Holy Trinity refers to the three 
; aspects of one god.  It refers to the three obvious minibrots 
; hidden deeper in the image, which are a sign that the scene lies 
; in the basin of attraction of a larger minibrot that in turn 
; lies in the basin of the parent fractal.
; 
; The parent fractal came into being when I combined 1 negative 
; part of Z^(-7.7) with 7 negative parts of Z^(-1.1) and added 
; (1/C).  This parent is a grossly oversized and quite complex 
; thing consisting of a scattering of oddly shaped bays with fila-
; ments extending from them and terminating in circles.  Today's 
; scene lies in a circle southwest of the main field of fractal 
; activity.  The circular theme shows quite strongly in the closed 
; yellow elements surrounding the trinity.
; 
; The art and math aspects of the image both rate a 7.  I'm not 
; sure if this rating justifies the 5-1/2 minutes required to run 
; the parameter file, but the FOTD web sites are always ready to 
; deliver fractal calculation justice.
; 
; Find justice where it is least expected.  Check the finished 
; image on the FOTD web sites at:

; 
; The near total sun today here at Fractal Central was pleasant 
; enough, but the temperature at sunrise was a very chilly +1F 
; -17C, and rose no higher in the afternoon than 25F -4C.  
; The fractal icicles have now grown to nearly 2 meters long and 
; continue growing.  We still have a way to go however if we hope 
; to set a local record.  Some nearby icicles hang over 4 meters 
; long.  The fractal cats are not concerned with ice.  What they 
; want is more food.  The fractal humans are preparing to clear 
; away the next snow, which is expected tomorrow morning.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and be assured, the climate is changing.  This is what 
; climate does when greenhouse gasses are added to the atmosphere. 
; The solution is to find a renewable and non-polluting energy 
; source that does not harm the environment or stifle the economy 
; with higher energy prices, as wind and solar energy would do.  
; Fusion energy is years away if it will ever arrive at all, so do 
; any concerned environmentalists have any world-saving ideas?
