; FOTD -- September 29, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in Seahorse Valley of the Mandeloid 
; that results when the expression Z^(1.5)+C is iterated 1.5 turns 
; up the complex logarithmic hyperspiral.  The hyperspiral is a 
; kind of hyper-dimensional screw that results because the complex 
; log function is multi-valued and can be sliced at any level 
; desired.
; 
; Today's parent fractal resembles a distorted Mandelbrot set 
; rotated so that the large bud faces northwest.  Today's image 
; lies in the southwest branch of the valley that encloses this 
; bud.
; 
; I named the image "Pinwheels in the Dusk" because this is what 
; came to mind when I first saw the image.
; 
; The art rates an 8 since the subdued colors reflect my negative 
; but unfortunately correct outlook on the world.  The math rating 
; of a 6 shows that no new surprises lie in the math aspect.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes will pass fast enough, and 
; if for some reason it does not, the web sites can bring relief.
; 
; The image is posted at:

; 
; Lots of clouds dimmed the sun here at Fractal Central today, but 
; the temperature of 77F 25C kept things quite pleasant.  The 
; fractal cats and humans had an equally pleasant day.
; 
; As for the next FOTD, it will be posted when the time is right.  
; Until the right time arrives, take care, and everyone loves a 
; mystery.  To me, the greatest mystery of the present era is why 
; 'terrorists' are so filled with anger that they are willing to 
; sacrifice their lives.  People do not willingly die simply 
; because, as we hear so often on the news, they hate freedom, 
; (whatever this is supposed to mean).
