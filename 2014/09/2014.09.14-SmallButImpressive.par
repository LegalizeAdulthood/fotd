; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- September 14, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows some of what happens when the expression 
; Z^(1.75)+C is iterated in Mandelbrot mode a mere one-half level 
; up the complex logarithmic hyperspiral.  The parent fractal is 
; little more than a shapeless blob somewhat resembling a squashed 
; bug.  Today's scene is located on a filament extending from the 
; small period-5 bud on the southest side of the main bay.
; 
; The art rates an 8, mostly because of the unusual color scheme, 
; which came about almost totally by accident.  The effect of 
; small terraces was achieved by rendering the scene with the 
; outside set to 'tdis'.
; 
; The math rates a 7.  I rated it because I was rather impressed 
; with the near perfection of the central minibrot, which is quite 
; well shaped, especially considering the chaotic shape of the 
; parent fractal.  In fact, the minibrot could almost pass for an 
; everyday distorted quadratic minibrot.
; 
; The surprisingly undistorted shape of this minibrot inspired the 
; name "Small But Impressive".
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/4 minutes is well within reason, and 
; the web sites are there to make the task even easier.
; 
; So join the trendy set.  Check the FOTD web sites at:

; 
; Today, the second Sunday in September, turned out pleasantly 
; brisk here at Fractal Central, with a mix of sun and clouds, a 
; bracing north wind and an afternoon high temperature of 64F 18C. 
; At least the fractal cats must have thought so, since they 
; checked the outside conditions from their window shelf almost 
; constantly.  The fractal humans meanwhile checked very little of 
; anything.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a day or two or three.  Don't be 
; surprised if it actually appears in one day.  Until whenever, 
; take care, and I can't wait to not buy the latest electronic 
; gadget, though one of these days I might actually pick up one of 
; those throw-away cell phones.  As for now, how do I get along 
; without a cell phone? . . . Actually quite well!
