; FOTD -- September 16, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; At first glance it appears that the minibrot at the center of 
; today's image is quadratic.  At second glance however, things 
; are seen to be not quite as they should be.  The count of the 
; surrounding elements is far from the expected 2,4,8... series, 
; indicating that the minibrot is not quadratic, but of order 1.75.
; 
; The parent fractal is the slice through the hyperspiral at 
; a level of 3 turns up the ladder.  This parent resembles a 
; squashed bug, with a smaller disconnected bug lying just 
; northwest of the main body.  Today's scene is located in a 
; valley on the northeast shore line of this smaller bug.
; 
; I have named the image "Bogus Minibrot" because the central 
; midget so closely resembles a quadratic one, yet is actually 
; created by the expression Z^(1.75)+C.
; 
; The are rates an 8.  I put about 20 minutes effort into the 
; coloring.  The math rating of a 6 lags behind because we have 
; been here so often before.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes is fair enough, and the 
; remaining effort of running the parameter file may be eliminated 
; by viewing the scene on one of the web sites.
; 
; The finished image is available online at:

; 
; Near perfect weather prevailed here at Fractal Central today.  
; The morning fog cleared off by 9am, leading to a day with tons 
; of sun, enough clouds to make things interesting, and a 
; temperature of 68F 20C.  The fractal cats busied themselves 
; watching the pigeons, while the fractal humans watched the work 
; get done.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a day or two or three.  Until 
; whenever this is, take care, and a few hundred years ago we 
; survived without electricity.  Now we would face imminent 
; extinction if we ever lost the use of our hi-tech gadgets.  Is 
; this to be considered progress, and if it is, what is the goal?
