; FOTD -- January 08, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the East Valley area of a tiny 
; half-morphed minibrot just beyond the large minibrot on the main 
; spike of its parent fractal, which is a hugely oversized 
; Mandelbrot set corrupted in its depths by Z^15 energies.  At the 
; depth of today's scene, the Z^15 energies have completely taken 
; over, though the outer elements still retain much quadratic 
; detail.
; 
; I named the image "Magical Fifteen" because I have always seen 
; something magical in the way the higher-order energies take over 
; in the depths of apparently perfectly ordinary Mandelbrot sets.
; 
; In my opinion, the art rates an 8.  I did put about an extra 
; half hour into the coloring to justify the rating.  And the 
; calculation finishes in only 2-1/3 minutes, making the image 
; quite a bargain.  For those shy about calculating fractals, the 
; finished image is posted on the web sites.

; 
; Lots of clouds were the rule today here at Fractal Central.  
; The temperature of 19F -7C was still quite cold, but after the 
; past week, it felt not too bad.  The fractal cats spent the 
; afternoon waiting for the sun to appear.  When it never did, 
; they decided to have a meal.  The humans, who are always 
; occupied with one thing or another, had a busy but un-notable 
; day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted right here in only a few hours.  
; Until then, take care, and why do angels, who are apparently 
; mammals, have feathered wings?  One would think they would fly 
; with bat-like wings such as the devil has.
