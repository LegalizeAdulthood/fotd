; FOTD -- January 01, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Simplest Things".  The name came about 
; when I saw a teen-aged boy texting a message to his friend, who 
; lives only one block away.  It took almost 15 minutes to 
; complete the communication.  I wondered why the boy didn't take 
; a minute to walk one block, meet his friend and give him the 
; message in person.
; 
; Sometimes the simplest things can be the most enjoyable.  And 
; fractals don't come much simpler than the Julia set of Seahorse 
; Valley of the (-Z)^(-2.5)+C Mandeloid.
; 
; The formula that produced the image, the JuliaMiN, is an ancient 
; one by FOTD standards, and there are more complex formulas that 
; could do the same thing plus far more, but the old formula still 
; produces some interesting scenes, such as the one in today's 
; image.
; 
; The exponent of (-Z) in today's Julia set is actually 2.5, 
; though the set in the image resembles a straight cubic fractal 
; more than a fractional one.
; 
; After much pondering I rated the artistic aspect of the image at 
; a 7.  But the math interest is so outdated that I could rate it 
; no higher than a near-failing 4.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes will be no problem for the 
; true fractal fans who do their own calculation.  The others may 
; find happiness by checking the web sites.
; 
; To start the new year on happy street, check the finished image

; 
; The first day of the new year brought lots of clouds to Fractal 
; Central and a temperature that hung around freezing.  The 
; fractal cats had too much fun playing with each other to worry 
; themselves with the weather.  The humans, who are almost as 
; fractal as the cats, had a slow day, which is the way we like it.
; 
; The next FOTD image will be posted most likely on the second day 
; of this year.  Until that moment of glory arrives, take care, 
; and what absolutely necessary technological wonders will break 
; upon the scene this year?  The Shadow knows, but where is he now 
; that we need him to tell us?
