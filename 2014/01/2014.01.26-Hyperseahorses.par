; 
; FOTD -- January 26, 2014 (Rating A-6,M-9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As far as I know, the four-dimensional HyperMandelbrot set is 
; virtually unexplored, so with today's image I have decided that 
; it's time to do some exploration.
; 
; To begin the investigation we see what trouble we can get into 
; in the Seahorse Valley area of the hyper-M-set.  As the 
; coordinates show, today's scene is located deep in the north 
; branch of the valley.  I named the image "Hyperseahorses" 
; because of its location in its parent fractal.  The diagonal 
; shaft is the actual north branch of the valley, which is 
; oriented so that north points to the lower right.
; 
; The main shaft of the quadratic valley is apparent enough, but 
; all the other stuff is part of the hyper-M-set.
; 
; I see almost nothing in the image that even vaguely resembles a 
; seahorse.  What I do see is a medley of features that have 
; little resemblance to the features of the classic M-set.  It 
; will take quite a bit of experimenting to make sense of the 
; things in this image and images to come, but being curious, I'll 
; certainly give it a try.
; 
; The art rates a 6.  I see nothing very artistic in the image.  
; The math however rates a 9, since I'm sure to find a lot of 
; interesting quirks in this area.
; 
; The image calculates in 3 minutes on the average SOTA machine 
; that does not crash when it senses the presence of a DOS 
; program.  The web sites can bail out these machines that panic 
; when DOS appears.
; 
; To avoid all cumbersome calculation, check the finished image at:

; 
; Except for a period of light snow in the afternoon, today was 
; partly cloudy and chilly, but pleasant enough, with a high 
; temperature of 21F -6C.  The fractal cats had a lazy day -- 
; typical for a ten-year-old cat but unusual for a five-month-old 
; kitten.  I had a lazy day to myself, while FL spent the week-end 
; visiting with old friends back in Baltimore.
; 
; The next FOTD will probably be posted in one day.  If it is not, 
; then it will appear in two days.  Until it does appear, take 
; care, and who is really running the world.  Is it the world's 
; governments, the big corporate conglomerations, or could it be 
; the aliens from Sirius C?
