; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- January 23, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-10)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The math rating of today's image is a full-blown 10.  And the 
; image is fully worth it.  The arms filling the central minibrot 
; are the greatest mystery I have yet discovered in my 27 or so 
; years of fractal exploration.  The parent fractal is the 
; everyday 4-dimensional Hypermandelbrot set, which is simply 2 
; overlapping classic M-sets, so these arms have no right to be 
; there.  The mystery is why the infinitesimal value of the 
; real(p4) parameter would have such a great effect on certain 
; fractals.
; 
; The name "The Greatest Mystery" simply states the situation as 
; it is.
; 
; The art value of an 8 is largely due to my coloring efforts.  I 
; have been putting more work into the FOTD's since we began 
; phasing out the graphic design work here at FC a year or so ago, 
; and as the phase-out continues, the FOTD's will get only better. 
; And wait until one of the business machines is switched to a 
; dedicated high-speed fractal unit.
; 
; The calculation time of 3 minutes is about average, but average 
; can always be improved upon.  So for an improvement, check the 
; FOTD web sites.
; 
; The already calculated image is posted at:

; 
; The temperature rose from a morning low of -2F -19C here at 
; Fractal Central to a near tropical afternoon high of 19F -7C, 
; with a few snow flurries thrown in to add interest.  The fractal 
; cats showed little interest in the off-and-on sun however, and 
; soon took up cozy residence on their favorite chairs, which 
; happen to also be my favorite chairs.  The fractal people were 
; also snug and cozy, but this is because the heating bills have 
; not yet arrived.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a day or two, or maybe three.  
; Until whenever, take care, and how many can see that we are 
; being kicked around emotionally by the media like a bull with a 
; ring in its nose?  BTW, all those who feel too much anxiety 
; because of all the doomsday shows on TV should distract 
; themselves from their worries by buying and using the sponsor's 
; products.
; 
; (BTW, just wait until big govermnent or big corporations begin 
; controlling and censoring the internet.)
