; FOTD -- January 10, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the northern branch of the Seahorse Valley 
; of an oversized Mandelbrot set corrupted in its depths by Z^9 
; energies.  It lies at a depth where ninth-order elements predomi-
; nate close to the minibrots, while quadratic elements prevail 
; farther out, and the in-between areas are a confused but interes-
; ting mix of Z^2 and Z^9 elements, but with no discontinuities.
; 
; The image abounds with smaller order-9 minibrots, the most 
; obvious of which lie at the upper left and lower right edges of 
; the scene.  I checked these minibrots and found them much the 
; same as the large one in today's image, though somewhat more 
; chaotic.
; 
; The name of the image is paradoxical.  I named it "Image With No 
; Name" because I could think of nothing better.  But this still 
; identifies the image, so I guess it's up to the wise philoso-
; phers and logicians to decide if the image actually has a name.
; 
; The art and math both rate a 7, which is good enough but leaves 
; plenty room for improvement.  The calculation time of 4 minutes 
; is slow however, and could give impatience a chance to arise.  
; The web sites can eliminate this threat.
; 
; The completely calculated image is available online at:

; 
; Two inches (5cm) of snow fell overnight here at Fractal Central, 
; but ended before daybreak.  The rest of the day was cloudy with 
; a temperature of 36F +2C.  The fractal cats noticed the fresh 
; cat footprints in the new snow, then settled down for a day of 
; tussling, eating and sleeping.  The fractal humans were happy to 
; have made it through another day and week.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in either one or two days, depen-
; ding on how much of an antiquing expedition happens tomorrow.  
; Until whenever, take care, and I wonder why the existence of 
; global warming has become such a big political debate.  The 
; earth certainly is getting warmer.  It has been for thousands 
; of years, and there is nothing we can do to stop it by passing 
; meaningless laws.
; 
; For some strange reason, I suspect that a potential transfer of 
; money is involved.
