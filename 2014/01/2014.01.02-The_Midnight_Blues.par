; FOTD -- January 02, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's scene lies in the fractal solar-system that results when 
; the formula Z^(2.5)+C is iterated 18 levels up the hyperladder 
; with no function applied to the calculation.  I call this parent 
; fractal a solar-system because it consists of a scattering of 
; minor fractals surrounding a large central fractal.  Today's 
; scene is located deep in a valley in a large minor fractal just 
; southeast of the main fractal.
; 
; The name "The Midnight Blues" does not refer to a state of 
; depression.  It is the first thing that popped into my mind when 
; I emptied it of all other thought, which some say is my usual 
; mental state.
; 
; The art rating of 7 indicates that I see some worth in the 
; image.  The math rating of a 5 shows that the math trick has 
; produced many fractals in the past, some of which are notably 
; better than today's.
; 
; The calculation time of 5-3/4 minutes might be slow enough to 
; give boredom and the resulting blues a chance to arise.  Here is 
; where the web sites can be a real 'upper'.
; 
; Beat the blues by checking the finished image at:

; 
; The day began cloudy here at Fractal Central.  Snow began at 
; 1pm, with up to 8 inches expected by midnight.  The temperature 
; reached a high of 30F -1C at noon, but fell steadily through the 
; afternoon to a forecast low tonight of 0F -18C.  The fractal 
; cats, who prefer snug warm comfort, watched the flakes for a few 
; minutes before snuggling up in their warm blankets.  The humans 
; also enjoy comfort, but they know that the world is fickle and 
; often unfair, and personal desires are not always fulfilled on 
; request.
; 
; The wishes for more fractals will be granted however.  In fact, 
; the next one will be posted in about 24 hours at this same spot. 
; Until then, take care, and God is sometimes fickle in fulfilling 
; worthy requests, but the FOTD has fulfilled the desire for free 
; fractals for almost 17 years.  (Does this make me more generous 
; than God, or merely a hypocritical boaster who will some day 
; face the divine wrath?)
