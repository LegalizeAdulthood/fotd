; FOTD -- January 29, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-no rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's Mandelbrot set scene lies deep in yesterday's 
; Hypermandelbrot image.  Only the few Hypermandelbrot parts of 
; the parent fractal have been omitted.  
; 
; In my opinion, the art rates a 7, being held down by coloring 
; that is a bit too chaotic.  I declined to rate the math, since 
; the formula, Z^2+C, is the most basic of all fractal formulas 
; and has been overused to near infinity.
; 
; The name "The Upper Magnitude" refers to the relatively high 
; magnitude of the scene.  This high magnitude requires arbitrary 
; precision math however, which makes the image a very slow one, 
; requiring almost a half-hour to complete.  But here is where the 
; web sites shine by eliminating the need to calculate the image.

; 
; The sky here at Fractal Central today was as clear and blue as 
; it ever gets anywhere, but the daybreak temperature of -4F -20C 
; kept all thoughts of spring far away.  The afternoon high of 19F 
; -7C was a little better, but nowhere near making Central Pennsyl-
; vania a balmy midwinter resort.  Fractal cat Nico gave Jazzy a 
; good cussing when she wanted to play and he didn't, but it 
; didn't bother her very much, since she soon found a slip of 
; paper to tear apart.  The fractal humans had a reasonable day, 
; which is only human.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted sooner rather than later.  So fight 
; ambiguity by checking back frequently.  Until whenever, take 
; care, and what could we call an Atheist who does believe in God?
