; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- January 05, 2014 (Rating A-6,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is found in the everyday parent fractal that 
; results when the formula Z^(2.001)+C is iterated 4.7 levels up 
; the hyperladder with no function applied.  This parent is a 
; near-Mandelbrot set rotated 180 degrees so that East Valley 
; falls on the negative X-axis, and the main spike, where even 
; more action is happening, lies on the positive X-axis.
; 
; Today we focus our attention on East Valley, which instead of 
; coming to a sharp point, has been broadened into a wedge 
; infested with sickle-shaped debris.  Today's scene lies in this 
; debris.
; 
; The coloring is rather chaotic, and both the art and math tricks 
; have been seen before, which holds the ratings of both of them 
; to a routine 6.
; 
; The name "Herringbone Filters" has nothing to do with the field 
; of TV repair.  It came to mind when something in the scene 
; reminded me of herringbones.
; 
; Most of the coloring effect was produced by rendering the scene 
; with the outside set to 'tdis'.  Other options produce different 
; effects, some of which have potential.
; 
; The calculation time of a dragging 11-1/2 minutes will pass 
; slowly even for the most devout fractal fans.  But relief is 
; always at hand on the web sites.
; 
; To view the image without calculating it, check the FOTD web 
; sites at:

; 
; The morning was sunny here at Fractal Central today.  But clouds 
; moved in by noon and by mid-afternoon freezing rain was falling, 
; with a temperature of 28F -2C.  The fractal cats were too busy 
; chasing each other up and down the hallway and tussling to worry 
; themselves with the weather.  The fractal humans were simply 
; glad there was no reason to go out.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a matter of minutes, which will 
; also be a matter of seconds, hours, weeks, months or years, 
; depending on how time is measured.  To find the exact numbers, 
; check back at regular intervals.  Until whenever, take care, and 
; a local eight-year-old boy was recently asked what was the best 
; thing that happened to him in 2013.  He replied it was when he 
; got his mini I-pad for Christmas.
