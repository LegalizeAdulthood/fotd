; FOTD -- January 24, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies deep inside a minibrot in Scepter Valley the 
; Hypermandelbrot set, in an area that should be a total blank.  
; I named it "Hyper-Mandel Scene" for obvious reasons.
; 
; Do not ask me what the image shows or how the math works.  None 
; of it makes any sense.  But the image certainly is real and it 
; looks pretty good for something that makes no sense.
; 
; The number of elements in the features circling the center 
; increases in increments of two as we dive deeper into the 
; bottomless center of the enclosing minibrot.  But why does the 
; number not redouble at every step?  And if the number of 
; elements reflects the periodicity of the area of the M-set in 
; which it lies, why does the number not stay the same as we look 
; deeper?
; 
; There are obviously some big questions to be answered about the 
; things done by the HyperMandelbrot2 formula, so I'll probably be 
; investigating the 4-D hypermandelbrot set for quite a while.  In 
; fact, the next virtually impossible wonder will appear as the 
; next FOTD.
; 
; As I see it, the art aspect of today's image is worth a 7, while 
; the math aspect remains at quite a high level, which today is a 
; rating of 9.
; 
; The calculation time of today's image is 5-1/3 minutes, on the 
; slow side indeed.  This slowness is largely caused by the need 
; to turn off the periodicity when using the HyperMandelbrot2 
; formula.  But all is not lost, for the web sites are always 
; there to bring near instant relief.
;

; sites at:

; 
; Today brought lots of sun to Fractal Central, but the morning 
; low temperature of +3F -16C and paltry afternoon high of 19F -7C 
; made the sun pretty much ineffective at bringing outdoor 
; comfort.  The fractal cats however had a pleasant day indoors, 
; enjoying and sharing the sun on their shelf.  The humans made 
; out as best they could.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in due time.  Until whenever that 
; might be, take care, and think about what the 'news' media is 
; really doing with our emotions when it says things like 'should 
; you be worried about....'
