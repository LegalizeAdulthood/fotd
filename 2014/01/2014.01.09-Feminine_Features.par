; FOTD -- January 09, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene I found in a distorted Mandelbrot set 
; corrupted all the way through by Z^(1.001) energies.  The East 
; Valley area of this parent fractal is shrunken out of sight, 
; while the main spike area is blown up like a balloon.  A large 
; bay lies between the extremes, with today's scene located near a 
; kind of knot at the tip of a filament extending from a small bud 
; on the northern shore line of this large main bay.
; 
; I named the image "Feminine Features" because of the shades of 
; pink.  It is a strange name because I usually avoid the lacy, 
; flowery, pink stuff found in shops that specialize in feminine 
; things.  (FL has no such aversion, but that's her problem, not 
; mine.)
; 
; The art rating of a 7 might have been a point or so higher if I 
; had given more attention to the colors and brightened them up a 
; little.  The math rating of a 7 shows that I was rather sur-
; prised at the things Z^(1.001) corruption can do to a Mandelbrot 
; set.
; 
; The calculation time of 2 minutes is right on the mark for such 
; an image.  It's just enough time to leave the room, pour a 
; drink, and get back to the computer.  Checking the image on the 
; web sites will save the hike.

; 
; Today brought a big improvement to Fractal Central, with cloud-
; less skies, brilliant sunshine, and a temperature of 27F -3C, 
; which was still well under the freezing point, but with light 
; winds felt almost like a day in early spring.  The fractal cats 
; welcomed the sun on their window shelf, but couldn't decide who 
; would get the top-cat spot.  The fractal people simply made it 
; through another day.  Hey, life is no soap opera, so don't 
; expect constant, ever more interesting, storm and stress.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted before too long.  Until whenever, 
; take care, and I hear that God is infinitely forgiving and 
; merciful -- as long as we are still alive, that is.  But when we 
; die, watch out.  They say He turns into the most unforgiving, 
; vengeful being we could possibly imagine.
