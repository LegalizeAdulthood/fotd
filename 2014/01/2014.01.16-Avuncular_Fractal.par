; FOTD -- January 15, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Avuncular Fractal", which if taken 
; literally, would mean it relates to an uncle.  Actually the name 
; is pure nonsense, much like what some say about certain things I 
; sometimes write.  But what the heck!?!  Nonsense is what makes 
; life and fractals so interesting.
; 
; The generating expression combines 11 negative parts of Z^(-1.1) 
; with 1.1 negative parts of Z^(-11.1) before adding (1/C) on each 
; iteration.  The resulting parent fractal is a typical double 
; negative thing consisting of four vertically stacked bays with a 
; prominent 'fan' extending east from the origin.  Curving 
; filaments extend outward from these bays and terminate in a 
; series of rings.  Today's scene lies in the large southernmost 
; ring.
; 
; The rating of a 7 for both the art and math is not quite high 
; enough to make the 3-minute calculation time much of a bargain.  
; But the true bargain, with associated happiness, may be found on 
; the web sites.
; 
; Find happiness!  How?  By checking the finished image at:

; 
; The day began with heavy fog here at Fractal Central.  The fog 
; cleared away by mid-morning, but clouds moved in by noon, and 
; light rain began a couple hours later.  The fractal cats were 
; annoyed that the sun was obscured just as it was ready to shine 
; on their window shelf.  The humans, having nothing to be annoyed 
; about, made it through the day with minimum angst.
; 
; There is a 90-percent chance that next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  The chance will increase to 100 percent when it actually 
; does appear.  Until then, take care, and when I was in school we 
; never heard of school shootings, nor did we flood the school 
; with grief counselors when two students were killed in drunk 
; driving accidents.  We either care a lot more nowadays or our 
; students are turning into angry wimps.
