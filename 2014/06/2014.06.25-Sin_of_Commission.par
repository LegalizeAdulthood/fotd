; FOTD -- June 24, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Sin of Commission", but don't expect any 
; subliminal racy scenes in the image.  The name refers to the 
; color intensification of the image, which I did in an outside 
; color program.  Since I sometimes consider such superfluous 
; image manipulation to be cheating, I have admitted my sin in the 
; name I gave the image.  The questionable manipulation did raise 
; the color rating from a 5 to an 8 however, so maybe my misdeed 
; was not as bad as implied.
; 
; The math aspect rates a 5 however, and there is no way to raise 
; it.  The scene lies deep in East Valley of the large minibrot on 
; the main spike of the Mandelbrot set, an area that has been 
; thoroughly explored at least down to the depth of over 10^14 of 
; today's image.
; 
; Since arbitrary precision math is necessary at this depth, the 
; image is a slow one, taking around 20 minutes on a SOTA unit.  
; But all is not lost, for the 20 minute wait may be avoided by 
; checking the image on the web sites.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:

; 
; Partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 86F 30C, along with 
; high humidity, kept today on the muggy side here at Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cats kept their eyes on the pigeons that 
; have found their way into the porch roof, while the humans made 
; sure the other things were under control.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a day or two.  Until then, take 
; care, and live without fear, for the aliens from Arcturus are 
; here to protect us.
