; FOTD -- June 29, 2014 (Rating A-6,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It has been 3 days since the most recent FOTD, but that's the 
; way of it sometimes.  After all, fractals are almost the most 
; important things in life, but not the most important.
; 
; Today's belated image shows an order-11 minibrot lying deep in 
; the chaos on the west side of the north branch of Seahorse 
; Valley of its grossly oversized parent Mandelbrot set.  The name 
; "A Stray Undekabrot" confirms this description.
; 
; I am becoming rather involved in investigating these higher-
; order fractals and their minibrots, though I have yet to concoct 
; a formula that brings the size of the parent fractal under 
; control in a satisfactory manner.  In fact the futile search for 
; a suitable formula is the main reason for the current irregular 
; schedule of the FOTD.
; 
; I could rate the art no higher than a 6 and the math interest no 
; higher than a 5.  The image is still worth a quick look however, 
; at least in my opinion.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-3/4 minutes is rather slow for an 
; image that rates a measly 6+5.  Here is where the web sites 
; charge to the rescue.
; 
; After waiting three days for further fractal satisfaction, why 
; wait any longer.  View the image instantly on the FOTD web sites

; 
; A near perfect partly cloudy summer day with a temperature of 
; 84F 29C passed uneventfully here at Fractal Central today.  The 
; two fractal cats, now almost impossible to tell apart from a 
; distance, took it easy most of the time.  The most excitement 
; happened when Jasmine got excited about a flock of butterflies 
; that appeared in the fractal garden in the afternoon.  Luckily, 
; the fractal humans made it through the day without getting so 
; excited.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a day or a few.  Until whenever, 
; take care, and do we observe a world that is really out there, 
; or do we create the world by our act of observing it?  Goofy 
; occultists and rational quantum scientists both say things that 
; imply that we create the world as we observe it, though the 
; scientists, who must maintain an air of reason and respectabil-
; ity, cannot state such apparently irrational things outright.
