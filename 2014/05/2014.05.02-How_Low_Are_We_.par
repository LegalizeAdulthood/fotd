; FOTD -- May 02, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The name of today's image asks a question -- "How Low Are We?"  
; The real(p1) parameter answers that question.  The exponent of Z 
; in today's image lies at the lowly level of 1.067, a level where 
; fractals would normally be assumed to be virtually impossible, 
; much less filled with minibrots.  But thanks to the overworked 
; MandelbrotBC3, which calculates the multiple values of the 
; complex-log function, we have not only a fractal, but a rather 
; exciting minibrot.
; 
; The parent fractal resembles an orca swimming freely through its 
; natural habitat, the ocean.  The fractal orca is surrounded by a 
; cloud of sandy debris that could be bubbles.  Today's scene is 
; located in this bubble debris, to the lower left of the orca.
; 
; The minibrot in today's image is shaped like a plunging rocket 
; ship, not at all like the orca shape of its parent.  Almost all 
; minibrots in this ultra-low range of exponents of Z are shaped 
; like rockets or torpedoes, but this does not mean the scenes are 
; worthless.  The features surrounding the minibrots can sometimes 
; be surprising.
; 
; The art worth of today's image rates a 7.  In my opinion, the 
; art aspect is notably above average, held up by its brilliant 
; coloring.  The math rating of an 8 points to the surprise of 
; finding a minibrot in a fractal with an exponent of Z as low as 
; 1.067.  And this is not the lowest possible exponent that would 
; produce a fractal with minibrots.  Like all things fractal, 
; there is no well-defined cut-off point below which fractals with 
; minibrots are impossible.  Finding them simply becomes ever more 
; difficult until the fractalist simply stops his search.
; 
; The maxiter of today's image is 420,000, which results in a 
; calculation time of 7-1/2 minutes.  This is a good example of 
; the increasing difficulty as the exponent approaches unity.  And 
; even with this extreme value, the minibrot is far from fully 
; resolved.  Luckily, the web sites are there to bring relief.
; 
; So escape fractal drudgery.  Check the finished image at:

; 
; Today brought a mix of clouds and sun, brisk winds and a 
; temperature of 61F 16C to Fractal Central.  The fractal cats, 
; now quite difficult to tell apart from a distance, had a playful 
; day.  The humans had a work day.  The next FOTD will be delayed 
; until May 4, two days from now.  Until then, take care, and I 
; just found a mind hiding under the stairs.  Did anyone lose 
; theirs?
