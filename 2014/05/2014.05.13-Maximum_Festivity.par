; FOTD -- May 13, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image came about when I combined negative (1/Z) with 
; negative (Z) and added (1/C) on each iteration.  This expression 
; has two critical values, +2 and zero.  Both critical values 
; produce similar fractals, which are oriented 180 degrees apart.
; 
; Both parent fractals resemble the east parts of Mandelbrot sets 
; with the main bud and spike cut off by flat disks.  Today's 
; scene lies in the chaos along the northern edge of the parent 
; that results when Z is initialized to the critical value of zero 
; by setting real(p4) to -2.
; 
; I named the image "Maximum Festivity" because of the riot of 
; overly brilliant colors, which were mostly produced by rendering 
; the image with the 'outside' set to 'tdis'.  In fact, these 
; garish colors hold down the art rating to an unexceptional 7.  
; The math rates a 7 also, mostly because of the non-zero setting 
; of the real(p4) parameter.
; 
; The image takes a solid 2-1/2 minutes to finish, not so bad as 
; fractals go, but even more time can be saved by checking the web 
; sites.
; 
; The finished image is online at:

; 
; Today brought a mix of clouds and sun, and a temperature of 90F 
; 32C, to Fractal Central.  The fractal cats thought it was a 
; little too warm for comfort, while the fractal humans thought it 
; was just right.  The next FOTD will be posted in a day or two, 
; or possibly three.
; 
; Until the next FOTD appears, take care, and don't be misled by 
; conservative deniers of climate change, (aka global warming).  
; The world-wide weather records show that it is a fact.  And at 
; the same time don't get caught up in the progressive frenzy to 
; pass new legislation in the name of fighting climate change.
; 
; Since the climate doesn't obey man-made laws, passing new laws 
; would amount to nothing more than feeling good while satisfying 
; various political and economic agendas.  With our current lack 
; of technology, hedonistic life style, and so many nations 
; developing, there is nothing we would be willing or able to do 
; that would stop or even slow the warm-up.  It would be far 
; better not to economically cripple ourselves and to use our 
; resources to prepare for the challenges of the warmer planet to 
; come.
