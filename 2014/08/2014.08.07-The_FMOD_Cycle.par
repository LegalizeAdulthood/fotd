; 
; NEW FORMULA!!
; 
; Today's formula is another new one.  Forget about the ersatz 
; 'new' formula posted on August 4th, which has already been 
; discarded.

; 
; Given impetus by Hal Lane, I decided to see how much I could 
; simplify the BC formulas and still get the same fractals.  
; Today's formula is about as far as I could take the process.  
; When I analyzed the old formulas, I was surprised at how many 
; terms simply canceled out or had no effect.  Today's new formula 
; is the result.  The by-product is a 33-percent increase in speed.
; 
; I named today's image "The FMOD Cycle" mostly because the image 
; was rendered with the inside set to 'FMOD'.  The cycle part of 
; the name refers to the complex logarithmic hyperspiral of the 
; Z^sqrt(2)+C fractal, which, starting at zero, repeats every 
; 4.442... levels.  Today's image is located 2.221... levels up 
; the hyperspiral, which is exactly halfway back to the starting 
; point and produces a parent fractal with X-axis symmetry.
; 
; The art worth of the image impresses me as a 7; the math rates 
; an 8, which is perhaps overblown.  After all, the basic math is 
; old stuff.  Only the streamlined formula is new.
; 
; Today's image is the actual parent fractal, made somewhat 
; unrecognizable by the 'FMOD' inside fill.  This is why it 
; calculates in a matter of 22 seconds.  If this is still too 
; slow, the web sites can make things a bit speedier.

; 
; A mix of puffy clouds and blue sky, a temperature of 79F 26C, a 
; passing afternoon shower, refreshing low humidity, and a gentle 
; north wind made today a day worth waiting for here at Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cats missed much of the day when they 
; slept all afternoon.  The fractal humans had an uneventful 
; though busy day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the appropriate time.  Until 
; whenever this might be, take care, and the governments tell the 
; people what they can and cannot do, the big corporations tell 
; the governments what to order the people to do, but who tells 
; the big corporations what to tell the governments to order?
