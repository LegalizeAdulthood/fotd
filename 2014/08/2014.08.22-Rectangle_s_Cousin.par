; FOTD -- August 22, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In the Z^(2.003) Mandeloid there are curious rectangles near the 
; X-axis just east of the large minibrot, which are especially 
; prominent in the Julia sets of the area.  Today I wondered what 
; exists in this same area of the Z^(2.002) Mandeloid.
; 
; What I found is a kind of proto-rectangle, filled with a slew of 
; intricate and quite decorative detail.  As is the case with the 
; Z^(2.003) rectangle, a tiny change in the 'C' value makes a 
; great change in the image.  Today's image shows one of the more 
; impressive aspects of this protorectangle.
; 
; The reason for the name "Rectalgle's Cousin" is obvious.  The 
; calculation time of a zippy 35 seconds will pass in a flash and 
; a half.  And as always, calculation may be totally avoided by 
; checking the web sites.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:

; 
; After a torrential thunder-storm yesterday, which flooded the 
; basement of the local city hall, today was much calmer here at 
; Fractal Central, with partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 
; 81F 27C.  The three fractal cats, (Nicholas and Jasmine have 
; been joined by a four-month-old kitten probably named Lida.), 
; spent most of the afternoon resting after spending the morning 
; becoming more familiar with one another.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in due time.  Until the time is 
; due, take care, and why can't I shake the nagging impression 
; that the U.S. government itself is responsible for much of the 
; continuing unrest in the world, especially the Middle East?
