; FOTD -- August 25, 2014 (Rating A-5,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image might not be the best of all time, but it does 
; show what happens to spirals in fractals of very low order.  The 
; parent fractal is the Z^(1.1)+C Mandeloid.  At ground level this 
; Mandeloid is little more than a tiny kidney bean, but when 
; sliced at a level 0.5 turns up the hyperspiral, it opens up into 
; a giant torpedo-shaped bay surrounded by scads of interesting 
; details.  Just north of the main torpedo lies a chaotic spiral, 
; which is rather hard to pick out.  Today's scene lies deep in 
; this spiral.
; 
; I could give the art a rating no higher than a 5, while the math 
; rates a 6.
; 
; The calculation time could be the best feature of today's FOTD.  
; The 40-second wait is about as brief as calculation times come.  
; Of course, the web sites are always online to make the viewing 
; even simpler.
; 
; The finished image for all it's worth is posted online at:

; 
; Absolutely perfect weather prevailed here at Fractal Central 
; today, with all parameters as near perfect as possible.  The 
; fractal cat trio is now pretty used to having the other two 
; around, though an occasional curse word does still slip out.  
; The humans, thankful that the newcomer fractal cat is being 
; accepted into the family, had a busy but otherwise uneventful 
; day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted within a reasonable time.  Until 
; reason prevails, take care, and there really are problems with 
; no solutions.
