; FOTD -- April 29, 2014 (Rating A-6,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's scene in the East Valley area of the Z^2+C Julibrot was 
; created by the 'ranges' feature of Fractint, a feature that I 
; very rarely use.  It is such a rarely used feature that I am not 
; even sure the more current Fractint-emulating programs have the 
; ability to reproduce it.  As far as I know, the 'ranges' feature 
; can be accessed only through a command-line entry.  The 'ranges' 
; instructions, which are rather complicated, are available in the 
; program documentation.
; 
; The image slices the Julibrot in an orientation halfway between 
; the Elliptic and Rectangular.  The vaguely elephant-shaped open 
; area in the foreground shows that we are roaming the East Valley 
; area.  The brilliantly blue bars in the background show that 
; regardless of where the points in the Mandelbrot set begin their 
; journeys, if they do not escape first, they will eventually 
; settle into the same orbits as points that begin at 0,0.  And if 
; we look closely, we can actually see the dull red, low iteration 
; foreground stuff gradually merging into the high iteration stuff 
; making up the horizontal blue bars in the background.
; 
; There is no problem with the colors section of the parameter 
; file.  Since the final 242 color registers are all solid black, 
; I have combined them into a single register to save space.
; 
; I named the image "The Fourth Dimension".  After all, the 
; Julibrot certainly does exist in four spatial dimensions.  The 
; art earns a rating of an acceptable 6, while the math, which 
; involves four dimensions, rates an improved 7.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-2/3 minutes is fast enough to keep 
; impatience under control and slow enough to give time to watch 
; the scene unfold on the screen.  But calculation is still a 
; chore, and this chore may be avoided by checking the finished 
; image on the web sites.

; 
; Clouds and rain made today a day to be forgotten here at Fractal 
; Central.  The temperature of 48F +9C did nothing at all to help 
; make the day more pleasant.  The fractal cats, who are now 
; getting hard to tell apart, spent a little time sulking about 
; the poor weather, but a lot of time working off their 
; dissatisfaction tussling with each other.  The humans spent the 
; day pondering the world's human problems.  The next FOTD will 
; likely be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and one 
; person can hardly worry about every over-hyped problem on earth.
