; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we return to a type of fractal I was working with quite a 
; few years ago.  The image is a scene in a perturbed Z^2+C 
; Mandelbrot set.  It is located at the edge of the inside of a 
; minor bud on the southwest shore line of the main bay.
; 
; The half obscured blue and white buds in the background are 
; actually part of the classic M-set itself.  The reddish spiral 
; arms in the foreground are the trails of points that have 
; escaped before being trapped in the remnants of the buds.
; 
; What we have here is a demonstration that the points in a 
; perturbed M-set, if they do not escape first, will ultimately 
; fall into the same orbits as points that originate at 0,0.  The 
; points in today's image for example originate at 0.7,0.2.
; 
; I named the image "Ghostly Attractor" because of the ghost buds 
; and also because despite my skeptical nature, I find ghosts 
; quite interesting and not at all unlikely to be 'real'.
; 
; The art rates a 7, since the image is not all that great.  The 
; math rates a 4.  After all, how unique can the math of the 
; Mandelbrot set be at this point of the fractal era.
; 
; The calculation time of just under 2 minutes is slow for a scene 
; in the Mandelbrot set.  The culprit is the maxiter of 250000, 
; which slows things down in the lower part of the image, but this 
; maxiter was necessary to get full definition in the ghost buds.  
; The web sites can greatly cut the length of the wait to see the 
; image however.
; 
; Escape the life of endless waiting.  Check the finished image on 
; the FOTD web sites at:

; 
; Today here at Fractal Central, which is the almost-real central 
; headquarters of the FOTD, spring gave signs that it was finally 
; ready to arrive.  The brilliant sun, gentle winds, puffy white 
; clouds and temperature of 61F 16C was just what any doctor would 
; have ordered.  The fractal cats soaked up all the sun they could 
; find, and chased each other up and down the hallway when the sun 
; was at the wrong angle, while the fractal humans made the most 
; of the pleasant conditions.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted before too long.  Until that moment 
; of truth arrives, take care, and try to avoid the cognitive 
; instability that arises when we assume something that undermines 
; the argument that justified our assumption in the first place.
