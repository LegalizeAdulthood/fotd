; FOTD -- April 18, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in a parent Mandelbrot set corrupted by 
; Z^(0.9) energies.  In this case, the corruption extends all the 
; way to the parent's surface, where it splits the main spike into 
; fractal chaos.  Today's scene is located very close to the 
; X-axis in some of this chaos just west of the split-apart large 
; minibrot.
; 
; I named the image "Sandy Scenery" because of the well-defined 
; area of near total chaos surrounding the minibrot lying at the 
; center of the scene, well beyond the reach of Fractint .
; 
; I have rated both the art and math aspects at an 8.  I really 
; did put extra effort into the coloring.  And the math is kind of 
; a mystery.  It is far from obvious why corruption energies less 
; than two have such a dramatic effect on even the surface of the 
; parent M-set, and also why the minibrots of the corrupted parent 
; remain quadratic and do not morph into lower-order ones.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-2/3 minutes is fast enough to prevent 
; impatience or boredom from arising, but life can still be made 
; simpler by avoiding calculation completely and checking the 
; finished image on the web sites.
; 
; For maximum convenience, the image has already been calculated 
; and posted to the FOTD web sites at:

; 
; Clouds prevailed all day here at Fractal Central, but they were 
; thin enough to let a trace of sunlight through.  The fractal 
; cats, who wanted more than just a trace, were spotted crouched 
; in their cat sulk positions several times during the afternoon.  
; The humans, who would have preferred a temperature higher than 
; 54F 12C, took what they could get.
; 
; The next FOTD will likely not be posted until April 20.  Until 
; the moment of bliss arrives, take care, and it's getting so 
; confusing that a person can't tell the good aliens from the bad 
; ones without a program.
