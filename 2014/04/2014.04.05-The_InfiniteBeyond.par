; FOTD -- April 05, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image came about when I subtracted 2 parts of Z^(1.5) 
; from 2 parts of Z^(2.5) and added C on each iteration.  This 
; simple combination produces a parent fractal vaguely resembling 
; a Mandelbrot set with its west half split apart, leaving two 
; prominent period-2 buds.  The western shore line between these 
; buds consists of all new stuff, with today's image lying in this 
; new stuff, close to the valley leading to the northern period-2 
; bud.
; 
; The terraced effect was created by the 'tdis' outside option.
; 
; The name "The Infinite Beyond" could be true of any fractal, 
; since almost all fractals continue on forever, without limit.
; 
; The art rating of a 7 is a come-down from recent efforts, but 
; still makes the image worth a look.
; 
; The main drawback is the admittedly slow calculation time of 9 
; minutes.  A much easier way to see the image may be found on the 
; web sites.
; 
; This easy life may be enjoyed by checking the finished image at:

; 
; Today here at Fractal Central began with clouds and blustery 
; winds.  The clouds broke in the afternoon though the winds 
; continued through the day, making the temperature of 43F +6C 
; feel like anything but spring.  The fractal cats would have 
; preferred more sun; the humans took what they could get.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted soon.  Until whenever, take care, 
; and the things that modern physicists are theorizing seem more 
; incredible than the wildest claims of the old-time pseudoscien-
; tific charlatans.  In fact, with all the quantum and multiverse 
; stuff that can never be observed or tested, I sometimes wonder 
; if the work of modern physicists can still be considered a 
; legitimate aspect of the traditional scientific method.  Perhaps 
; we need an entirely new discipline, which considers unobservable 
; things (and why not spirits also) to be as real as the material 
; we see around us.  Then we might join the discipline with 
; traditional mysticism and name it something like mystiscience.
