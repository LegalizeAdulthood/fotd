; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- April 25, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the parent fractal that results when 0.01 
; part of Z^(2) is subtracted from Z^(-2) on each iteration.  This 
; parent is gargantuan in size, though the unlikely escape radius 
; of today's image cuts off most of it.
; 
; This odd escape radius of 99.999 was carefully chosen to bring 
; the scene of today's action as close as possible to the cutoff 
; point, where the bubbles created by the 'fmod' outside option 
; are as prominent as possible.
; 
; The name "Koilon Bubbles" describes the bubble-like objects in 
; the image, and points back to the time when empty space was 
; assumed to be filled with an invisible substance called aether, 
; which transmitted light waves.  Some people, mostly occultists 
; who called the aether 'koilon', also assumed that atoms were 
; actually made of bubbles in this all-pervading substance that 
; were held open by the creative power.  Curiously, now that dark 
; energy has come on the scene, this idea does not seem quite as 
; goofy as when it was seemingly disproved by the theory of 
; relativity.
; 
; The art rating of an 8 is thoroughly earned, since I spent over 
; an hour working up the custom coloring.  The math rating of a 7 
; is earned because the un-truncated parent fractal extends 
; apparently infinitely in both the outward and inward directions.
; 
; The calculation takes 1-1/2 minutes -- fast enough to keep 
; boredom at bay.  And the web sites can avoid all calculation 
; problems.
; 
; Save a little effort by viewing the finished image on any one of 
; the FOTD web sites at:

; 
; Morning sun gave way to afternoon clouds and evening rain here 
; at Fractal Central today.  The temperature of 64F 18C was very 
; near normal.  The fractal cats were too busy tussling with each 
; other to care very much about the outside conditions, though I 
; did hear Jasmine chattering when a pigeon landed near the 
; window.  The humans, who are becoming ever more disgusted with 
; politics and the mass media, had an average day.  The next FOTD 
; will be delayed until April 27, two days from now.  Until that 
; time arrives, take care, and beware of manipulative media 
; exaggerations.
