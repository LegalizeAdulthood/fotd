; FOTD -- April 22, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Broken Perfection".  The reason for the 
; name is readily apparent in the image, which shows an almost 
; perfect ring around a minibrot.  The ring resembles a donut-
; shaped planetary nebula puffed off from a dying star, but look 
; closer.  The ring is broken on its east side by a discontinuity 
; that is caused by the fractional nature of the Z^(10.5) exponent 
; and extends all the way to the central minibrot.
; 
; The 9-1/2 bays of the minibrot point to an exponent of 10.5, 
; while the 10-1/2 elements in the ring confirm the deduction.
; 
; The location of the scene is at the edge of a larger but still 
; order-10.5 minibrot on the main spike of the parent Mandelbrot 
; set, just east of the prominent large quadratic minibrot.
; 
; The art rates a 7, mostly due to the modicum of extra effort I 
; put into the coloring.  I could rate the math aspect no higher 
; than a 6, especially after noting that we have been exploring 
; this math trick for over a week.
; 
; The calculation time of merely forty seconds makes up for any 
; deficiencies however.  This time will pass faster than Ali 
; Baba's forty thieves.  But there is no danger, since the web 
; sites will keep the thieves at bay, at least for those who 
; choose to take shelter there.

; 
; Heavy clouds and light rain spoiled things here at Fractal 
; Central today until the sun broke through in mid-afternoon.  The 
; temperature of 68F 20C was mild enough, but with the house heat 
; turned down, the fractal cats would have preferred more sun.  
; The humans had a thoughtful day.  While I was out walking, I 
; noticed that the trees in the town square are still as bare and 
; bleak as in midwinter, and it's only one week until the month of 
; May, when trees are usually in full leaf.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours or whenever.  Until 
; then, take care, and at this Easter time I hear of a decline in 
; religious faith.  The decline is nothing new, but could it be 
; driven by the fact that among the over-educated, religious faith 
; is widely seen as a vestige, which is now little more than a 
; comforting diversion from reality clung to by the under-educated 
; and easily disproved by scientific study and rational thought?
