; FOTD -- March 14, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a dive into yesterday's image, where we find 
; that the butterflies are not at all as elusive as they appeared 
; 24 hours ago.  In fact, it took very little time to turn up 
; today's scene, which lies along the X-axis of yesterday's 
; fractal and shows an order-7 minibrot surrounded by no less than 
; seven butterflies.  The name "Seven Butterflies" was obvious.
; 
; The art and math ratings of 7 and 6 are little changed from 
; yesterday, which is no big surprise.  The color palette is 
; largely picked up from yesterday's image, with only a bit of 
; tweaking.  The calculation time of a little below three minutes 
; will pass swiftly enough, and may be eliminated entirely by 
; checking the web sites.
; 
; The finished image is posted online at:

; 
; Today began cloudy and dreary here at Fractal Central, but the 
; clouds cleared away at lunch time, leading to a very pleasant 
; sunny afternoon with a temperature of 50F 10C.  The mature 
; fractal cat spent the afternoon sunning himself on the window 
; shelf, while the fractal kitten spent the day in her room, still 
; recovering from her talk with the doctor.  Thankfully, she has 
; only three more days of confinement to get through.  The fractal 
; humans made it through the day with nothing happening that was 
; worth mentioning, that is unless one considers paying a pile of 
; bills worth mentioning.
; 
; The next FOTD fractal will be posted in 24 hours, with a 
; probability of 80 percent.  Until then, take care, and I hear 
; that the flood of technological gadgets is causing some big 
; problems among younger people.  I guess we need to come up with 
; more and better gadgets to solve the problems.
