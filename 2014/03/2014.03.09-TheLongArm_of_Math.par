; 
; FOTD -- March 08, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the parent fractal that results 
; when the formula Z^(1.3)+C is iterated one small step up the 
; hyperladder with no function applied.  This parent consists of a 
; large bay shaped somewhat like a half-moon, with a few minor 
; bays around the edges and a field of cross-shaped filaments 
; extending to the south.  Today's scene lies near the southern 
; edge of this field of filaments.
; 
; The effect of an island in the middle of nowhere was achieved by 
; rendering the image with the logmap set too high and coloring 
; the very large area covered by the 001 register total black.  
; This took a little extra work, which raised the art rating to a 
; 7.  The math rating scores only a 6.  I can see nothing very new 
; or unique in the math aspect.
; 
; The name "The Long Arm of Math" refers to the unusually long 
; main filament extending northeast from the oddly shaped order 
; 1.3 minibrot at the center.
; 
; The image calculates in 55 seconds, which will pass unbelievably 
; fast.  Those who still cannot believe may find calculation 
; relief on the FOTD web sites.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:

; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
;   <http://user.xmission.com/~legalize/fractals/fotd/about.html>
; 
; The official web site will be back in operation in a few days.
; 
; Clouds spoiled today here at Fractal Central, though the mild 
; temperature of 50F +10C prevented a total loss.  The new fractal 
; cat Jasmine remained confined to her room with a collar around 
; her neck.  The old fractal cat Nicholas wondered what was wrong 
; with her.  The humans simply took it as easy as possible.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the not-too-distant future.  
; Until whenever, take care, and our president says this is the 
; 21st century and the world has moved beyond the days when one 
; nation can impose its will on another nation by force.  So do as 
; the U.S. says, not as it does.
