; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- March 18, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the East Valley of a skeletized 
; Mandeloid in the parent fractal that results when a Mandelbrot 
; set is corrupted by (1/Z) energies.  This parent has other 
; Mandeloids strung along its X-axis, some of which could be quite 
; interesting.
; 
; The art and math aspects both rate a 7.  I think the image is at 
; least a little above average, even though the name "A Bad Case 
; of Zits" is not likely to enhance the artistic impression.  But 
; don't blame me for the name.  I'm only reporting what I saw in 
; the image.
; 
; The zits can be made larger or smaller by changing the real(p2) 
; parameter.  Increasing its value makes the zits smaller; 
; decreasing the value makes them larger.  But don't go too far in 
; either direction.  Things could get totally out of control.
; 
; The calculation time of just over 2 minutes is fair enough.  
; It's too bad that real life zits can't be banished this quickly.
; 
; The finished image is posted online at:

; 
; The day began cloudy and dreary here at Fractal Central, but the 
; clouds cleared away shortly after midday, leading to a very 
; pleasant afternoon with a temperature of 45F +7C.  The fractal 
; cats took turns enjoying the sun on the shelf, both wishing the 
; other would choose another non-activity, while the humans, no 
; longer sure whether they are liberal or conservative, or whether 
; there is any difference, pondered the world situation.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the proper time, which most 
; often means the next day.  Until whenever, take care, and I just 
; watched the second in the TV series of 'Cosmos' remakes.  The 
; message I got from the program is that, in the dispute over the 
; thoreies of intelligent design versus random natural selection, 
; the natural selection theory is the winner, at least in the 
; rationalist camp.  My advice to the series producers is to make 
; their agenda a little less obvious and find some background 
; music that could put a little more spirit into their series.  Of 
; course, I'm not sure that rational skeptics want anything to do 
; with spirits.
