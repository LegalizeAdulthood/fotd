; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- March 06, 2014 (Rating A-8.5,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's striking image lies in a parent Mandelbrot set that is 
; corrupted by Z^(4.95) energies.  This corruption causes the main 
; negative spike to split into an infinitely divided series of 
; straight and curved filaments.  The scene of today's image lies 
; close to the X-axis near the eastern side of the large distorted 
; minibrot on the negative spike.
; 
; I feel that the art rating of 8.5 is justified because of the 
; time I put into the coloring.  The math rating of 7 is justified 
; by the fractional nature of the corruption exponent, which 
; causes an entirely different type of distortion to appear even 
; on the surface of the parent.  But so far, I have investigated 
; such fractals to only a minor degree.
; 
; The name "Strawberry Fractal" describes the impression created 
; by the colors when I first saw them.  The fireball calculation 
; time of only 40 seconds continues the trend of high-speed 
; parameter files of the past several days.  The web sites can 
; eliminate the task of setting up and running the parameter file.
;

; The official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; is currently having technical problems, but will hopefully soon 
; be up and running again.
; 
; Hazy sunshine prevailed all day here at Fractal Central today, 
; while the temperature started at a bone-chilling +7F -14C and 
; rose to only a very winterish 25F -4C.  The new fractal cat 
; Jasmine spent the day at the doctor's office, where she had a 
; long talk about the facts of cat life.  She will be back home 
; tomorrow to recover from her talk.  The old fractal cat Nicholas 
; was puzzled about the absence of his new playmate, and spent the 
; day searching for her.  The humans spent the day concerned about 
; the new fractal cat's talk with the doctor.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in around a day.  Until then, take 
; care, and I see that Russia has 'invaded' The Ukraine.  I guess 
; the free world should retaliate and give Russia the same 
; penalties it gave the U.S. when the U.S. invaded Iraq.
