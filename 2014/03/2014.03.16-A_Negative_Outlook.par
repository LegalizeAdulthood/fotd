; FOTD -- March 16, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in a parent Mandelbrot set that has been 
; corrupted not only in its depths but also on its surface by 
; Z^(0.99) energies.  This parent is shaped like a featureless 
; empty circle, with a little bit of Mandelbrot stuff on its 
; western edge.  A large bud that is beginning to split apart lies 
; on this western edge, with two fractalized main spikes extending 
; out eastward from the bud.  Today's scene lies in some debris 
; between the two spikes, just east of the two large minibrots.
; 
; The name "A Negative Outlook" does not refer to an evening in a 
; now vanished old-style photo lab, surrounded by trays of 
; dangerous chemicals, nor does it imply a negative world view.  
; It refers to the location of today's scene on the negative 
; X-axis of the parent fractal.
; 
; I decoded to rate both the art and math aspects of today's image 
; at a 7.  They are both at least a little above average.
; 
; The calculation time of one minute is fast enough to make a trip 
; to the web sites not absolutely necessary, but the web sites are 
; always there to make life easier.
; 
; Save a bit of time anyway by checking the finished image at:

; 
; Increasing clouds and a temperature of 34F +1C made today seem 
; like a return to midwinter here at Fractal Central.  Fractal cat 
; Nicholas is becoming impatient for spring to arrive, while 
; Jasmine is becoming even more impatient to get her collar off 
; and get out of her room.  She has only one more day to wait.  
; The fractal humans made it through the day with a minimum of 
; distractions.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours give or take a few.  
; Until then, take care, and on a recent evening, while I was busy 
; complaining about something, FL told me to stop complaining, so 
; she could watch the squabbling on the TV romance show without 
; being distracted by my squabbling.  Women are probably a bigger 
; mystery than the quantum measurement problem.
