; FOTD -- March 30, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is the last in the series of hyperminibrot images. 
; It takes us as far as we can go into the HyperMandelbrot set 
; with the DOS Fractint program, which after 20 years or so of 
; supreme service is now far from state of the art.
; 
; A minibrot was once at this spot, but now it's gone.  It leaves 
; only its memory to carry on.  (To see the minibrot, change the 
; real(p3) parameter to zero, raise the maxiter to 8000, shut off 
; the logmap, shrink the view-window, and wait a few minutes.)
; 
; The name "Patterns in Nothing" indicates that a good part of the 
; image lies inside an originally empty area of the now-vanished 
; minibrot.
; 
; The outer edge of the fractal ring retains the eight elements of 
; the original minibrot, but the next ring inward has 30 elements, 
; which is followed by a ring of 14 elements and then at the very 
; center, a near-invisible ring of 6 elements.  The series seems 
; to cut each level in half and subtract the number one as it 
; progresses inward.  If this series continues, it would lead to a 
; ring of only 2 elements at the next inward level, and zero 
; elements at the level beyond that.  Unfortunately the next level 
; inward beyond the 6 is beyond resolution.
; 
; One of these days, some fractal math expert, which I am not, 
; might determine exactly what such an unlikely series means.  As 
; I see it, all the stuff in today's image might be nothing more 
; than artifacts of math imprecision.  If so, it still makes no 
; difference, since what we have on the screen is still a fractal.
; 
; The worth of the art aspect, at least in my opinion, is a very 
; high 8.  The math aspect rates an even higher 9.
; 
; The calculation time of 6-3/4 minutes is slow indeed, but relief 
; is available on the FOTD web sites.
; 
; Running the included parameter file is more fun; viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web sites listed below is more 
; efficient.

; 
; The day began with clouds and occasional sprinkles of rain here 
; at Fractal Central.  This situation continued through the 
; morning.  The rain grew heavier and steadier by noon, and 
; continued through much of the afternoon, with snowflakes mixing 
; in as the day progressed, while the temperature hung around 37F 
; +3C.  The fractal cats busied themselves watching the world go 
; by and complaining about the lack of sun.  We humans, also of a 
; fractal nature, had no need to take extraordinary steps to keep 
; ourselves busy.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted when it is.  For a more specific 
; schedule, check back here often.  Until next time, take care, 
; and keeping busy is an integral part of the hectic modern day 
; lifestyle, which is based on the scientific assumption that we 
; exist on earth only one brief moment, and therefore must grab 
; all the action we can before we go 'poof' like a wandering soap 
; bubble drifting in the night.
