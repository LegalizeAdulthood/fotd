; FOTD -- March 27, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Believe it or not, today's image has the same 'C' coordinates 
; in the Mandelbrot set as yesterday's.  But the appearance has 
; totally changed.  The central minibrot as well as everything 
; around it has vanished and been replaced by a series of 14 
; converging arms.
; 
; The reason for the change is the real(p3) parameter, which has 
; been raised from zero to 0.248 and thereby offset the slice ever 
; so slightly in one of the other six directions that are 
; perpendicular to the plane of the image in the 8-D Julibrot.
; 
; The name "Mystery Epicycles" refers to the 14 converging arms 
; that have replaced the minibrot.  The number 14 is strange 
; enough, but the next deeper series of converging arms, barely 
; visible at the center, numbers only six.  I have no idea what 
; determines these series, so they are still a big mystery.  BTW, 
; epicycles are what the strange retrograde motions of the planets 
; were called before we knew the nature of the solar system and 
; the laws of gravity.
; 
; The art aspect, which in my opinion is a little better than 
; yesterday's, rates a 7.  The math aspect reveals its full 
; mystery in today's image, and honestly earns its superior rating 
; of a 9.
; 
; The calculation time of 11 minutes is definitely slow, making 
; the web sites a far better way of viewing the scene.

; 
; Clouds moved in just after noon here at Fractal Central today.  
; Things were not as bad as they might have been however, as the 
; temperature reached 46F +8C.  The fractal cats grumbled when the 
; sun was obscured just as it reached their window shelf.  The 
; fractal humans simply did their usual grumbling.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a moderate number of hours.  
; Until we find out what moderate means, take care, and the 
; perfect SAT test would be one in which every student scores the 
; same mark.  But if we ever achieved this ideal goal, why would 
; we need the test?
