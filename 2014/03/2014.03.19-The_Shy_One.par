; FOTD -- March 19, 2014 (Rating A-7,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After seventeen years, not the sixteen years that I said a 
; couple days ago, the FOTD continues unabated, with no sign of a 
; slowdown in sight.  In fact, now that the graphic design 
; activity is intentionally easing off, I find myself with even 
; more time to work on the art aspect of the images.
; 
; Today's image lies in a parent Mandelbrot set that is corrupted 
; even on its surface by Z^(-0.5) energies.  The main sign of the 
; corruption is the fractally divided negative stem, where I found 
; today's curious scene lying just east of the partially split 
; main minibrot.
; 
; The name "The Shy One" points out how the outstanding bluish 
; feature is partially hidden behind the intruding dull red 
; foreground features, almost as though it were too shy to come 
; out into the open.
; 
; As I see it, both the art and math aspects of today's image rate 
; a 7.  The calculation time of just over one minute will pass in 
; a surprising semi-flash.  Fractalists who do not enjoy semi-
; flashes may find flash freedom on the FOTD web sites.
; 
; For total flash freedom, the finished image is posted at:

; 
; Heavy clouds and occasional light rain today here at Fractal 
; Central made the conditions totally unfit for outside activity.  
; The chilly temperature of 41F +5C made things only worse.  The 
; fractal cats realized early that there would be no sun, and 
; spent the day chasing each other up and down the hallway or 
; keeping warm near the living room radiator.  The humans spent 
; the day the same as they do every other day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the appropriate time.  Until 
; whenever that might be, take care, and the more gadgets we 
; become convinced we need to survive, the more frantic we are 
; becoming.  When I was young, we never got the nervous jitters 
; when we lost track of what our friends and relatives were doing 
; for an hour or two.  I guess it's the accepted modern life 
; style, but with all the new gadgets they keep telling us we 
; need, where will it lead?
