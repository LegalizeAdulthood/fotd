; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; If my records are correct, (which is not at all certain), today 
; is the 16th anniversary of the day I introduced myself and 
; posted the first fractal to the Fractal Art list.  To celebrate 
; the momentous occasion, I have reposted my original introduction 
; to the Fractal Art list.
; 
; START OLD STUFF--------------------------------------------------
; 
; Hi everyone:
; 
; I'm Jim Muth.  I'll introduce myself by telling a bit of my 
; background.  I am a short-story writer, graphic designer and 
; armchair philosopher, living in a large East Coast city 
; (Baltimore, MD) in the U.S.A.  I became interested in fractals 
; back in the 1980's, when the first article about the Mandelbrot 
; set appeared in the Scientific American Magazine.
; 
; I have always had a desire to explore unknown regions, but found 
; myself frustrated because the unknown parts of this world have 
; already been almost totally explored and the vast unknown places 
; of other worlds are yet to be reached.  The world of fractals in 
; a strange way fulfills that desire.
; 
; To me, fractals are mystical things, objects of a world neither 
; real nor unreal.  I am fascinated by them, by the tremendous 
; enigma of their existence, by the way they go on and on forever 
; -- infinity reduced to the size of a computer screen.  I am 
; fascinated by the simplicity of the mathematics behind them, as 
; well as by the incredible pictures they make.  But I am 
; fascinated most of all by their philosophical aspect.  As I work 
; with them, I constantly wonder what they are, and what do their 
; beautiful patterns mean.
; 
; What is a fractal?  The answer is simple -- the mapping of a 
; recursive function to the screen".  But stop a moment to 
; consider the Mandelbrot set, one of the simplest fractals.  How 
; many Mandelbrot sets exist, one or many?  If the Mandelbrot set 
; is merely the image that appears on a computer screen when the 
; formula Z^2+C is reiterated, then thousands of identical 
; Mandelbrot sets are constantly coming into existence and 
; vanishing as thousands of computers are switched on and off 
; worldwide.  If these images are separate entities, then why are 
; they identical?  Apparently, a unity lies behind the separate 
; images.
; 
; But if the Mandelbrot set is a single object that has an 
; existence beyond the ephemeral images that flicker on the 
; world's computer screens, then the question arises, "what type 
; of existence does this archetypal Mandelbrot set possess?"  Is 
; it real, imaginary or virtual?  The question sounds almost 
; comical until one thinks about it.  One might also ask, "did the 
; Mandelbrot set exist before computers were invented?"
; 
; Questions such as these are not so easily answered.  In some 
; ways the Mandelbrot set is no more than an idea, a potentiality 
; like sub-atomic particles, which according to certain 
; interpretations of quantum theory, do not come into existence 
; until they are actually observed.
; 
; Are fractals good art?  This is a question with as many answers 
; as there are people who answer it, for good art exists in the 
; mind of the beholder.  If a person glances at a fractal image 
; and passes on without second thought, then to that person 
; fractals are not art.  But if a person sees a degree of beauty 
; in a fractal image, if that image fills the person with a sense 
; of awe and wonder, then fractals are indeed art.
; 
; To me, fractals are art of the highest order.  I have created 
; many thousands of them over the past ten years, most of which 
; have long since been discarded.  But those discarded images 
; still exist somewhere out there, like ghosts lost in the ether, 
; waiting for the time when some unknown enthusiast enters the 
; same magic formula into a computer, and once again brings them 
; to life.
; 
; In future postings I'll have much more to say, some things not 
; quite so philosophical, others far more so.
; 
; END OLD STUFF----------------------------------------------------
; 
; When I wrote this I had no idea of the number fractals I would 
; post to various lists in the future.
; 
; As for today's image, it is a scene on the negative X-axis of a 
; Mandelbrot set corrupted by Z^(10.9) energies.  The scene is 
; located at a point where the main spike has divided into two 
; main branches, with today's image lying between the branches.
; 
; I have adjusted the escape radius (the real(p2) parameter) to 
; place the scene at the edge of annihilation, where the swiss 
; cheese effect is at a minimum.
; 
; The name "Random Arabesque" is the first phrase that came to 
; mind as I studied the image in search of a name.
; 
; In my opinion, which is what counts, the art is worth an 8 and 
; the math worth a 7.  The calculation time of just over 2 minutes 
; will pass quiclky enough, though the web sites can cut the wait 
; still further.
; 
; The calculation may be eliminated by checking the finished image 
; on the FOTD web sites at:

; 
; Today began with clouds threatening snow, but the snow remained 
; well to the south and the clouds broke in the afternoon, leading 
; to a pleasant but chilly day with a temperature of 36F +2C.  
; Fractal cat No.2 went to the vet's office this morning, where 
; the doctor told her that she had followed his instructions to 
; the letter and could once again run free.  Fractal cat No.1 
; greeted her with enthusiasm when she returned, but warned her to 
; slow down when she got too frisky with him, working off some of 
; her stored-up energy.  The humans were glad that the fractal cat 
; situation is back to normal.
; 
; The next FOTD will probably be posted in 24 hours.  Most FOTD's 
; are.  Until then, take care, and why is the U.S. so bothered 
; that the Crimeans have voted to be free.  I thought we're always 
; fighting with the 'enemies of freedom' to defend the right to a 
; free democratic vote.
