; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- March 12, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image we check the negative X-axis of the Z^(2.993)+C 
; Mandeloid as rendered by the MandelbrotBC3 formula at ground 
; level with no function applied.  Instead of being spread into a 
; wedge, the valley at this point is partly cut off, but as 
; today's image shows, the parts that remain are filled with 
; interesting nooks and crannies.
; 
; The name "Sugared Nonagon" came about when I got a sudden urge 
; for a chocolate bar while studying the image.
; 
; Thanks to the coloring, the art aspect of the image rates an 8, 
; while the overused math trick rates only a 5.
; 
; The calculation time of 4 minutes is slow, I admit it, but here 
; is where the web sites can save much precious time.

; 
; will be up and running in another day or two.
; 
; Clouds and occasional rain spoiled the day here at Fractal 
; Central.  The afternoon temperature of 50F 10C was mild enough, 
; but it began falling sharply in the evening.  The fractal cats 
; took it easy, Nicholas on the couch, Jasmine in her recovery 
; room.  The humans simply had another in a long series of 
; lackluster days.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a day or so.  Until then, take 
; care, and one thing which the remake of the 'Cosmos' series has 
; demonstrated so far is that TV producers have forgotten the 
; importance of good music in creating an awe-inspiring effect.
; 
; In 1983, when the original 1980 "Cosmos' series was being aired 
; for the second time, I was doing a series of two-hour radio 
; shows on a local college station.  On three shows I decided to 
; play the complete versions of the background music that made the 
; original 'Cosmos' series so impressive.  These shows were the 
; most popular of my entire series.
; 
; The first episode of the current 'Cosmos' series left me with 
; the impression that the program has an agenda -- to propagate 
; the secular humanist world view that sees the mystical 
; experience as a function of the living human brain rather than 
; as a real spiritual other-world experience.  Why else would the 
; cartoon character depicting 16th Century mystic philosopher 
; Giordano Bruno, be depicted as having a mystical vision of the 
; universe while his brain was still functioning, rather than 
; having the vision after his execution, which would have been far 
; more effective at creating the 'all was not lost' state of mind 
; that I assume the producer was (or maybe was not) seeking.
