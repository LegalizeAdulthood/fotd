; 
; FOTD -- March 23, 2014 (Rating A-8,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in a parent Mandelbrot set that is distorted 
; almost beyond recognition by Z^(1.5) energies.  The infecting 
; energy has split the M-set into a heart-shaped main bay with 
; large period-2 buds decorating the north and south sides of the 
; bay.  The entire perimeter of the main bay west of the two large 
; buds is chaotic, lined with smaller buds of no recognizable 
; periodicity.  Today's scene lies in the total chaos near one of 
; these chaotic-period buds.
; 
; The name "The Stars of Dawn" reminds me of a scene in Dante's 
; Divine Comedy, where the saved soul ascends beyond the planets 
; and stars on its way to heaven.  The deep blue background of the 
; image could easily represent the celestial heights.
; 
; Due to the intense colors, the art aspect of the image rates an 
; excellent 8.  The math aspect comes in at a 7, since the math 
; trick is not all that new.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/4 minutes makes the image a bargain. 
; The web sites can make the bargain simpler to view.

; 
; A layer of clouds hung over Fractal Central most all day today, 
; with brisk winds and a temperature of 37F +3C making it feel 
; like winter had returned.  The fractal cats spent the day 
; waiting for the sun to shine, but were disappointed.  The 
; fractal humans spent a couple hours watching the news on TV and 
; wondering how much of it is fiction perhaps occasionally based 
; on real events.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted, and that is no fiction.  The exact 
; time is still in doubt, but it will be in a day or two.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and they tell me that God sends good guys 
; to heaven and bad guys to hell.  But on what aspect of their 
; lives does He make the final decision?
