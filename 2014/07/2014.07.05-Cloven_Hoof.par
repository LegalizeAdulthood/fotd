; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- July 04, 2014 (Rating A-5,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the Mandeloid that results when the 
; expression Z^(2.1)+C is calculated only 1 level up the 
; hyperladder with no function applied.  This parent fractal 
; vaguely resembles a Mandelbrot set rotated 180 degrees with an 
; unusually broad Seahorse Valley neck.  Today's scene lies in the 
; Seahorse Valley of a larger minibrot on a filament extending 
; from the period-4 bud on the south shore line of the main bay of 
; the parent fractal.
; 
; The large open area at the center is actually an order-2.1 
; minibrot, but judging from its cloven-hoof shape, one would 
; never guess it.  The shape of this minibrot of course, is the 
; reason for the name "Cloven Hoof".
; 
; The appearance of such an unlikely shape in such an unexpected 
; location hints at the presence of the forces of evil.  The 
; cloven hoof has long been symbolically associated with evil and 
; especially with the prince of evil himself -- the devil!
; 
; I myself have no belief in an anthropomorphic devil, which to me 
; is a symbolic representation of the inherent weaknesses of 
; humanity, though there are certainly enough people in this 
; bible-belt area of Pennsylvania who still do believe in such a 
; being, and actually try to convince others that he does exist 
; and is waiting to receive their condemned souls if they do not 
; change their ways.
; 
; So, at the risk of eternal damnation, I present today's image in 
; a frivolous manner.  The cloven hoof is certainly only a curious 
; accidental shape, or could it be that . . .
; 
; The art rates a 5.  I don't want to give the devil more credit 
; than he already has.  The math rates a 7.  Could it be possible 
; that demonic forces have already worked their way into the realm 
; of numbers?
; 
; With a calculation time of 20 minutes, the image is surprisingly 
; slow.  Some of this could be due to the maxiter of 4200 . . . or 
; could it be a sign that the forces of evil are already infecting 
; the image?
; 
; The finished image is posted online at:

; 
; Rather unusual Independence Day weather prevailed today here at 
; Fractal Central.  The usual conditions are haze, heat and 
; humidity with a threat of rain on the fireworks displays.  But 
; today brought photoshop blue skies, puffy white clouds, low 
; humidity and a temperature of only 73F 23C.  The fractal cats 
; would have enjoyed the day if the occasional firecracker 
; explosions had not kept them on the alert.  The humans enjoyed 
; the day anyway.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a day or two.  Until whenever, 
; take care, and why is it so hard to separate the good from the 
; evil in the real world conflicts?
