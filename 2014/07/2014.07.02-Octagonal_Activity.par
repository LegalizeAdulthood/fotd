; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- July 01, 2014 (Rating A-6,M-7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal FOTD image lies in an oversized Mandelbrot set 
; corrupted even near its surface by Z^8 energies.  (The real p(1) 
; parameter defines the order of the corruption; the imaginary 
; p(1) parameter defines the intensity of corruption as well as 
; the size of the parent fractal.  The greater the value of the 
; imaginary parameter, the deeper the corruption is buried and the 
; less its intensity.)
; 
; Today's scene lies in the large minibrot on the main spike of 
; the parent M-set.  This minibrot has already partially morphed 
; into an order-8 minibrot, with an interesting mixture of Z^2 and 
; Z^8 elements.  Today's scene lies in some Z^8 stuff that is just 
; appearing in the area of Seahorse Valley of the main spike 
; minibrot.
; 
; The art rates a 6.  I did give the colors a bit of extra effort, 
; but hardly enough to make the image in any way exceptional.  
; With a rating of a 7, the math rates a little better.  I still 
; find higher order minibrots with such unexpected surrounding 
; patterns rather fascinating.
; 
; The image is astoundingly fast, calculating in a fireball 20 
; seconds or less.  And the web sites are always ready to remove 
; the task of calculation entirely.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:

; 
; Lots of heat and humidity prevailed here at Fractal Central 
; today.  A mild thunder shower in the afternoon cooled things 
; down from 95F 35C to 79F 26C, but also raised the humidity.  The 
; fractal cats went into full stretch-out mode in the coolest 
; places they could find, while the humans took the day as easy as 
; we have taken hundreds of others.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in a day or two or three.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and science is saying things about the 
; 'real' world that have even the most devout skeptics shaking 
; their heads in puzzlement.  As for me, I find their frantic and 
; often contrived damage control efforts quite amusing.
