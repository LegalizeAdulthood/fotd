; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "Inside-Out Midget".  I decided on the 
; name because the inside of the almost-midget is composed of 
; outside material.
; 
; The midget itself is located in the East Valley area of a larger 
; midget, which lies on a north filament of the main bud of the 
; M-set.  The midget's pattern starts out well enough around the 
; edges, but is overwhelmed by intruding foreign matter before the 
; midget itself appears.
; 
; The spot where the midget should be found is apparent, but no 
; midget is there.  What has happened is that the scene does not 
; lie in the classic M-set, but rather in the Hypercomplex M-set, 
; which is a four-dimensional slice of an eight-dimensional 
; Julibrot.  Though it cannot be visualized, this hyper-M-set can 
; be sliced in many places and in many directions.  (Not all 
; slices and directions can be drawn by the Fractint hypercomplex 
; Mandelbrot formula as it is presently written.)
; 
; Some of these slices cut the hyper-set in places where it 
; pinches off, causing different parts to appear to overlap.  When 
; features with different iteration values overlap, the features 
; with the lesser value will always prevail.  In today's image, 
; the lesser-valued outer elements of the midget prevail until the 
; iterations exceed the value of the elements that are 
; overlapping, at which point the intruding elements take over.  
; (The intruding elements are from a point close to the shoreline 
; at the northeast side of the main bay of the M-set.)  As a 
; result, we have a midget on a filament of the main bud of the 
; M-set with a different part of the M-set showing through its 
; open center.
; 
; With time enough, I could have found parameters that would have 
; had a smaller midget appear inside the larger midget.  
; Unfortunately, press time is here, and that surprise will have 
; to wait until another day.
; 
; But the image as it stands is worth a 7 IMHO, and its render 
; time of 19 minutes can be escaped by downloading the completed 
; GIF image from the W.W.Web at either:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or:

;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather was mostly cloudy and chilly Sunday here at 
; Fractal Central.  The mood of the fractal cats was just as 
; chilly when they came to me, complaining about the temperature 
; of 43F 6C and their inability to be comfortable outdoors.  I 
; told them that I was not responsible for outdoor conditions, but 
; they did not forgive me until I treated them to an unexpected 
; dish of tuna.
; 
; The hour has now come for me to get busy on other things.  So 
; until next time, take care, and see you in 24 hours.
