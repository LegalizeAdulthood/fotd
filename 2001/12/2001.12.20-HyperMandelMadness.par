; FOTD -- December 20, 2001 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; On Tuesday, Jon K. posted a letter to the Fractint list, 
; commenting on the FOTD of December 17, which is a scene in the 
; hypercomplex Mandelbrot set.  In the letter he asked whether an 
; easy way exists to find the locations of the top layer and 
; bottom layer in the hypercomplex set.  This question is more 
; complex than it seems.
; 
; To start, the appearance of different layers in the FOTD of 
; December 17 is an illusion.  The hypercomplex M-set is 
; 4-dimensional indeed, but only a single 2-dimensional slice of 
; it can ever be displayed by the hypercomplex formula.  (The 
; julibrot formula can display 3-dimensional slices.)
; 
; What is happening in the 12-17 image is that the hypercomplex 
; figure has been sliced in an area where different parts of it 
; are merging, actually trying to occupy the same points of 
; hyperspace, with the higher-iteration features being obliterated 
; by the lower-iteration features.  In the 12-17 image, we are not 
; looking through an eroded Mandelbrot shaped hole at features 
; that lie on the other side, we are seeing all that remains of 
; the higher-iteration features, the rest having been obliterated 
; by the surrounding low-iteration stuff.
; 
; Jon asked whether I know of an easy way to find scenes such as 
; 12-17's.  The answer is no.  Both 'layers' move in an 
; unpredictable manner as the parameters are changed.  The only 
; way I know to find such scenes is to track them down by trial 
; and error bracketing and to fine-tune the image with the 
; Fractint evolver.
; 
; As I noted in the 12-17 discussion, the hypercomplex formula of 
; Fractint does not draw all possible slices of the hypercomplex 
; Mandelbrot set.  The formula I wrote for today's image draws 
; more, though not all slices.  Today's formula has a drawback 
; however in that the periodicity must be shut off in order for it 
; to work correctly.
; 
; The p3 parameter of today's HyperMandelbrot formula works the 
; same as the cj and ck parameters of the hypercomplex formula.  
; (I have no idea what the unused parameters of the hypercomplex 
; formula are eventually supposed to be used for.)  The p1 
; parameter of today's HyperMandelbrot formula works roughly the 
; same as varying the initial Z parameters of the Mandelbrot set.  
; The p2 parameter does strange things indeed, things that are 
; almost unbelievable.  Since it alters the effect of the other 
; parameters, it is changed only at the risk of the user.  
; Enjoying risk, I set it to 0.5 for today's image, and when I set 
; p3 to 0.008, just look at what it did to our Mandelbrot set.
; 
; I named today's image "HyperMandel Madness" as a poetic 
; description, and rated it at an average 5.  With a running time 
; of 12 seconds, today's parameter file is virtually instantaneous.
; 
; As always, the completed GIF image is also available at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; With a little more sun and a little less wind, the fractal 
; weather Wednesday was somewhat improved over the day before, but 
; the dynamic duo still would have preferred a temperature of 77F 
; 25C rather than the 54F 12C that actually happened.  They were 
; in a surly mood until the sound of some stray cats fighting 
; somewhere in the brush sent them dashing to their lookout shelf 
; by the window, where they spent more than an hour.  Then, when 
; their evening mealtime arrived, they completely forgot their 
; troubles.
; 
; It's now time to accomplish something a bit more practical.  
; Until next time, take care, and don't get hyper.
