; FOTD -- December 31, 2001 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There's a load of work to be done before the year ends, and I 
; let Saturday and Sunday pass by without doing anything about the 
; work.  It's fun to procrastinate, but sooner or later one must 
; pay the price.  As a result of my laziness over the week-end, I 
; now must work like a demon (do demons work?) for the rest of the 
; day.
; 
; But no matter what, I'll always find time to uncover a fractal.  
; Today's image pictures a midget that lies deep in a very loose 
; spiral on the eastern extremity of the clover-leaf shaped 
; fractal created by the formula 6Z^(-2)+10Z^(-10)+(1/C).
; 
; I named the image "Hexidecimal Midget", a name so obvious for a 
; midget with sixteen arms that I might have used the name more 
; than once on a previous FOTD.  I have rated the image at an 
; average 5.  I can't rate a fractal that was found with almost no 
; effort any higher.
; 
; The parameter file renders in less than 8 minutes, even on my 
; old machine with the exhaust fan that runs without a kick-start 
; almost 75 percent of the time.  The image can be downloaded from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; in even less time.
; 
; The weather Sunday here at Fractal Central made the cats very 
; unhappy.  The high of 26F -3C was so cold that even the shelves 
; by the cats' lookout windows were drafty and uncomfortable, 
; leaving the cats nothing to do but settle themselves by the 
; radiators of their choice.  They didn't even ask to go out.  
; Testy cats make for an unpleasant day, but the ducks ice-skating 
; on a nearby pond were a lot of fun.
; 
; I have philosophical things to discuss, but I'm wondering if the 
; minimal interest of those few, if any, who bothered to 
; re-subscribe to the philofractal list would make it worth the 
; effort.  We'll ponder this situation in the days to come.
; 
; It's now well past 10am, and I must face the fact that I have a 
; good bit of work to clear up on this last day of the first year 
; of the 21st century.  Until the first day of the second year of 
; the 21st century, take care, and take it easy.
