; FOTD -- December 18, 2001 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's 10am Tuesday and all is well here in Fractal Land.  The sun 
; is shining, the dynamic duo is sleeping, and the neighborhood is 
; at peace.  It's a good day.  Not a single thing has gone wrong.  
; Of course, we have not yet had time for much to go wrong, so we 
; must not be prematurely optimistic that it will still be a good 
; day when nightfall arrives.
; 
; The fractal of the day, which I found Monday evening, is a 
; modest success.  I named it "Old Lace", intentionally leaving 
; out the arsenic.  I chose this name when I noticed the dusty 
; colors and appearance of loosely draped lace cloth.
; 
; The parent fractal is an indescribable, multi-lobed thing 
; standing on its nose, with an arc of bizarre midgets along the 
; outer perimeter of an area of chaos on its east side.  Today's 
; scene is located in a valley of the most prominent of these 
; midgets.
; 
; The rating of 6 might be a bit conservative, but a 6 I have 
; decided on, and a 6 it shall remain from today until the last 
; red dwarf star stops shining.  Then, if I'm still around, I 
; might raise the rating to a 7.
; 
; The render time of almost 17 minutes is rather slow, making the 
; image download the wise choice.  The download can be found at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Monday remained cloudy and chilly, with a 
; maximum temperature of 52F 11C, which is actually a few degrees 
; above the normal for this time of year.  The fractal cats, who 
; neither know nor care about normals and prefer their 
; temperatures summer-like, were unhappy.  They would prefer that 
; I install a heat-lamp on the porch, but they'll have to settle 
; for tuna or turkey.
; 
; For now, it's time to tackle the tail end of the pre-holiday 
; rush, and get it out of the way.  Until next FOTD, take care, 
; and if only we knew all the things we don't know . . .
