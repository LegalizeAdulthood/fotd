; FOTD -- December 28, 2001 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal image has more colors than one can shake an 
; iteration at.  In fact, it is so colorful that, at this festive 
; time of year, I had no choice but to name it "Festive_Holiday".  
; The colors actually are a bit overpowering, and for this reason 
; I could rate the image no higher than a 6.
; 
; The image was created by that overworked but not overvalued 
; formula, MandelbrotMix4, which today combines two negative 
; powers of Z and turns the resulting inside-out image right-side-
; out by adding 1/C instead of C.
; 
; To achieve the brilliantly colored effect, I colored the outside 
; with the <tdis> option.  Curiously enough, the width of the 
; brilliant yellow band immediately surrounding the midget can be 
; controlled by adjusting the maxiter of the image.  The greater 
; the maxiter, the narrower the band.
; 
; The render time of the parameter file falls 1/100 second short 
; of 5 minutes on my struggling, out-of-shape P200 machine.  On a 
; well-tuned machine with washboard abs and bulging biceps, it 
; should finish in less than 2 minutes.  The alternate choice is 
; to download the completed GIF image from the W.W.Web at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Thursday here at HQ was once again just 
; about what would be expected at this time of year -- brisk 
; breezes and a temperature that barely reached freezing.  This 
; meant that the fractal cats could not venture outdoors in 
; comfort.  When the fractal cats want to go outdoors and cannot 
; do so in comfort, they become quite irritable.  No surprise then 
; that the normally friendly brothers got into a heated argument 
; that ended with them rolling on the floor, fighting.  When they 
; settled their dispute, I treated them to left-over turkey, and 
; peace prevailed for the rest of the day.  The only damage is a 
; nick on Thomas's ear and a couple scratches on Tippy's head.
; 
; It's now time to shut down fractal HQ and call it a night.  The 
; cats are still at peace, and a small snack will keep them that 
; way for the rest of the night.  Until next FOTD, which will 
; happen in about 24 hours from now, take care, and be prepared 
; for philosophical pondering.
