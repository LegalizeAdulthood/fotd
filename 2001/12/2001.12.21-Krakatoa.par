; FOTD -- December 21, 2001 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I hate days like today, when I have no chance to find a proper 
; FOTD image or write a proper discussion.  But there is simply 
; too much to be done and, since I'm trapped in linear time that 
; moves with a will of its own, I have too little time in which to 
; do it.
; 
; Today's image rates a liberal 5.  It reminds me of an erupting 
; volcano.  I named it after that huge eruption toward the end of 
; the 19th century, which obliterated the island of Krakatoa and 
; was heard 3,000 miles away.
; 
; The formula behind the image is a very simple Z^1.19+C.  The 
; midget in the scene is located on a long meandering filament of 
; a larger midget.  The larger midget lies on a long meandering 
; filament of the parent fractal, which lies 5.4 turns (whatever 
; that means) up the logarithmic spiral.
; 
; The parameter file runs in less than 9 minutes, so not too much 
; patience is required to view the image this way.  An even more 
; efficient way of viewing the image is to download it from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Thursday was milder than what is expected at 
; this time of year, but still very uncomfortable for the fractal 
; cats.  The wind was too strong, the sky was too cloudy, and the 
; 43F 6C temperature was too cold.  The cats, being particular 
; about what they find acceptable, spent the day indoors, 
; alternating between their radiators and their lookout shelf by 
; the window.
; 
; Well, the holidays are getting close, and much remains to be 
; done.  I'd best get busy doing those things that need to be 
; done.  But I'll return tomorrow with another FOTD.  And the 
; philosophy has been lagging lately.  To rectify the situation, I 
; might have a bit of wisdom to share in a few days time.  Until 
; tomorrow, take care, and stay warm, (unless you're living in the 
; Southern Hemisphere or the northeast U.S., where you're not cold 
; in the first place.)
