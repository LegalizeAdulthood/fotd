; FOTD -- September 16, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a little object I turned up while wandering 
; aimlessly in the depths of Seahorse Valley of the large minibrot 
; on the main spike of the Mandelbrot set.  
; 
; I'm not sure it's proper to refer to fractal patterns as 
; objects, since they have no physical reality and certainly no 
; mass, but then, photons have no mass either and we see them 
; everywhere.  (I'll leave it to the erudite physicists to debate 
; whether photons, and all the other sub-atomic 'particles' for 
; that matter, should be considered objects.)
; 
; I named the image "A New Seahorse" because I've never before 
; seen a similar 'object' in a Seahorse Valley".  The rating of a 
; 7 is FOTD average, though with a calculation time of over 96 
; minutes, the image is over-priced.  The calculation time is slow 
; because the image is located quite deep in its parent Seahorse 
; Valley, where the iteration count is very large.
; 
; Perhaps the most striking feature of the image is its reddish 
; background.  I usually prefer deep blue backgrounds, but for 
; some reason the red background of today's image worked well 
; enough, at least for this one fractal.  Instead of reminding us 
; of a heaven up there, the image hints at a hell down below.
; 
; To avoid the cumbersome calculation, view the finished image on 
; the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; or view the high-definition version at:

; 
; Today brought a taste of autumn to Fractal Central at the end of 
; summer.  The weather was sunny, but the morning temperature of 
; 43F +6C kept the fractal cats totally in cold-weather mode.  The 
; humans, always alert for weather changes, realized that warm 
; weather does not prevail year-round in the temperate zones, and 
; had a few thoughts about preparing for the coming cold and snow. 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours regardless of the 
; weather.  Until next time, take care, and with all the cameras 
; around, when will we get a convincing photograph of a BESA (bug-
; eyed space alien)?
