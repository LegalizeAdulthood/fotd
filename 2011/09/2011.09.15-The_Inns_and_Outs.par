; FOTD -- September 15, 2011 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the debris-filled radical of a minor bud 
; on the northwest shore line of the large period-2 bud of the 
; Mandelbrot set.  The image lies at the extreme limit of the 
; range of conventional math, which makes it a very fast one.  In 
; fact, the magnitude is so great that breakdown is already 
; appearing, but due to the low contrast along the band edges, it 
; is not very noticeable.
; 
; The rating of a 6-1/2 includes a half-point for the coloring, 
; and even this rating might be a bit liberal, considering the 
; small amount of effort I put into the color palette.
; 
; The name "The Inns and Outs" is a play on words inspired by the 
; filaments in the image that flow into the large magenta areas 
; then flow out again.
; 
; The calculation time of 13 seconds is about as fast as images 
; get.  So if the result of the calculation is disappointing, 
; little time will have been wasted.
; 
; The official FOTD web site, with the completed image, may be 
; accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image, in high definition, is available at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original web site, as old as the FOTD itself, may be found 
; at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Heavy clouds and occasional rain made the conditions less than 
; ideal here at Fractal Central today.  The temperature of 55F 13C 
; kept the fractal cats in cool weather mode, while the humans, 
; always cool, had an uneventful day.
; 
; The next in the unending but not eternal series of FOTD's will 
; be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and how many 
; times does the phrase 'could it be' appear in those UFO shows.
; 
; (IMO, interstellar aliens visiting earth in their interstellar 
; space ships are even less likely than ghosts.  Ghosts have never 
; been proved to be impossible.  They merely show that there is 
; much to yet be discovered.  But the faster-than-light velocities 
; that would be necessary for aliens to travel the galaxy in 
; physical ships within a reasonable time, are known to be 
; impossible.  And warp drive, etc., etc., is a great fantasy.  
; Unfortunately, it's just a fantasy.)
