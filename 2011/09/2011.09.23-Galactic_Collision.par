; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image in the Z^2+C Julibrot is a rating puzzle.  I have 
; no idea how to rate it.  To begin, it's neither a Mandelbrot 
; image nor a Julia image.  It's an Oblate image, which means the 
; orientation of the slice is determined by the real(Z) axis and 
; imag(C) axis.
; 
; The scene is located in Seahorse Valley of the large minibrot on 
; the main spike of the Mandelbrot set.  But the actual location 
; is but a small part of the image.  I lost track of the amount of 
; rotation, stretching and skewing that went into it.
; 
; The image shows just two of the bottomless pits and endless 
; spirals that fill the area.  All the tiny nodes scattered 
; through the frame are more bottomless pits, and those pits are 
; filled with even tinier pits, to infinity.  That's how it goes 
; with fractals.
; 
; The name "Galactic Collision" came to mind at an early stage of 
; the coloring, when the image consisted of deep blues speckled 
; with tiny dots that resembled stars, and actually did somewhat 
; resemble colliding galaxies.  Since then I have totally 
; re-colored the image to the fiery reds that now prevail, though 
; I have the original name.  (Perhaps I should have stuck with the 
; original colors.)
; 
; The slow calculation time of 55 minutes is largely due to the 
; unusually high maxiter of the upper right quadrant of the scene, 
; where some elements have a maxiter of over 200,000.  (The 
; purplish band curving around the bottomless pit in the lower 
; left is actually the lowest-iteration part of the entire image.)
; 
; The official FOTD web site, where the finished image is posted, 
; may be accessed at:

;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>

; 
; Heavy clouds ruled the sky here at Fractal Central today, with a 
; steady rain in the afternoon adding to the unpleasantness.  The 
; temperature of 73F 23C was fair enough.  It's too bad the 
; weather was not fair also.  The fractal cats, who lead boring 
; but notably longer lives as indoor cats, took no notice at all 
; of the weather.  Food and play was at the top of their agenda.
; 
; Finishing the week's work was at the top of the human agenda, 
; and this task was accomplished with only minor problems.  The 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until that blissful 
; moment arrives, take care, and it's all the fault of those 
; aliens from the Herculean cluster, who are using earth as their 
; experimental laboratory.
; 
; No, I do not actually believe that aliens from outer space are 
; running the affairs of we humans here on earth.  But I would 
; have no trouble writing a book about an alien conspiracy and 
; using the things we have done and are doing to ourselves as 
; 'proof' that aliens are among us . . . hey, maybe I'll do it.
