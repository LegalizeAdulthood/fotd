; FOTD -- September 13, 2011 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image in the Mandelbrot set lies within the range of 
; conventional math, yet it rates an 8.5.  This shows that the 
; more accessible shallow parts of the M-set are not quite as 
; thoroughly explored as some might assume.  The image is located 
; in the debris-filled radical of a remote bud on the northwest 
; shore line of the main bay of the M-set.
; 
; The name "A Siegel Connection" refers to the resemblance of the 
; basins in the image to the so-called Siegel Disks of the siegel-
; disk fractals, the Julia sets with a C-value of 
; -0.390541,+-0.586788i.  Actually, I am not sure what is so 
; special about Siegel Disk fractals.  I assume the corresponding 
; Mandelbrot points of the official Siegel Disks are on the exact 
; edge of the M-set, yet an infinity of other points are also on 
; the edge.  Why then should these particular points be so special?
; 
; As is usually the case with fractional ratings, the extra half-
; point is a reward for my coloring, which is the greater part of 
; the image.
; 
; The extremely brief calculation time of 45 seconds can be 
; attributed to the relatively shallow magnitude of 3*(10^11), 
; which is within the range of the high-speed conventional math 
; routine.
; 
; For the convenience of those who do not calculate fractals, the 
; image is posted already calculated on the official FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; It is posted in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>

; 
; A near perfect day prevailed here at Fractal Central on Tuesday. 
; The blue skies, puffy clouds, gentle breezes and temperature of 
; 84F 29C were just what the fractal cats ordered.  They spent the 
; day in their window, wishing they could go out and be a part of 
; the world.
; 
; The humans passed the day just being human, which is sometimes 
; not as easy as it appears.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  For all I know, it might make it.  Until then, take 
; care, and are fractals animal, vegetable or mineral?
