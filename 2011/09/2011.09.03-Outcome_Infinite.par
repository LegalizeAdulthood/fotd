; FOTD -- September 03, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a minibrot in the center of the nuclear 
; blast that made yesterday's FOTD image a blast.
; 
; Apparently, conditions at the center of nuclear explosions are 
; so extreme that not even the laws of mathematics can survive 
; undamaged.  Check today's minibrot for a sample of mathematical 
; damage.
; 
; The minibrot in today's image is of order 2.000001, which means 
; it should be barely distinguishable from an everyday quadratic 
; minibrot, but today's minibrot looks nothing at all like a 
; normal minibrot.  It appears to be eroded and moth-eaten, most 
; likely from the intense heat of nuclear fission.  The same 
; scrambled confusion exists in the surroundings, which appear to 
; be trying to reach the usual 4,8,16... series, but are falling 
; apart before getting there.  It's a good thing the minibrot is 
; about at the limit of resolution.  Who knows what might lie 
; deeper in its basin of attraction.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is about average for FOTD images.  The name 
; "Outcome Infinite" means not quite as much as it implies.  The 
; calculation time of just under 7 minutes is slow by conventional 
; math standards.  Thank goodness for the web sites.
; 
; The image may be viewed already calculated on the official FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and in high definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The muggy conditions today here at Fractal Central made the 
; temperature of 86F 30C feel warmer than it otherwise would have. 
; The fractal cats had a thrill when Nicholas sensed a stray cat 
; passing by, and both he and Cassie dashed to the window to make 
; sure the cat continued on its way.  The humans did what humans 
; usually do on days that resemble thousands of other days. (No, I 
; am not bored with life.)
; 
; Unless armageddon arrives first, the next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if armageddon does arrive, 
; I'M A GEDDON the heck outta here.
