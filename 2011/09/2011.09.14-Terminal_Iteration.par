; FOTD -- September 14, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the parent fractal that is created when 
; 0.9 negative parts of Z^(3.8) are combined with 2.4 negative 
; parts of Z^(1.2) and (1/C) is added.  If this seems trite, be 
; informed that the entire expression is a mistake.  The exponents 
; were supposed to be equal but negative values.  I decided to go 
; with what I had however, instead of taking 10 seconds to 
; calculate the correct parent.
; 
; This wrong parent fractal consists of a small Mandelbrot set 
; with a disconnected crescent-shaped filament some distance east 
; of it.  A tiny M-set lies on this crescent, with today's scene 
; located in the East Valley of this tiny M-set.
; 
; I suspect that a scene almost identical to today's could be 
; found with a minimum of effort in the standard Mandelbrot set, 
; which adds nothing at all to the worth of today's image.
; 
; The rating of a 7 means that the image is good enough to qualify 
; for minimum FOTD honors, but that it will never win a prize.  
; The name "Terminal Iteration" can mean anything the most radical 
; fractalist would suppose.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/3 minutes is about average.  Since 
; the image is also about average, this seems just about the right 
; length of time.
; 
; The official FOTD web site with the completed image may be 
; accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version of the image is posted at:

; 
; A quite pleasant late summer day prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central today.  The temperature of 84F 29C and mostly sunny 
; skies brought out the laziness in both man and beast.  The 
; fractal cats, who are offended at being called beasts, spent the 
; day taking it easy in the windows with the least sun.  The 
; humans just took things as they came.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and with many thanks to the Purple Cow:
; 
;     I've never seen a Boltzmann brain,
;         I hope I never see one.
;     But I can tell you anyhow,
;         I'd rather see than be one.
