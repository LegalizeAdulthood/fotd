; FOTD -- September 02, 2011 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image immediately impressed me as a view of a nuclear 
; explosion seen from a distance of a couple miles.  Since a 
; nuclear war is the most likely way the world might end, I 
; promptly named the image "Armageddon Aspect".
; 
; The image is a view of the north edge of the infinitely-divided 
; main spike of the Z^(2.000001)+C Mandeloid as it appears in the 
; East Valley area of a minibrot located around -1.86 on the 
; spike.  Some curiously corrupt minibrots lie at the heart of the 
; nuclear explosion.  I may check one of these for the next FOTD.
; 
; Armageddon is the name given to the supposedly soon-to-come 
; ultimate battle between the forces of good, led by God, and the 
; forces of evil, led by the evil one himself.  We are assured the 
; forces of good will triumph, but the battle will leave the 
; planet in ruins and the survivors wishing they had believed some 
; of that stuff the fundamentalists tried to tell them.  (The full 
; details are in the last book of the bible, but you'll need a 
; program and score card to find your way through the symbolism.)
; 
; How could I rate an image that pictures the end of the world?  I 
; could not.  So I gave it a rating of a question mark, which 
; leaves the rating to be decided by the individual viewer.
; 
; The image calculates in a very brief 27 seconds, a much shorter 
; time than it will take the forces of good to defeat the forces 
; of evil in the big battle.
; 
; The annoyance of setting up the parameter file for calculation 
; may be avoided by viewing the finished image on the official 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version may be accessed at:

; 
; The original web site is at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The clouds hung overhead most all day here at Fractal central, 
; while the temperature of 77F 25C kept the fractal cats happy.  
; The humans kept moderately busy doing commercial stuff and 
; moderately happy pondering the possibility of retirement.  The 
; FOTD is in no danger of being retired however; in fact, the next 
; one will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be 
; satisfied with the world as it is, with all its problems.  It's 
; not going to change any time soon.
