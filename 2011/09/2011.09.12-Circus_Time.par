; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- September 12, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The most recent image, the one for September 10, shows a 
; minibrot very near the cut-off point of the truncated Mandelbrot 
; set that remains when the bailout is set to 2.  Today's image 
; shows a minibrot many orders of magnitude smaller and even 
; closer to the cut-off point.  In fact, the minibrot is well out 
; of sight.  Only the outer fringes of its surrounding pattern are 
; visible.  I chose a 'reset' point to add variety.
; 
; I could rate the image no higher than a 7-1/2.  These very deep 
; images are starting to develop a boring similarity, and a new 
; approach must be found to keep the ratings high.
; 
; I did put a bit of extra effort into the coloring, though the 
; image has such an over-abundance of fine detail that no coloring 
; would be totally satisfactory.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/5 hours is quite slow, especially 
; for an image that rates a mere 7-1/2.  Thank goodness for the 
; web sites.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high definition version is at:

; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The FOTD for September 11 is admittedly late, because this FOTD 
; is, or was, it.  But I cured the lateness by renaming the FOTD 
; for the 11th, the FOTD for the 12th.  The delay was caused by 
; the 120-pound, 55kg, front door of FC, which jammed shut due to 
; the dampness, and needed work.  At latest report, the door was 
; looser, but still quite sticky.
; 
; Morning clouds gave way to afternoon sun and a temperature of 
; 73F 23C here at Fractal Central on Sunday.  The scene was 
; repeated on Monday, much to the pleasure of the fractal cats.  
; The humans found enough things to do to keep them busy on both 
; Sunday and Monday.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  At least it is 
; scheduled to be posted.  Check back then to see if it actually 
; appears.  Until whenever, take care, and is it true that 
; fractals will dissolve in water but not in carbon-tetrachloride?
