; FOTD -- September 21, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Crack in the World", meaning the world 
; of fractals.  The name points out that the scene is located very 
; near the negative X-axis of its parent fractal, where everything 
; is broken apart.  This parent was created when I calculated the 
; expression Z^(2.01)+C at a level 11 turns up the logarithmic 
; hyper-spiral with the 'floor' function applied.  (Actually, I 
; think the 'floor' function gives the most accurate values of the 
; multi-valued complex logarithm, but it would take a better 
; mathematician than me to figure it all out.) 
; 
; The parent fractal is a distorted Mandelbrot set rotated about 
; 15 degrees clockwise, so that the southern branch of Seahorse 
; Valley intersects the negative X-axis.  Today's scene is located 
; near this point of intersection.
; 
; With its inward-jutting low-iteration elements, the image 
; appears as though it is very near the bailout cut-off point.  
; Actually, it is very near the X-axis, which serves as a cut-off 
; point in the image.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is perfectly average.
; 
; The calculation time of 5 minutes is a bit slower than I would 
; have preferred, but still brief enough to make the calculation 
; no more than a minor annoyance.
; 
; All the calculation problems may be avoided by viewing and 
; hopefully enjoying the finished image on the official FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; And check the high-definition version at:

; 
; Heavy clouds kept an all-day damper on things here at Fractal 
; Central today.  The temperature of 73F 23C was pleasant enough, 
; at least for the fractal cats, who approved of the lack of rain 
; as they enjoyed the outdoors from indoors.
; 
; My day was uneventful, which makes dull reading but a pleasant 
; experience.  FL had a more active day with black-spot infested 
; roses.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and be ever alert for charlatans.
