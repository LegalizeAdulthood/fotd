; FOTD -- September 10, 2011 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The X-parameter of today's main-spike image is very close to 
; sqrt(2).  This is no coincidence.  I intentionally set the 
; X-value to sqrt(2) when I chose the parameters.  The bailout 
; radius of the image is 2, which cuts off the set at a radius of 
; 1.414...  Today's image shows the closest minibrot to this 
; cut-off point that I could find.  Today's minibrot is not the 
; actual one closest to the cut-off however.  There are an 
; infinity of smaller ones closer than today's.  It is simply the 
; closest one that I took the trouble to find.
; 
; The rating of a 9 appears justified.  The coloring alone makes 
; the image worth the brief time required to run the parameter 
; file.  Almost all the colors were randomly chosen by the 
; Fractint program, though I did slightly tweak a few registers.
; 
; The name "Squarely Rooted" refers to the X-value of the image.  
; The calculation time of 8-1/2 minutes is surprisingly fast for 
; an image created with arbitrary precision math.
; 
; For the convenience of those who dislike the task of setting up 
; and running parameter files, the finished image is posted on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; It is posted in high definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The classic FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The weather has been changeable here at Fractal Central lately.  
; On Thursday it rained; on Friday the rain changed to showers; on 
; Friday night a very noisy thunder-storm passed over; on Saturday 
; we saw more showers.  But during all this time the temperature 
; hovered around 72F 22C, with little change.
; 
; The fractal cats disliked the activity when we prepared for 
; possible flooding, and they disliked the activity as we restored 
; FC to normal when the flood water stopped four blocks short of 
; FC.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and river, stay away from my fractals.
