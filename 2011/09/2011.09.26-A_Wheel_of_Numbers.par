; FOTD -- September 26, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's very deep Mandelbrot scene lies on a filament sprouting 
; from a minor period-5 bud on the northwest shore line of the 
; large period-2 bud of the set.
; 
; I named the image "A Wheel of Numbers" for very good reasons.  
; The elements certainly are in the shape of a wheel, and fractals 
; certainly are made of numbers
; 
; The rating of an average FOTD 7 might have been higher if I had 
; put more effort into the coloring.  But today is tax day, and 
; paying four-digit taxes always makes me irritable, which is a 
; poor mood for creating fine fractal art.
; 
; The calculation time of 48 minutes is slow, and there is no 
; excuse.  They sometimes say that anything worth having is worth 
; waiting for, but this is not always true.  Will the much-
; ballyhooed soon-to-arrive end of the world have been worth the 
; wait when and if it actually arrives?
; 
; Avoid this and all other calculation problems by viewing the 
; image already calculated on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; See the image in high definition at:

; 
; Too many clouds and a midday shower spoiled today at Fractal 
; Central.  The temperature of 81F 27C was well within the comfort 
; range, but the fractal cats were more concerned with a stray cat 
; that appeared on the back porch than with being comfortable.  
; When the stray cat wandered away, the fractal cats finally 
; settled down to relax as only a cat can.
; 
; The humans had an average day, though I became a bit annoyed 
; when I wrote the check for the taxes.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and the world that 
; appears to exist around us may be nothing more than a consistent 
; series of mental images.  But it sure is fun playing with the 
; images and pretending they're real.
