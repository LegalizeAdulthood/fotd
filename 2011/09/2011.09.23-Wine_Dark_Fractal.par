; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- September 22, 2011 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene that I originally passed by on the way 
; to the 'Primed for Growth' image of 3 days ago, September 19.  I 
; return to the area today because I originally saw in it some 
; FOTD potential.  The image is located in one of the two East 
; Valleys of a small Mandeloid just west of the main Mandeloid of 
; the parent fractal.
; 
; I named today's image "Wine-Dark Fractal".  The background 
; colors remind me of light passing through a bottle of red wine.  
; The name also creates an ancient Greek atmosphere, and as we 
; know, those classic Greeks were quite big on geometry.
; 
; The image itself has an overall dark, subdued appearance, with 
; curved strips of brilliantly colored confetti standing out like 
; fireworks in the night sky.
; 
; The rating of a 6-1/2 could be on the conservative side, but the 
; fact that this is the second expedition into the same fractal 
; area knocks a point off the rating.
; 
; The calculation time of just under 2 minutes will take the 
; frustration out of the calculation task.
; 
; Enjoy the image without the need to calculate it by visiting the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image is posted in high definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The classic FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Overnight rain ended by daybreak today here at Fractal Central, 
; leading to a cloudy, muggy day with a temperature of 79F 26C.  
; All of this must have agreed with the fractal cats, who have no 
; idea of their fractal nature and seemed unusually relaxed.
; 
; Being a human, (at least the last time I checked), I found the 
; day a bit too routine and slightly boring, but that's how it 
; seems to go in the second half of life.  FL found her excitement 
; worrying about the economic situation.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 100 years from 
; now we'll be asking, 'where were you when the end came'?
