; FOTD -- September 29, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Squarely Rooted".  This is because the 
; image was generated by the expression Z^(sqrt(2))+C calculated 
; 14 turns up the complex logarithmic hyperspiral with the 'recip' 
; function applied.
; 
; The parent fractal is a Mandeloid with a teardrop-shaped main 
; bay, rotated so that its main bud faces southeast.  It has only 
; one period-3 bud, but the usual higher order buds.  The scene of 
; today's image is in a field of debris located where the second 
; period-3 bud might normally be expected to lie.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 includes the standard 1/2-point bonus for 
; my color work.  The image itself is merely average.  To achieve 
; the flat-background effect, I rendered the scene with the logmap 
; set to an artificially high 67.
; 
; The shape of the minibrot at the center mirrors the shape of its 
; parent, which is a quite common thing in fractals with exponents 
; of Z between 1 and 2, where the parent fractals can assume most 
; any shape they wish, especially when calculated with alternate 
; values of the logarithm.
; 
; The calculation time of 32 seconds is blessedly brief, so why 
; not run the included parameter file and see what you might have 
; missed.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; for effortless viewing.
; 
; It is posted in high definition at:

; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The partly cloudy skies were fair enough, and the temperature of 
; 70F 21C was agreeable enough here at Fractal Central today.  But 
; the frequent showers made it a day to be forgotten.  The fractal 
; cats, ever forgetful, had already forgotten the day when it 
; began.
; 
; After almost 3 inches, 7cm, of rain overnight, the humans were 
; glad they had installed the sump pump.  A floor with a few 
; puddles is far better than a basement filled with 100cm of 
; water.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and if you would like to become wealthy in this sour 
; economy, open a shoe store for bigfooted sasquatches.  It must 
; be quite uncomfortable for them, stomping around in the cold mud 
; in their bare feet.
