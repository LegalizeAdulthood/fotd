; FOTD -- May 03, 2011 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I was recently surprised when Brian found a minibrot in a scene 
; that I had assumed and stated held no minibrots.  As is so often 
; the case in the world of fractals, things are not always as they 
; seem.
; 
; Knowing that minibrots were in the scene even though the 
; (apparently flawed) 'fmod' method had indicated they were not, 
; I made an old-fashioned search by locating areas of 2-way 
; symmetry and zooming into the center.  The old-fashioned way 
; soon led to today's minibrot and image.
; 
; I named the image "Most Unexpected", not because the minibrot 
; was unexpected, but because the round-cornered square is unlike 
; anything I have perviously stumbled upon in a fractal image.
; 
; The image was given extra excitement by rendering it with the 
; outside set to 'tdis'.  When I found an acceptable color 
; palette, the final result rated a lofty 9.  Part of the rating 
; expresses my pleasure at finding that there are more minibrots 
; in fractals than I had previously assumed.  Of course, since I 
; have always assumed the number of minibrots is infinite, it is 
; hard to explain how that number can be increased.  (Almost 
; anything done to infinity equals only more infinity.)
; 
; The calculation time of 1 minute is already quite fast, but even 
; this brief time may be saved by hopping to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted.  Those who prefer their 
; fractals in hi-def may find satisfaction at:

; 
; Hazy sunshine through a veil of clouds, a few sprinkles of rain 
; and a temperature of 70F 21C made Monday a very typical day for 
; the start of May here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats 
; spent the day trying to stay out of trouble.  They were almost 
; successful.
; 
; My day was annoying. It could have been better but also could 
; have been worse.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and pay no attention to what they tell 
; you on the telly.
