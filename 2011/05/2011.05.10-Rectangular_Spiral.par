; FOTD -- May 11, 2011 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In yesterday's discussion I remarked that some of the rectangles 
; in this area of the Julibrot are not empty, but filled instead 
; with some kind of stuff.  In today's image I give a sample of 
; what this 'stuff' looks like close up.
; 
; The name of the image is "Rectangular Spiral", and this indeed 
; is what I found inside one of the rectangles a short distance 
; off of the X-axis.  (The farther from the X-axis a rectangle is 
; located, the more distorted it becomes, and the more it fills 
; with debris.)
; 
; Today's image is filled from stem to stern with rectangles of 
; all sizes and shapes, the whole assemblage forming a kind of 
; infinite square spiral.  And the elements in the large spiral 
; are filled with smaller square spirals, all the way down.
; 
; The rating of an 8-1/2 indicates that I consider the image well 
; above average, and includes a half-point coloring bonus.  If I 
; had found a minibrot in the scene, I would have raised the 
; rating to 9-1/2.  (Minibrots probably are in there, but found 
; well beyond resolution.)
; 
; The calculation time of 2 minutes may be bypassed by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Those who prefer their fractals in high-definition will find 
; their wishes granted at:

; 
; Near perfect conditions prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Tuesday -- total sun, light winds and a temperature of 73F 23C.  
; The fractal cats slept through most of the good weather.  OTOH, 
; the humans worked through most of the day, taking time out in 
; the garden to enjoy the pleasant weather.
; 
; The next FOTD is due to be posted in 24 hours.  Most likely, it 
; will appear on schedule.  Until then, take care, and sometimes I 
; get a vague, gnawing feeling that the scientific description of 
; life misses something very important.
