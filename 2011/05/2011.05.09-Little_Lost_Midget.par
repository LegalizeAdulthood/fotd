; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- May 10, 2011 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's FOTD we remain in the rectangle-infested area of 
; the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid, where I found another minibrot 
; surrounded by rectangles.  This minibrot is a notable improve-
; ment over yesterday's however.  The fractal features are better, 
; the colors are better, and the rectangles are far more apparent. 
; Add all this together and the rating leaps to a 9.5.  If I had 
; put more work into the colors, the rating might have been a 10.
; 
; In yesterday's discussion I said today's image would feature one 
; of the rectangles that were barely visible in yesterday's image. 
; I calculated the image as promised, but before making it the 
; FOTD for today, I discovered today's actual image, which is much 
; better.  I also discovered that some of the rectangles in this 
; area of the Julibrot are not empty inside, but are filled with a 
; curious kind of chaos that promises to hold more unexpected 
; fractal wonders.  Perhaps one of these filled-in rectangles will 
; appear as tomorrow's image.
; 
; The name "Little Lost Midget" describes the minibrot at the 
; center of today's scene.  This name actually came to mind a bit 
; too easily, which leads me to wonder whether I have already 
; given a previous FOTD this same name.
; 
; The calculation time of just under 2 minutes is near FOTD 
; average.  And as always, this time may be saved by surfing to 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the completed image is posted.
; 
; The hi-def version is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and the original classic web site is available at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Monday turned into a repeat of Sunday here at Fractal Central, 
; with blue skies, puffy white clouds and a temperature of 70F 
; 21C.  The only flaw was a wind that was a little too fresh.  The 
; fractal cats held contention among themselves to a minimum, 
; which usually means they approve of the conditions.
; 
; The activity in the human department was routine, leaving little 
; to comment on.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and some saints claim to have seen heaven.  
; Does this prove that some saints are delusional or that heaven 
; does in fact exist?  Or does it merely show that we don't know?
