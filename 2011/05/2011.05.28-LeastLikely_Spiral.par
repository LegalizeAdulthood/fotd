; FOTD -- May 29, 2011 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is another super-quickie.  I got lazy.  Even the 
; most ardent fractalists sometimes feel lazy when the weather is 
; warm.
; 
; To produce today's image I started with yesterday's mallard duck 
; and gave him his proper plumage by rendering the fractal with 
; the inside set to 'zmag'.  (In my haste, I forgot to give the 
; poor bird his plumage in yesterday's image.)
; 
; Apparently, I also forgot to give him a bill. (A duck would have 
; a hard time dabbling for food without its bill.)  Today, feeling 
; sorry for the bill-less bird, I went to the spot where the bill 
; should have been attached, but nothing I tried came anywhere 
; close to adding a workable duckbill.  Finally, in frustration, I 
; checked a small area of debris in the vicinity.
; 
; After a brief search of the debris field, I found no bill, but 
; the broken spiral that appears as today's image was enough for 
; an FOTD.  There is not much I might say about the image, which 
; is best left to quack for itself.
; 
; I gave the image no rating, though a rating of something like a 
; 5-1/2 seems appropriate.  The name "Least Likely Spiral" 
; reflects the disconnected nature of the spiral, which I assume 
; is endless.
; 
; To see the image, set up and run the included parameter file.
; 
; The image is posted already calculated on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and in high definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site is at:

; 
; A very pleasant day prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Saturday, with lots of sun and a temperature of 82F 28C.  The 
; humidity was rather high, but fractal cats do not worry about 
; humidity, so the dynamic duo had a relaxed day, and even managed 
; to avoid getting into trouble.  The humans had a reasonably 
; pleasant day also.  I spent a good part of the time watching the 
; clouds drift by, while FL busied herself working in the garden.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  With the first 
; holiday of summer coming up, the next fractal or two might be 
; more quickies.  Until then, take care, and I finally worked out 
; the answer to the perplexing measurement problem, but as soon as 
; I finished, my answer became uncertain.
