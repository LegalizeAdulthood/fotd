; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When certain people have trouble sleeping, they sometimes count 
; sheep.  When I can't sleep however, I begin mentally exploring 
; an imaginary four-dimensional world.  My imaginary world is 
; truly four-dimensional; the problem is that I can mentally ex-
; plore it only one 3-D slice at a time.
; 
; As our planet earth has a curved two-dimensional surface, my 4-D 
; world has a curved three-dimensional hypersurface.  On earth, 
; two coordinates, latitude and longitude, are necessary to posi-
; tion a point; on my 4-D world, latitude, longitude and lithi-
; tude, (my own invention), are required.  Moving in the lithi-
; tude direction does not take us into the sky or underground; it 
; moves us in the third dimension, flat along the hypersurface.
; 
; To reach a given location on this 4-D world, we start at the 
; zero-zero-zero point on the equator, which is a great circle 
; that circles the planet just as earth's equator does, and from 
; there we travel until we reach the correct longitude.
; 
; Now we find ourselves with a problem.  Before we can set off 
; toward the pole, we need to determine in which direction to go.  
; On earth there are two directions, north and south, leading 
; toward the two polar points; on my 4-D world there is a full 360-
; degree circle of directions extending from the equator, each 
; direction leading to a distinct point on the polar circle.  The 
; direction in which we must travel away from the equator is the 
; lithitude.  Once we have chosen the lithitude, we need the lati-
; tude coordinate, which tells us how far to go toward the polar 
; circle in the direction we are traveling before we reach our 
; destination.
; 
; But even stranger things than this happen on my planet.  There 
; is also the matter of rotation.  On earth, rotation is a simple 
; thing -- the planet rotates on its axis, a line that extends 
; through the globe from pole to pole.  But on my 4-D planet, the 
; axis of rotation is a plane that cuts the hypersurface along the 
; polar circle, a curiosity that causes complications.
; 
; The problem arises because the polar plane exists in two dimen-
; sions that are stationary even as the planet rotates around it.  
; The polar plane is therefore free to rotate on itself, with the 
; equator as the axis of its rotation.  And in a universe with 4-D 
; gravity, it is unlikely in the extreme that the polar plane does 
; not have at least some degree of rotation.  The 4-D planet is 
; subject to two independent rotations at the same time.  Every 
; point on the hypersurface as well as every point within the 
; planet is tracing out what is known as a surface of double revol-
; ution, a kind of 4-D donut.
; 
; Things on the surface of my planet move in paths resembling 
; spirals, which curve back on themselves into closed loops.  This 
; means that the stars in the hypersky must move in helixes.  What 
; fun it must be to set up camp in some dark spot on the hypersur-
; face of my hyperplanet and point a hypertelescope at the hyper-
; stars and hyperplanets.  The hypertelescopic clock-drive would 
; be a complex device, but I'm sure that it could be made.
; 
; If the two rotations are equal, things get even more complica-
; ted, but this is a story for another day.  For now, we have a 
; fractal to investigate.
; 
; Today's image lies in the parent fractal that comes about when 
; Z^(1.25) is subtracted from Z^(-1.75) before (1/C) is added on 
; each iteration.  This parent is more a field of debris with two 
; large Mandeloids than a single object.  Today's scene is located 
; in some debris lying between the two largest Mandeloids.
; 
; There is not much to be said about the fractal, so I'll let it 
; speak for itself in visual terms.
; 
; The name "Bubbles in Numbers" refers to the bubbly shapes in 
; today's image and also to the fact that fractals are made of 
; numbers.
; 
; The rating of a 6 indicates that the image has room for 
; improvement.
;

; There were too many clouds at Fractal Central on Monday for the 
; day to be considered a good one.  The temperature of 75F 24C was 
; fair enough however.  The fractal cats spent the day plotting 
; mischief, but fell asleep before they could put their plot into 
; action.  In the afternoon a tornado warning came over the radio, 
; but the storm passed over with only a strong wind squall and a 
; torrential rain.
; 
; The day of the humans was one more in an unending series of 
; similar days.  But the older one grows, the more such uneventful 
; days are appreciated.  The next in the unending series of FOTD 
; fractals will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; when do we get to see the all of fourth spatial dimension in one 
; moment of time?
