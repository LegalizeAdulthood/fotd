; FOTD -- May 23, 2011 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today, with time at a premium, it's back to fractals-101.  When 
; I booted the first version of Fractint that had the ability to 
; calculate fractional powers of Z, the first formula I tried was 
; the type=manzpower, and the second thing I did was check the 
; Julia set of the point on the negative X-axis where the western 
; shore line of the main bay lies.
; 
; What I found was a fractal that rather resembles one of those 
; extinct marine animals known as trilobites.  But an animal that 
; once oozed through prehistoric sea-floor slime makes a poor 
; model for a fractal.  Luckily however, the trilobite was surroun-
; ded by a ring of graceful though stylized fractal trees.
; 
; One of these trees appeared as one of the very first FOTD 
; images, though that image was calculated at a much lower 
; maxiter than today's version.  The original version cut off the 
; deep spirals that engulf the sides of the crown of the tree.
; 
; I could not give a rating to today's image.  I put relatively 
; little coloring effort into it, and it must be about the eighth 
; fractal tree in FOTD history.
; 
; The name "The Original Tree" simply reminds the viewer that such 
; a tree was the first of the infinity of fractal trees that I 
; stumbled upon.
; 
; Actually, this fractal tree stuff is quite common in the 
; fractals created with fractional exponents, and can be turned 
; into several other rather convincing things such as fractal 
; landscapes on alien planets.
; 
; The finished image is posted, already calculated, at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The hi-def version of the finished image is at:

; 
; The classic original FOTD web site is at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Saturday turned into the most pleasant day in over a week here 
; at Fractal Central, with partly cloudy skies and a temperature 
; of 81F 27C.  A few showers were scattered around the area, but 
; they all missed FC.  Sunday was not so pleasant.  The sky was 
; totally cloudy and the temperature reached only 73F 23C.  The 
; fractal cats had two uneventful days, spent mostly sleeping.  
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and do well in your endeavor.
