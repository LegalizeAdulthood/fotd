; FOTD -- May 12, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a view of the curious Julia rectangle as it 
; appears in the Oblate plane, which is determined by the real(Z) 
; and imag(C) axes.  When viewed from this angle and given an 
; appropriate amount of stretching and skewing, the rectangle 
; pretty much retains its rectangular shape.
; 
; The name "It Has No Symmetry" accurately describes the image.  
; At first glance, the image does indeed appear to have origin 
; symmetry, but a close inspection will reveal small discrepancies.
; 
; The rating of an 8 could have been a half point or so higher if 
; I had not re-used a previous color palette.
; 
; The calculation time of 3 minutes is well within reason, but all 
; the fuss and bother that goes with setting up and calculating 
; a parameter file may be forgotten by viewing the finished image 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image may be seen in hi-def at:

; 
; I find the inability of the human mind to visualize the fourth 
; dimension most curious.  Computers have no problem converting 
; the math of the fourth dimension to spatial coordinates and 
; manipulating the resulting spatial figures exactly as they do 
; with everyday 3-D figures.  It would even be possible to 
; construct a monitor with a 3-D viewing surface, ready to be 
; enjoyed by a 4-D viewer.  Unfortunately, a normal 3-D man with 
; his 2-D retinas would be able to view such a screen only from 
; the 'edge-on' direction and would be unable to enjoy the 4-D 
; show any more than he could enjoy viewing a normal flat screen 
; edge on.
; 
; Why are we limited to visualizing three dimensions, when such 
; fascinating things as double rotation and undistorted Klein 
; bottles exist only one dimension higher.  It is impossible for 
; us to imagine even a 2-D flatland or a 1-D line without automati-
; cally mentally embedding these lesser spaces in a surrounding 
; 3-D space.  The limitation is not due to the math, which merely 
; grows more tedious as the number of dimensions increases, with 
; nothing of a totally new nature appearing.
; 
; There is a theory, not entirely scientific, that our inability 
; to visualize 4-D figures is a limitation of our level of con-
; sciousness, which is stuck at the 3-D level.  This would imply 
; that a being with a higher level of consciousness might be able 
; to visualize the fourth dimension, or might even interpret the 
; sensory impressions of the world he lives in as possessing four 
; spatial dimensions.  If so, he would not be around too long to 
; enjoy his advantage.  Stable planetary orbits are impossible in 
; a space of four dimensions with its inverse-cube law, and if our 
; math is correct, a planet in 4-D space would either spiral into 
; its star or spin off into interstellar space.
; 
; But then again, maybe a 4-D man would have different laws.
; 
; The days keep getting better here at Fractal Central.  Wednesday 
; featured cloudless skies, gentle breezes and a cat-pleasing 
; temperature of 77F 25C.  The fractal cats, totally pleased, 
; spent the day sleeping and dreaming of what they might do if 
; they ever get to go outside.
; 
; The humans had more mundane things to attend to.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  It will likely be another view of 
; the rectangle.  There is still much yet to be discovered in the 
; vicinity.  Until then, take care, and Nostradamus says the world 
; will end in 589 days.  It's got ME worried.  I thought we had 
; 5-1/2 billion years.
