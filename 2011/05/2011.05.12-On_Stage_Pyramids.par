; FOTD -- May 13, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows the curious rectangle in its Parabolic 
; aspect.  Well, it's not exactly the Parabolic view, since the 
; slice is rotated 30 degrees toward the Julia orientation.
; 
; It might be difficult to pick out the rectangle at first glance. 
; Actually, the rectangle is located at the top of the central 
; pyramid, where it butts against the ceiling.
; 
; A good part of the image, including the pyramids, consists of 
; 'inside' stuff made visible by the 'bof61' inside fill.  The 
; 'outside' stuff fills the top part of the frame.
; 
; I named the image "On-Stage Pyramids" when I had the impression 
; of a theater stage filled with living pyramids performing their 
; routine.  But performing pyramids can be a rather dull act to 
; watch, so I could rate the image no higher than a 7, which BTW 
; is FOTD average.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes may be avoided by viewing 
; the completed image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-fefinition version is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And the original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; If I had three wishes, and it was forbidden to wish for extra 
; wishes, the first wish would be to gain the ability to visualize 
; the fourth spatial dimension without resorting to the trick of 
; using time as the fourth dimension.  I know all the parts of 
; simple 4-D objects such as the hypercube and hypersphere, but 
; even after all these years I am unable to connect the parts into 
; a single hyper-object.
; 
; Then I wonder how a person would react if they suddenly found 
; themselves with a 4-D body living in a 4-D world.  If they could 
; survive the sensory overload, would they recognize the things 
; they previously could picture only one 3-D section at a time?  
; Would they recognize a hypercube or hypersphere, and what about 
; that strange 4-D object with no analog in 3-D space, the 
; 24-cell?  How would they cope with the experience of walking on 
; a planet where the horizon appears as a sphere surrounding them 
; in all directions, even the directions we in 3-D space call up 
; and down?
; 
; Oh well, I guess it's a nice dream.  Too bad I'll never be able 
; to fulfill it.  It's all very frustrating, so to whom do I 
; complain about this inability to visualize the higher spaces 
; that physicists are now claiming actually exist?
; 
; Spring was in full swing here at Fractal Central on Thursday, as 
; the temperature reached 79F 26C under bright sun.  The fractal 
; cats spent the day chasing the sun around the kitchen floor.
; 
; The humans had one more in a long series of typical days, which 
; seem to pass with nothing worth telling taking place.  It should 
; hardly be necessary to tell that the next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and seek the answer where you 
; least expect to find it.
