; FOTD -- June 01, 2011 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Rainy-Day Minibrot".  I gave it this 
; name because the image was resurrected from my 'reserve' files 
; -- older images that I hold in reserve to recall when laziness 
; attacks as it did on Tuesday.
; 
; The image shows a minibrot of order 2.05 located near the 
; negative X-axis of the parent fractal that results when the 
; formula Z^2.05+C is iterated at a level of a measly 0.12 turn up 
; the log spiral with the 'recip' function applied.  This parent 
; is shaped almost exactly like the minibrot.
; 
; Since the image is an older one and I put almost no new coloring 
; effort into it, I could give it no rating.  But if I had rated 
; it, I would have given it a rating around a 5.5.
; 
; The calculation time is a very zippy 36 seconds.  Calculation 
; may be avoided however by viewing the finished image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition is at:

; 
; The classic FOTD web site is at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Total heat and humidity prevailed here at Fractal central on 
; Tuesday.  When the temperature reached a high of 95F 35C the 
; fractal cats retired to the cool tile of the bathroom floor, 
; where they spent the next several hours.
; 
; Meanwhile the humans took things easy in their own way.  FL 
; checked to see that the garden was well watered, while I 
; relaxed with a fractal.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and the current issue of 'Time' 
; magazine has an article about the tendency of people to look at 
; the bright side of bad events instead of the realistic side.  I 
; have not yet had a chance to read the article, but it is proba-
; bly irrelevant.  I am certainly not guilty of looking at the 
; bright side of bad things.  (I'll have more to say about this in 
; an upcoming FOTD.)
