; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is titled "Minibrot for the Ages".  This is admit-
; tedly an exaggeration, but the minibrot actually is the most 
; impressive I have yet found in a Mandeloid with an exponent of Z 
; less than sqrt(2).  In today's image the exponent is a lowly 
; 1.08.
; 
; The parent fractal was calculated 16 levels up the complex-
; logarithmic hyperladder with the 'recip' function applied.  
; Using this function probably defeats the original purpose of the 
; formula, which was to create an animation of the different 
; fractals that can be created from the different values of the 
; multi-valued complex logarithm.
; 
; This parent is shaped much like the minibrot in the image, 
; though it lacks the prominent hook, and has a 'nose' on what 
; would be the upper right side of its main bay.
; 
; Today's minibrot is very large.  In fact it is actually visible 
; on the northeast shore line of its parent with only the slight-
; est magnification.
; 
; The rating of an 8 might have been higher if I had devoted more 
; effort to the coloring, which I admit is a bit haphazard.
; 
; The image calculates is an unremarkable 3 minutes.
;

; 
; Periods of sun interspersed with occasional thunder-showers made 
; Friday an interesting day here at Fractal Central.  The tempera-
; ture of 70F 14C was mild enough by winter standards, but rather 
; chilly for late May in central Pennsylvania.  The fractal cats 
; had a typical day, though I think a bit of bad feelings arose 
; between them in the afternoon.
; 
; FL and I sometimes think of screening the back porch, adding 
; shelves for the duo to leap onto, and making the entire porch 
; into a catarium, where they can climb around and watch the 
; world from their high, safe perches.  The fractal cats appear to 
; be ready for it.
; 
; The humans had a frustrating day.  We got word that one of our 
; biggest customers will no longer be using our design services.  
; This will leave more time for work on fractals, but less money 
; for other things.  Luckily, fractals are free and the supply of 
; them is infinite.  The next fractal will be posted in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and don't waste your energy worrying 
; about things that have no chance of happening.
