; FOTD -- May 26, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us back to the original fractal tree that 
; appeared as the FOTD for May 23, 2011.  Today, instead of 
; focusing on the entire tree, we venture deep into its fractal 
; wood to check its internal cellular structure.
; 
; What we find there is a field of strange flattened cells that 
; look like they have been squashed in a press.  But even more 
; startling is that the field of cells appears to stretch into the 
; distance toward a horizon, making a scene that could possibly 
; exist on an alien planet circling another star.  It's not so 
; unexpected.  After all, in the original discussion I did comment 
; that these fractal trees also make good alien landscapes.
; 
; To bring out the landscape effect, I gave the sky a shade of 
; deep blue, which might be found on a planet with a thinner 
; atmosphere than earth's.  Luckily, unlike on Mars, there is no 
; dust in this atmosphere to spoil the purity of the blue sky 
; overhead.
; 
; The name "Cells of a Fractal Tree" describes the coral-colored 
; objects in the image.  The rating of a 7 indicates that I 
; consider the image to be above average but not exceptional.
; 
; The finished image is available on the internet at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>

; and in high definition at:

; 
; Total sunshine prevailed here at Fractal Central on Wednesday.  
; The sun, along with the temperature of 82F 28C, made it one of 
; the finest days of the belated spring.  The fractal cats passed 
; the day lazily watching the world go by, but snapped to full 
; alertness when Cassie spotted a bedraggled long-haired white cat 
; prowling in the back yard garden.
; 
; The humans' day was acceptable.  Other than working, I spent 
; much of the day watching the tornado action on the Weather (and 
; advertisement) Channel.  FL spent some time working on her 
; 'CrossScan' puzzles and hoping they become a big hit.  I helped 
; her hope.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and if at first you don't succeed, try and try 
; again -- and then give up.
