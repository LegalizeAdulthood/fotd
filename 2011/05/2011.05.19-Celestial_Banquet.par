; FOTD -- May 20, 2011 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is not new.  It is an updated version of a FOTD 
; that I first posted over 10 years ago.  For the image's second 
; appearance, I did a slight outzoom and slightly intensified the 
; colors.  The result rates a 9.5, (at least IMO), with the extra 
; half point honoring the coloring effort.
; 
; The parent fractal is more a scattering of bits and pieces than 
; a single large bay surrounded by interesting details.  But there 
; is one prominent element, and today's image lies in a valley of 
; a bud in this large element.
; 
; The name "Celestial Banquet" was inspired by the heavenly effect 
; of the turquoise surroundings, where the angels are almost 
; visible dancing on the gossamer clouds.  I guess the saints are 
; watching from the sidelines.  The spiky arms shooting off in all 
; directions give just enough impression of gateways to infinity 
; to complete the transcendental experience.
; 
; Actually, such a heaven, at least IMO, would be more of a hell 
; than a reward.  What could be worse than being stuck in a boring 
; church service that would never end, lacking even the ability to 
; escape into sleep.
; 
; I have heard it said that when Casanova, having lived a life of 
; sin, finally arrived at the golden gates, he was met by Saint 
; Peter, who took no time in consigning him to the other place.  
; Hearing the expected bad news, Casanova turned and saw before 
; him two doors, one leading to a very solemn church service where 
; the saved souls were forever praising God, singing unending 
; hymns and listening to unending sermons; the other leading to a 
; place of unending fun feast and sinful frolic, where the con-
; demned souls were wallowing in their own debauchery, eating and 
; frolicking without the need to ever take a rest break.  "It's 
; not as bad as I feared," Casanova said as he turned toward the 
; door leading to the place of debauchery.  But before he could 
; reach the door, Saint Peter called out and warned him that he 
; had made a mistake and was going toward the wrong door.
; 
; The 3-1/2 minute wait while the image cooks may be avoided by 
; visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and viewing the image, already calculated, there.
; 
; The high-definition version is posted at:

; 
; The classic FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Heavy clouds and occasional rain prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central on Thursday, with occasional rumbles of thunder thrown 
; in for good measure.  The temperature of 63F 17C kept thoughts 
; of imminent summer far away.  The fractal cats seemed not to 
; notice the outdoor conditions.  They were more concerned with 
; being properly fed.
; 
; The humans had an average day with the usual frustrations.  The 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and why look to the sky for the light when the light may lie at 
; your feet?
