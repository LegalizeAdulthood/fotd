; FOTD -- May 25, 2011 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's FOTD I have another go at the 'Minibrot for the Ages' 
; that appeared as the FOTD for May 21.  Well, actually it's not 
; the same minibrot.  The May 21 minibrot has an exponent of 1.08, 
; while today's version has an exponent of 1.0745.
; 
; As the exponent is reduced, the prominent hook changes into an 
; arch, and the entire minibrot moves toward the main bay of the 
; parent fractal, where it is quickly swallowed up.  Today's image 
; catches it as it plows through the fine grit on the shore line 
; of its parent's main bay, shortly before it dives into the bay.
; 
; To get top detail, it was necessary to render today's image at a 
; maxiter of 32,000, which increases the calculation time to an 
; annoying 40 minutes.
; 
; The image was rendered with the outside set to 'fmod'.  This is 
; a mistake, since I wanted to try the scene in the normal 
; outside=iter manner.  But by the time I had realized the error, 
; 40 minutes had passed, and the image was finished, and it even 
; looked rather pleasing, so I let it go as FOTD for May 25.
; 
; The name "Demystified Midget" indicates that all those strange 
; holes around the base of the hook of the original version are 
; actually parts of the second half of the minibrot peeping 
; through.  Today's image removes all doubt that half of the 
; original minibrot is actually obscured from view.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is for artistic value.  The mathematical value 
; is closer to a 9.
; 
; To view the scene, either run the included parameter file or 
; view the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-def version will soon be posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A mix of sun and clouds, and a summer like temperature of 81F 
; 27C made Tuesday a near ideal day here at Fractal Central.  The 
; fractal cats must have agreed, for they spent an unusual amount 
; of time watching the outside world, which is a cat's TV.
; 
; The humans had an uneventful day.  This is always a good thing, 
; and if tomorrow is just as good, the next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and never say never.  If 
; things keep going as they are, one of these days we may find 
; that one plus one suddenly equals three.
