; FOTD -- May 30, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we enter "Uncharted Territory", which is what I named the 
; image.  Never before have I checked a fractal with an exponent 
; as close to unity as 1.009, making today's image uncharted for 
; sure.
; 
; The graph of Z^1.009 is virtually a straight line, so how is it 
; possible that a fractal as rich and varied as today's could come 
; about?  The answer is the multi-valued nature of the complex 
; logarithm.
; 
; The complex log is multi-valued.  This means that it has many, 
; in fact an infinity of values, and all of them are 'correct'.  
; When applied to fractals with fractional exponents, these 
; different values create different fractals, all of which are 
; correct.  But curiously, when applied to exponents very close to 
; unity, as is today's, these different values create some 
; unexpectedly rich images, in effect turning a 'sow's ear' into a 
; 'silk purse'.
; 
; Today's image lies in one of these 'silk-purse' fractals.  The 
; parent fractal is an apparently featureless ellipse, but a close 
; examination reveals a tiny bit of chaos on the southeast shore 
; line.  Today's image lies in this chaos.
; 
; I used the built-in black-and-white color palette to create the 
; 3-D effect.  Other palettes might have worked better, but an 
; attack of terminal laziness prevented me from trying to find 
; one.  This laziness held the rating to an everyday 7.

; 
; Typical midsummer weather made Sunday a typical midsummer day 
; here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats spent the day doing 
; what cats do when the temperature reaches 88F 31C -- they 
; stretched out and went to sleep.
; 
; The humans took it just as easy, though we did stay awake at 
; least most of the time.  The next FOTD is due to be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and don't ask me what I think 
; is wrong with the new world being brought about by the recent 
; advances in technology.  I just might start to answer.
