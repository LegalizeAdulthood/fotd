; FOTD -- October 15, 2011 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Rarely does a parent fractal become Fractal of the Day, but 
; today is the second consecutive day on which a parent fractal 
; has been featured.
; 
; In yesterday's image we saw that the (-Z)^(1.05)+C Julibrot 
; apparently holds no interesting semi-chaos, at least not in the 
; area of Seahorse Valley.  In today's image we find that first 
; impressions are sometimes wrong.
; 
; Today, we check the hump that passes for East Valley in the 
; Mandelbrot aspect of the Julibrot.  We check it at an angle 
; double rotated 37.5 degrees toward the Julia direction, and what 
; we find is total chaos.  While all the edges in yesterday's 
; image were smooth, today's image shows nothing but chaos in its 
; eastern parts.  To add to the interest, this chaos consists of 
; discontinuities, which vary widely in character in different 
; parts of the image, yet have a similar theme in restricted areas.
; 
; Such a mixed-up Julibrot surely has many additional curious 
; slices in this East Valley area.  I'll be checking other slices 
; over the next few days, and I would not be surprised if some 
; slices achieved FOTD image status.
; 
; The name "The Big Surprise" expresses my feelings when I checked 
; the 37.5,37.5 angle of today's slice through 'east hump'.  The 
; rating of a question mark shows my indecision.  The mathematical 
; interest is certainly there, and would rate about an 8, but take 
; this math interest away and the artistic value falls short of 
; FOTD reference standard.
; 
; The redeeming feature is the super-fast calculation time of 50 
; seconds, which will give no one a reason to regret the wasted 
; time if the image falls flat with them.
; 
; To view the image without the bother of calculating it, visit 
; the FOTD web site at:

; 
; Conditions were windy here at Fractal Central today.  The gusts 
; near 50mph, 80kph kept the leaves swirling.  Otherwise the 
; partly cloudy skies and temperature of 64F 18C were harmless.  
; The fractal cats were also pretty harmless, sleeping as they did 
; through a good part of the afternoon.
; 
; FL and I stopped by a local 'occupy' demonstration around noon.  
; Somehow I found myself holding a we're-not-going-to-take-it-any-
; longer sign and getting honked at by passing cars.  Luckily, no 
; harm was done to my middle-of-the-road political reputation, 
; since all sides apparently agree on the same problem, if not the 
; solution.  We then spent the rest of the day on a short 
; antiquing expedition.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours. 
; Until then, take care, and when the time is right, the answers 
; will become obvious.
