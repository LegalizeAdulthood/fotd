; FOTD -- October 30, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image continues the exploration of the phantom valley in 
; the Z^3-(0.355(Z^4))+C parent fractal, which in its depths is 
; quite filled with normal quadratic minibrots, while nearer its 
; surface chaotic minibrots prevail.
; 
; At a magnitude of over 10^11, today's image lies much deeper in 
; the valley than the previous scenes.  Down here, most minibrots 
; are quadratic, though I would not be surprised to find one of a 
; different order.
; 
; The name "Altocumulus Circle" came to mind when I saw a small 
; patch of altocumulus clouds in the sky this morning, then 
; noticed that the puffy elements in today's image somewhat 
; resemble the clouds.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 is what I consider the image to be worth.  
; The extra half point is a perhaps too-liberal reward for my 
; coloring work
; 
; As will be the case until the dedicated fractal computer is 
; running again, or I find another speedier fractal computer, the 
; calculation time of 40 seconds is a reasonable estimate.  This 
; time is brief enough to cause temporal distress to no one.

; 
; After yesterday's big snow here at Fractal Central, today dawned 
; clear and bright.  The warm autumn sun and temperature of 46F 
; +8C cut down considerably on the slushy snow, but by afternoon 
; several inches were still on the grassy areas.  The fractal cats 
; decided it is too early for snow and spent the day curled on the 
; couch.
; 
; Meanwhile the humans had a reasonable day.  The snow removal was 
; made easier by the sun, and I gave the sun ample time to do its 
; work before thinking about the ice.  FL finally admitted that 
; gardening season is over.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and if neutrinos are tachyons, 
; then time travel into the past might be possible.  If this is 
; true, then the next FOTD might have been posted 24 hours ago.  
; Fractalists who are more rational might sometimes wonder if I 
; take this time travel stuff, or any of the other alien or ghost 
; stuff, very seriously.  Actually, I take very few things very 
; seriously, but there must have been something real to create 
; such a vast quantity of folklore.
; 
; But to be serious for a moment, the next FOTD will be posted 24 
; hours in the future.
