; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The math expression that was iterated to create today's image is 
; Z^2+C, the same expression that gives us the well-known classic 
; Mandelbrot set with all its perturbed sets, as well as all the 
; Julia sets.  Yet the image is clearly nothing at all like a 
; Mandelbrot set, pure or perturbed, nor does it resemble any 
; Julia set.  This is because it is a slice through the Z^2+C 
; Julibrot in what I call the Rectangular direction, which is 
; defined by imag-C,imag-Z.  The rectangular shape of the slice 
; shows why I call this particular orientation the Rectangular 
; direction, and also explains the name I gave to the image -- 
; "Rectangular Reason".
; 
; The large open area that fills a good part of the frame is a 
; different view of the main bay of the M-set.  The narrow bluish 
; stripes running horizontally at the top and bottom of the open 
; area are what I call 'bridges'.  In this case they are sideways 
; views of the west branches of the valleys leading to the large 
; north and south period-3 buds of the M-set.  The horizontal open 
; areas above and below these 'bridges' are sideways views of the 
; buds themselves.
; 
; I gave no rating to the image, since almost all its interest is 
; in its mathematics.  But don't downplay the math interest.  To 
; make things much clearer than I can explain in words, gradually 
; decrease the value of the real(p1) parameter from 90 to zero in 
; increments.  (Keep the imag(p2) parameter unchanged.)  The 
; images are very fast and the process will take little time.  By 
; the time the value is reduced to 50 the destination will be 
; apparent.  Doing a 360-degree rotation would make an interesting 
; animation, but I doubt that I'll get the chance.  (Decreasing 
; the imag(p2) parameter of today's image to zero while leaving 
; the real(p1) parameter unchanged brings us to the Elliptic 
; orientation, but that's another story.)
; 
; To create today's image, I oriented the 4-D Julibrot figure so 
; that the imaginary Z-axis is perpendicular to the Mandelbrot set 
; on the screen and ignored the parts of the Julibrot that did not 
; fit into our 3-space, leaving an imaginary invisible 3-D slice 
; of the Julibrot intersecting the screen.  Then I rotated the 
; screen image around the line perpendicular to the X-axis at the 
; point -0.2.  The resulting image is what would be seen by a 
; viewer located in the plane of the screen just to the left or 
; right of the screen when the invisible 3-D slice was sliced at 
; the point of -0.2 on the real-C axis.
; 
; All this talk does not mean the image is a slow one.  In fact, 
; it finishes in a lightning fast 5 seconds.
; 
; The finished image is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is available at.

; 
; Heavy clouds and a temperature of 50F 10C made today a day to be 
; forgotten here at Fractal Central.  The occasional showers 
; helped none at all.  And the experts assure us that more rain is 
; on the way tomorrow.  The fractal cats always live in the 
; present, so they usually forget a day's events at the first 
; stroke of midnight.  Many humans are not so forgetful.  They 
; hold long term grudges and resentments that fester until war 
; breaks out.  FL and I fall between the cats and the long-term 
; resenters.
; 
; The next FOTD, a continuing adventure in 4-D hyperspace, will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and I just read that 
; there is some evidence that the sub-atomic particles known as 
; neutrinos might travel faster than the speed of light.  The 
; claim is not yet confirmed, (In fact, I doubt it), but if this 
; proves to be true, then neutrinos can move backward in time.  
; This would surely play havoc with our scientifically accepted 
; ideas of an effect following its cause, but after a century of 
; relativity and quantum mechanics, we should not be so surprised 
; when we find one more thing that violates our common-sense view 
; of reality.
