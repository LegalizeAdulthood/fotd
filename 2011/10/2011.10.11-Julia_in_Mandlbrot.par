; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows Julia sets of a point on the west shore 
; line of the large period-3 north bud of the Mandelbrot set.  I 
; say Julia *sets* because the image is filled with countless 
; Julia sets.  All the tiny orangish things spotting the deep blue 
; background are smaller Julia sets.  But don't bother checking 
; them.  They all appear the same as the large set filling the 
; frame.
; 
; The image is actually a scene in a 'perturbed' Mandelbrot set.  
; The perturbed sets are slices through the Julibrot in the 
; Mandelbrot orientation, but they have starting points other than 
; 0,0.  (For some reason, the type=mandel formula starts the 
; points at the square root of the value assigned the parameters, 
; but IMO, the formula is so fast that this is only a tiny, easily-
; worked-around flaw.)
; 
; In this particular area of this particular perturbed set, the 
; low-iteration stuff appears to be moth-eaten, filled with holes 
; of varying size, while the high-iteration stuff remains mostly 
; hidden beneath the low-iteration stuff, with only small patches 
; showing through the moth-holes.  The curious thing is that the 
; moths who ate the holes were very well-educated, and ate holes 
; in the shape of Julia sets.
; 
; To see the true Julia set of this area, reset the parameters 
; to 0,0 and, without waiting for the image to finish, strike the 
; space bar twice.  A skeletal Julia set will result.  At this 
; point, reset the logmap to 1 to see the surface Julia set or 
; leave the logmap at minus-4375 and do an inzoom or two to reveal 
; another version of the large Julia set that appears in today's 
; FOTD lurking in the depths, just a bit too small to be visible 
; at the surface.
; 
; The name "Julia in Mandelbrot" accurately describes today's 
; image.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is a bit low to fully justify the 7-1/4 
; minutes required to run the parameter file.
; 
; To avoid all this tedious calculation, check the finished image 
; on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Or check the high definition at:

; 
; Morning fog and afternoon sun earned mixed reviews for the 
; weather in the Fractal Central area today.  The temperature of 
; 79F 26C was about as perfect as it can get however.  The fractal 
; cats were apparently energized by the perfection, and spent a 
; good part of the afternoon playing hide and seek games on the 
; book shelves in the hallway.
; 
; The humans, who always knew the location of one another, spent 
; the day dreaming of things to come, such as the next glorious 
; FOTD, which will be posted in under 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and from what I read in a magazine recently, the Limerick:
; 
;        A crusty old codger named bright,
;        Could travel must faster than light.
;           He took off one day,
;           In a relative way,
;        And came back on the previous night.
; 
; just might be true.
