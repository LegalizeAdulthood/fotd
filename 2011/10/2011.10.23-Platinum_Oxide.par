; 
; FOTD -- October 22, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The October 22 image is late because I spent extra time today 
; trying to get the 2000mhz fractal computer to run.  The machine 
; has always been questionable, and this morning, when it came on 
; with a blue 'something's wrong' screen, I decided to try only 
; one more time to get it running.  Reseating all the cards did 
; nothing, so I said farewell to the 9-year-old 2000mhz unit, 
; stored it in the closet, and brought the 13-year-old 200mhz 
; machine out of retirement.
; 
; The older machine booted up perfectly, and now has the position 
; of honor on the fractal desk top, where it will remain until 
; replaced by the next currently active machine to be retired.  
; The failed machine will live on however through its video card, 
; which handles the Fractint DOS video modes perfectly, and which 
; I will install in the replacement machine.
; 
; Today's image is a quickie that I found on the old fractal 
; computer after the newer unit stopped working.  The very fast 
; image is a mixture of Z^2 and Z^5 created by the FinDivBrot-2 
; formula.  The rating of a 7.5 includes an unusual 1.5-point 
; bonus for my coloring work.  The basic fractal shape has 
; appeared several times previously as FOTD's, but I did devote a 
; considerable time to achieve the slate-gray effect, which was 
; only inspired by the program and needed much hand work.
; 
; The central shape is filled with quintic minibrots, all of which 
; are virtually identical and not worth the trip down.  The parent 
; minibrot is one of those deceptive Mandelbrot sets that at first 
; glance appears normal, but develops more quintic-like features 
; the deeper one dives into it.
; 
; The name "Platinum Oxide" refers to the overall color cast.
; 
; The calculation time of 35 seconds is an estimate.  The image 
; actually took 2 minutes and 13 seconds on the 200mhz unit.  On 
; the 2000mhz machine, which runs 4 times, (not 10 times}, as 
; fast, I assume it would finish in 35 seconds.
; 
; The already-calculated image is available on the official FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original, now classic web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today's weather here at Fractal Central was a repeat of 
; yesterday's, with more dry but dark clouds, raw winds and a 
; temperature of 52F 11C.  The fractal cats took the day in 
; stride, and were distracted only by a major cat fight that broke 
; out in the back yard when two prowling tomcats crossed paths.  
; The humans had a routine day, though I became quite annoyed when 
; the 2000mhz fractal computer went on the blink again.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and the most qualified does not always win.
