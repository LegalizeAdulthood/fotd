; FOTD -- October 17, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is the third one created with an exponent of 
; 1.05, though today it is positive Z rather than negative Z that 
; we raise to the power of 1.05.  The parent fractal was created 
; by calculating the expression Z^(1.05)+C at a level of 0.31... 
; turns down the complex logarithmic hyperspiral with the 'recip' 
; function applied.
; 
; The surprise in the image is the existence of a minibrot.  The 
; minibrot lies at the center of a disorganized spiral, which is 
; another surprise.  Most spirals appear boring because they 
; continue unchanged all the way down to infinity; today's spiral 
; however comes to a definite end at the central minibrot.
; 
; I named the image "Bare Singularity".  I almost named it 
; 'neutron star', but the singularity name has more impact.  I'm 
; not sure a bare singularity could actually exist.  Any 
; singularity would necessarily have an event horizon around it, 
; and would therefore lie unseen inside a black hole, but it is 
; fun to try to imagine what a bare singularity might look like.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is about what the image is worth.  A little 
; extra effort on the colors might have rased the rating to a 
; 7-1/2.
; 
; The calculation time of 7 minutes starts to drag before the 
; image is finished.  Avoid the dragging by viewing the image on 
; the web site.
; 
; The official FOTD web site is at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted.
; 
; or the high-definition web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original web site may be accessed at:

; 
; Light rain fell during the night here at Fractal Central, but by 
; daybreak the sky was clear.  The rest of the day brought full 
; sun with only a few passing clouds, and a temperature of 64F 
; 18C.  The fractal cats approved of these conditions, at least 
; during the times when they were not distracted by a large orange 
; tomcat that wandered onto the back porch.  The world of the 
; humans featured only routine stuff not worth reporting.
; 
; The next FOTD is due to be posted in 24 hours.  Most likely it 
; will be posted on schedule.  Until then, take care, and if 
; nothing can escape from an (almost) black hole, how does the 
; gravity get out?
