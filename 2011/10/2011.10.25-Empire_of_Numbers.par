; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- October 25, 2011 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's rather harmless image is named "Empire of Numbers".  The 
; name refers to the entire world of fractals, whose building 
; blocks are the abstractions we call numbers.  And for all I 
; know, the name might refer to the 'real' world as well.  The 
; building blocks of the 'real' world are atomic 'particles', and 
; any serious book on quantum theory soon leaves the impression 
; that these 'particles' resemble numbers rather than the tiny 
; electrically-charged billiard balls that usually come to mind.  
; Unfortunately, the 6.5 quality of the image fails to live up to 
; the magnificence of the idea that the universe is made of 
; numbers.
; 
; The image lies in the Z^(2.02)+C Mandeloid as it appears one 
; level down the complex logarithmic hyperladder (hyperspiral) 
; with the 'recip' function applied.  This parent fractal is a 
; fairly normal Mandelbrot set rotated about 30 degrees CCW so 
; that the main spike shoots out toward the WSW.  Today's image 
; lies in a clump of debris piled along the negative X-axis, just 
; north of the large period-2 bud of the rotated parent.
; 
; The rating of a 6.5 is all I could manage for the image.  There 
; is nothing really wrong with it, but neither is there anything 
; outstanding.  Additional color work might have raised the rating 
; to a 7; I failed to see enough potential to try however.  
; Curiously, in keeping with the season, the parameter file coding 
; for color registers 1, 2 and 3 is BOO.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes is an estimate.  The image 
; actually took 8-1/2 minutes to finish on the 200mhz machine.
; 
; The finished image has been posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image, rendered in high-definition, is posted at:

; 
; Sunny skies and a mild temperature of 61F 16C made today a 
; pleasant one here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats took to 
; their shelf to enjoy the warm sun, which once again streams 
; quite strongly through the southwest window on sunny days.  My 
; day was spent trying to decide whether to try to resurrect the 
; out-of-action 2000mhz fractal computer.  I finally decided to 
; put it off until tomorrow.  The machine has so many problems 
; that it would likely be a losing battle.  Until we purchase 
; the next business machine, I'll probably use the old warhorse 
; 200mhz machine (It's slow but it runs perfectly.)  Then I'll 
; convert the outdated unit to fractal duty.  The next FOTD will 
; be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and the world is 
; not quite the way it appears.
