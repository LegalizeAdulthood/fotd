; FOTD -- October 26, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Even though the desigated fractal computer is still out of 
; action, the amount of time I spent finding and creating today's 
; image must be near a record minimum.
; 
; The parent fractal came about when I combined Z^(100) with 40 
; parts of Z^(0.1) before adding straight C on every iteration.  
; This parent resembles nothing as much as the little 'pac-man' 
; game figure that was so popular back in the days when computer 
; games were still fun.  (Maybe they still are and I'm simply too 
; old-fashioned to realize it.)  A tiny Mandelbrot set lies where 
; pac-man's mouth would be located; today's image lies is a field 
; of swirling debris on the northern side of this tiny M-set.
; 
; The image is unusual because of the unusual curvilinear elements 
; surrounding the central minibrot.  Most of the coloring effect 
; was achieved by rendering the scene with the outside set to 
; 'summ' and color register 001 set to 000.
; 
; The name "A Spirit of Adventure" could apply to Stanley's 
; explorations in Africa in the 19th century.  Today however, it 
; refers to the virtual adventures in the not-quite-as-real world 
; of fractals.
; 
; When all things were considered, I rated the image at a 7.  
; After all, I have been to this area previously in FOTD history.
; 
; The image is a quick one, taking only 27 seconds on the slow 
; machine and an estimated 7 seconds on the fast one, which is 
; still out of action.  This brief time will bring no frustration 
; to those who decide that running the parameter file was a waste 
; of time.
; 
; All waste can be eliminated by viewing the finished image, which 
; has been calculated and posted to the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The classic FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Lots of clouds prevailed here at Fractal Central today, but the 
; temperature of 63F 17C kept things reasonably pleasant.  The 
; fractal cats had a day that would be considered near normal for 
; a cat.  Nicholas got himself locked into a closet for an hour or 
; so, and was not missed until he began shouting for release.  
; Cassie took advantage of his predicament by hogging the window 
; shelf for herself.
; 
; The human beings had another in a long string of busy but otherwise 
; uneventful days.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and how is it possible for consciousness to arise 
; in a universe that has no consciousness already built in?
