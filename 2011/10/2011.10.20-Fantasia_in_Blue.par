; FOTD -- October 20, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we return to the warhorse formula, the MandAutoCritInZ, 
; where we check the parent fractal created when 3 negative parts 
; of Z^(neg(sqrt2)) are combined with 1.5 negative parts of 
; Z^(2*(neg(sqrt2))) and (1/C) is added on every iteration.
; 
; This parent consists of two large bays, one on each side of the 
; X-axis, with a large minibrot-filled field of debris scattered 
; to the east.  Today's image lies in a smaller patch of chaos 
; just south of a large bud on the east side of the large north 
; bay.
; 
; Two tricks were involved in creating the effects in the image.  
; To begin, I reduced the bailout radius to an unusually small 7, 
; then I rendered the resulting image and its ballooning elements 
; with the 'outside' set to 'tdis'.
; 
; The name "Fantasia in Blue" was inspired by the overall blue 
; cast of the image, though I have toned the blue down a bit since 
; naming the image.  The rating of an 8 is what I felt the image 
; was worth at the time I rated it.  The calculation time of 3-1/2 
; minutes is well within reason.
; 
; To avoid all calculation hassle, view the finished image on the 
; official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; And view it in high definition at:

; 
; Saturday was ruled by heavy clouds here at Fractal Central, 
; though the rain for the most part stayed to the west.  The 
; fractal cats, who pay far less attention to the weather than the 
; humans, ignored the temperature of 57F 14C and had a lazy day, 
; taking turns sleeping on the new chair instead of fighting for 
; it.
; 
; The humans, FL and I, had an uneventful day also.  With the 
; graphic design work slowing down, more and more days are 
; becoming uneventful.  The one thing not slowing down however is 
; the FOTD, which I now have more time to work on.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if the 
; climate changes, will the change be for the better or worse?
