; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In these FOTD discussions I often mention the parent fractal of 
; an image.  In most cases, this parent fractal is the image that 
; appears on the screen when the formula parameters are entered 
; and nothing is changed.  My default settings are: a magnitude of 
; 0.66..., the default color palette, a maxiter of 1500, a 
; periodicity of 6 and a logmap of zero.
; 
; Sometimes an outzoom is needed to fit an entire oversized parent 
; onto the screen, or an inzoom is needed to enlarge an undersized 
; parent to fill the screen.  In other cases, there is no limited 
; fractal that could be called a parent fractal.  The entire 
; parent fractal appears to be of unlimited size.  Today's image 
; is one of these misfits.
; 
; Today's image lies in the apparently infinite fractal that is 
; created by the MandNewt06 formula.  This can be demonstrated by 
; repeatedly outzooming from the image until the limit of Fractint 
; is reached.  Even way out here, there is no sign of the fractal 
; coming to an end.
; 
; As for the image itself, it reminds me of blue clouds caught 
; evaporating away to reveal a universe of brownish spheres 
; loosely arranged into nets and spirals.  I rated the image at 
; an 8, a full point of which is a bonus for the coloring effort 
; needed to get reasonable smoothness from 256 colors.
; 
; The name "Evaporation" refers to the bluish clouds, which to me 
; appear to be clearing away, perhaps after a fractal storm.  The 
; calculation time of just over a minute will bring grief to no 
; one if, in their opinion, the image lays an egg.
; 
; For a little fun, try changing the exponent part of the real(p4) 
; parameter a few orders of magnitude in either direction and 
; watch the blue cloud totally evaporate or thicken.
; 
; The already-calculated image is available on the official FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>

; 
; Typical October weather prevailed here at Fractal Central today, 
; which made for a not too pleasant afternoon.  The sun was 
; blocked most of the time by dark lumpy clouds scudding from the 
; west, (stratocumulus), which dropped occasional sprinkles, while 
; the temperature remained stuck in the mid 50's F around 12C, and 
; the wind gusted to 20mph, 30kph.  Not being weather wise, the 
; fractal cats ignored the marginal conditions and concentrated on 
; deciding who would own the new chair.  FL put a heavy afghan 
; over the chair to thwart their scratching efforts while they 
; bickered for ownership.
; 
; The next in the apparently unending series of fractal images 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if I 
; don't exhaust the supply of fractals in this world, I'll keep 
; finding them in the next.  But I still wonder how I'll continue 
; posting them to the list.
