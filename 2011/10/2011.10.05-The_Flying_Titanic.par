; FOTD -- October 05, 2011 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates only a 4, hardly up to FOTD standards, but 
; the scene is so funny that I felt obliged to make it FOTD for 
; today.  To me the scene shows the ghost of the long-lost ship 
; HMS 'Titanic', barely visible through the mists, sailing calmly 
; over some far-away heavenly sea.  Unlike that other ghost ship, 
; the 'Dutchman', a sighting of this ship does not portend 
; disaster.  It is an omen of good fortune.  The name "The Flying 
; Titanic" gives recognition to both ghost ships.
; 
; (Well, maybe the ship in today's image does resemble something 
; more like a small destroyer than a mighty ocean liner, but at 
; least it's something better than a tugboat.)
; 
; The scene is located in the East Valley area of the large 
; minibrot on the main stem of the Mandelbrot set.  It is oriented 
; in 4-D space at an angle that would be impossible to describe, 
; and is stretched and skewed beyond imagining, yet here it is, a 
; very recognizable image of a ghostly ship passing silently in 
; the night fog.
; 
; The image is an example of serendipity.  When I stumbled upon 
; the hole that resembles a ship, I was searching for something 
; entirely different.  I still am searching in fact, and if I find 
; it, I will make it tomorrow's FOTD.
; 
; Today's image finishes in 6-2/3 minutes, a little on the slow 
; side for a scene that rates an unusually humble 4.  But this is 
; where the FOTD web site comes to the rescue.

; 
; The space of four dimensions, in which this month's featured 
; fractal object, the Julibrot, lies, is curious in many ways, 
; especially when compared to space of three dimensions.  In 3-D 
; space only five regular polyhedrons, the five Platonic solids, 
; are possible: the tetrahedron, with four triangles as faces; the 
; cube, with six squares as faces; the octahedron, with eight 
; triangles as faces; the dodecahedron, with twelve pentagons as 
; faces; and the icosahedron, with twenty triangles as faces.
; 
; And in space of five dimensions as well as spaces of all higher 
; dimensions, the increasing numbers of lower dimensional elements 
; usually do not match up correctly, and only three regular 
; figures now called polytopes are possible.  These are the 
; analogs of the tetrahedron, cube and octahedron.  So what about 
; space of four dimensions?
; 
; Intuition suggests that also in 4-D space, only three regular 
; polytopes are possible, just as in spaces of all higher 
; dimensions.  But in this case intuition is wrong.  In space of 
; four dimensions, where the polytopes are bounded by three-
; dimensional boundaries called cells, six regular polytopes are 
; possible: the hyper-tetrahedron, bounded by five tetrahedrons; 
; the hyper-cube, (sometimes called the tesseract), bounded by 
; eight cubes; the hyper-octahedron, bounded by sixteen 
; tetrahedrons; the hyper-dodecahedron, bounded by 120 
; dodecahedrons; and the hyper-icosahedron, bounded by 600 
; tetrahedrons.  There is also a figure bounded by 24 octahedrons, 
; which has no regular analog in 3-D space, but is related to the 
; semi-regular rhombic dodecahedron.
; 
; So what would life be like in 4-D space, living on a 
; hyperspherical planet most likely subject to a dizzying double 
; rotation?  Would the stars in the 3-D sky trace out helixes?  
; Unfortunately, no such planet would be possible.  In 4-D space 
; the force of gravity would obey an inverse-cube law, making 
; stable planetary orbits impossible.  A planet would either 
; quickly spiral into its star or sail off into interstellar 
; space.  So much for fantasy.
; 
; The weather here at Fractal Central today was certainly no 
; fantasy.  We enjoyed cloudless skies and a temperature of 70F 
; 21C.  The fractal cats, now settling into winter mode, found 
; comfort on their shelf in the sunny southwest window.
; 
; The humans, FL and I, found comfort in the bright sunlight 
; streaming through the windows, which has been pretty scarce the 
; past couple months.  Even more comfort will be found when the 
; next FOTD is found and delivered, hopefully in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and the formula for the hypervolome of a 
; five-dimensional hypersphere is 8/15*(pi^2)(r^5).  Let me know 
; when this useless bit of information might become important.
