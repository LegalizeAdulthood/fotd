; FOTD -- October 23, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the East Valley of the large 
; minibrot on the main stem of the Mandelbrot set.  The parent 
; fractal is in fact a Mandelbrot set that takes on order-9 
; characteristics in its depths.
; 
; The minibrot at the center lies near a larger minibrot, which in 
; turn lies near an even larger minibrot . . . At this point I 
; lose count of the minibrots, but I think there are about four of 
; them in the ladder-chain up to the surface.
; 
; The name "A Sheep in the Deep" has no connection at all with the 
; image.  It simply popped into my head when I made my mind a 
; blank, a task I find quite easy to accomplish.
; 
; The rating of a 7 includes a full point for the coloring, which 
; took over twice as long as calculating the image.  The 
; calculation time of 3 minutes entered into the parameter file is 
; an educated guess of the time the calculation would have taken 
; on the faster but now dead machine.  (The image actually took 
; 12-1/2 minutes to finish on the slow unit.)
; 
; The finished image may be viewed on the official web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; without the need to calculate it.
; 
; The high-definition version is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original, now classic web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The morning fog cleared off by 11am here at Fractal Central 
; today, leading to a sunny afternoon with a temperature of 59F 
; 15C.  The fractal cats, still on watch for a possible return of 
; the fighting tomcats, spent the first part of the day in the 
; window facing the back yard.  But the fighters have apparently 
; moved on, and by the afternoon the fractal cats shifted their 
; watch to the sunny shelf in the southwest window, which faces 
; the front sidewalk.
; 
; The humans spent the day doing nothing, which is quite enjoyable 
; when it is done in moderation.  The next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and would this country's real 
; savior please put in an appearance.
