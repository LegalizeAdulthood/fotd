; FOTD -- October 03, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's FOTD we find ourselves roaming once again in four-
; dimensional hyperspace, as we will be all the month of October.  
; Every image this month will be created with the Mandelbrot 
; expression, Z^2+C, but none of the images will resemble the 
; usual Mandelbrot or Julia scenes.
; 
; Today's image is a view of Scepter Valley, which is the valley 
; at -1.25 on the negative X-axis of the Mandelbrot set.  This is 
; the inspiration for the name "Royal Scepter", though the image 
; looks nothing at all like the Mandelbrot or Julia aspects of 
; Scepter Valley.
; 
; The scene is sliced at an odd angle oriented 75 degrees from the 
; Rectangular direction toward the Julia direction of the 
; Julibrot figure.  The brilliant pink vertical stripe in the 
; center of the image is part of the open space between the two 
; branches of the valley, viewed from the side.
; 
; Though the mathematical interest rates higher than usual in 
; today's image, I could find nothing of artistic value in it that 
; might raise the rating above that of an average 7.  I did spend 
; some extra time on the coloring however.
; 
; In 4-D space, such as the space in which the Julibrot figure 
; lies, there are six perpendicular planes through every point.  
; Every plane is perpendicular in the normal 3-D manner 
; (intersecting in a line) to four other planes, and absolutely 
; perpendicular (intersecting in only a single point) to one other 
; plane.  In the Julibrot the absolutely perpendicular pairs of 
; planes are Mandelbrot-Julia, Rectangular-Parabolic, and 
; Oblate-Elliptic.  All other pairs of planes lie in the same 
; 3-space and are perpendicular in the normal 3-D manner.
; 
; Today's image is oriented between the Rectangular and Julia 
; directions, which implies that the rotation is of the normal 3-D 
; kind.  In this case, the axis of rotation is the imag(z) line 
; that intersects the M-set at -1.25 of the X-axis.
; 
; In today's image, the rotation may be seen in progress by 
; varying the real(p2) parameter between zero and 90, which takes 
; us on a trip from the Rectangular to the Julia directions.  But 
; be warned, the calculation time increases dramatically as the 
; value of real(p2) gets close to 90.
; 
; The higher dimensions have always been a mystery, but over the 
; years I have come to see 3-D space as a construct of the mind, 
; and also as an indicator of our level of consciousness.  We can 
; not imagine spaces of four or more dimensions because we have 
; not yet reached a level of consciousness where it is possible.
; 
; Will the human race eventually evolve to a level where higher 
; spatial dimensions are within our grasp?  Will we then find 
; ourselves in a world with four or more spatial dimensions?  
; Physicists tell us that the higher dimensions (11 at the latest 
; count) are there, but we cannot percieve them.  If this is so, 
; who knows what mysteries the universe yet holds.
; 
; These questions will not be answered in today's image, but the 
; image does calculate in only one brief minute.  The image will 
; make the questions just a bit more significant however.
; 
; The inconvenience of calculating a parameter file may be avoided 
; by viewing the completed image on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
;

; 
; Heavy clouds continued here at Fractal Central today, with a 
; very autumnal temperature of 54F 12C.  The fractal cats, solidly 
; in cold weather mode, spent the day doing warm things such as 
; curling up on the blankets.  FL and I, the local humans, spent 
; the day keeping things running, which is not always as simple as 
; it first appears.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Who knows where in 
; the Z^2+C Julibrot figure we might find ourselves tomorrow, or 
; what we might find there.  Until then, take care, and is three-
; dimensional physical reality really real?
