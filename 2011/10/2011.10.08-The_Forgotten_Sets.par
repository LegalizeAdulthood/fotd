; FOTD -- October 07, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows one of the forgotten sets -- those that 
; lie in the Julibrot at orientations other than the Julia or 
; Mandelbrot.  Today's image happens to lie in the Oblate 
; direction, which is determined by the imag(c) and real(z) 
; axes of the Julibrot, and is a name of my own invention.
; 
; The image is a sideways view of Seahorse Valley of the large 
; minibrot on the main spike of the largest minibrot on the main 
; spike of the Mandelbrot set.  The scene is not centered in the 
; Mandelbrot plane however.  It is located at a distance of 
; -1.786117 in the real(z) direction, which means it is part of 
; the shadow M-set, a phantom set with a linear size 1.4142 times 
; that of the classic M-set.
; 
; The name "The Forgotten Sets" gives recognition to the sets in 
; the four odd planes of the Julibrot figure, as well as those in 
; the countless rotations.  In fact, calling these things 'sets' 
; is basically a mistake.  All Z^2+C fractals including the 
; Mandelbrot set are mere 2-D slices through a far more monstrous 
; figure -- the 4-D Julibrot.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is getting to be boring, but I must rate the 
; fractals as I see them, and today's impresses me as being of 
; only average quality for a FOTD.
; 
; The calculation time of 54 seconds will pass quickly, even 
; though not in a flash.
; 
; If the official FOTD web site host can recover from the hack 
; attack, the finished image will soon be posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; It will also be posted, and in high definition at that, at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original and now classic web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Absolute perfection prevailed here at Fractal Central today.  
; Both the humans and the fractal cats agreed, enjoying the day as 
; much as possible.  With a large anticyclone, (one of those 
; things with an 'H' in the center that the TV weather people put 
; on their maps), parked right overhead, not a single cloud was 
; seen and the temperature reached a very pleasant 68F 20C.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and if neutrinos really do exceed the speed of light as 
; claimed in a recent issue of 'Time' Magazine, what would happen 
; if we sent a burst of them to the moon, where they would be 
; reflected back to earth?  As I see it, they would return a few 
; seconds before they were sent and could then trigger a device 
; that would cause them not to be sent out in the first place.  
; Faster-than-light neutrinos would also give a glimmer of 
; scientific respect to the paranormal claim of precognition, a 
; currently 'impossible' thing that I already know does in fact 
; exist.  This does not imply that I put faith in the ramblings 
; of Madam Zucchini, the fortune teller down at the corner.  But 
; it does mean I am convinced that, in some strange way, the 
; future may affect the past, thus violating the law of causality.
; 
; If this makes me a superstitious true-believer in the 
; paranormal, so be it.
; 
; Now it's time for the useless information of the day.  The 
; formula for the hypervolume of the curved 5-D hypersurface of a 
; 6-D hypersphere is very simple -- (pi^3)*(radius^5).
