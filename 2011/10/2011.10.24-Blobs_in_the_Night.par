; FOTD -- October 24, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the parent fractal that results when 
; Z^(1.1) is subtracted from Z^(-5.5) and straight C is added.  
; This parent consists of a Mandeloid rotated so that its normally 
; west end points southeast.  Its main period-2 bud is quite 
; large, while its East Valley is shrunken.  A large blob 
; surrounded by fields of smaller blobs lies just beyond the east 
; valley.  The image for today lies in one of these debris fields.
; 
; I named the image "Blobs in the Night", mostly because of the 
; rather somber color scheme, which despite its brilliant 
; highlights, still creates an impression of night.  I almost 
; named it something like 'Bursting Bubbles', but decided not to 
; when I found no bubbles that are actually bursting.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is adequate, but if I had put more effort into 
; the colors, I might have raised it to an 8.
; 
; The 45-second calculation time will cause no distress.  This 
; time is an estimate of the time the image would take to finish 
; on the 2000mhz machine.  It took 2-1/2 minutes on the 200mhz 
; unit.
; 
; The official FOTD web site, still under construction, may be 
; accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The FOTD images are posted in high definition and sometimes 
; anti-aliased at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site, now classic, may be found at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A few too many clouds and a few drops of rain spoiled the day 
; here at Fractal Central.  The temperature of 59F 15C was a bit 
; chilly for total comfort, but near average for the season.  The 
; fractal cats spent the day on watch for an orange lop-eared 
; tomcat that has recently appeared in the area and is showing 
; signs of hanging around a while.
; 
; The humans spent the day doing what needed to be done, which 
; kept us busy but would be very boring to report in detail.  The 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and if the hardships of life are a learning experience as the 
; local armchair philosopher says, when will we make use of the 
; material world skills that we have struggled so hard to learn?
