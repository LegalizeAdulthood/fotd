; 
; FOTD -- November 28, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Due to the seasonal rush here at Fractal Central, today's 
; discussion will be a brief one.
; 
; Today's image is the 4th and final scene in the same parent 
; fractal.  It is located on the western shore line of the main 
; bay of the parent, just north of the pseudo-East Valley.
; 
; I rated the image at a 7, a good part of which is due to the 
; coloring.
; 
; When I thought of the name "Flight of Numbers" I was thinking of 
; how the entire image is made of numbers.  Then my thoughts 
; turned to how the quantum realm is little more than the math 
; that describes it.  And finally, since an object must share the 
; qualities of its building blocks, I considered how the 'real' 
; world might very well be made of numbers also.
; 
; The listed calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes is a guestimate of 
; the time the image would take to finish on the 2000mhz machine.  
; It actually took just under 10 minutes on the 200mhz machine.
; 
; (BTW, the 2000mhz unit still does not work, but it is coming up 
; with some rather strange ever-changing messages before it shuts 
; down.  I'll send some of them in a day or two, but I suspect 
; that the 'C' drive disk might be scrambled in addition to the 
; other problems.)
; 
; Today's image has already been calculated and is posted on the 
; official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Yesterday brought a mix of sun and clouds, and a temperature of 
; 55F 13C to Fractal Central.  Today brought more clouds than sun 
; and an even milder temperature of 64F 18C.  The fractal cats 
; took things as they happened.  The only excitement took place 
; this morning, when a tough beat-up old tomcat passed through the 
; back yard, spraying as he went.  Nicholas wanted to go out and 
; show the cat who's boss; Cassie found the tough old cat 
; interesting.
; 
; FL, who is just getting into the holiday mode, spent yesterday 
; preparing for the events.  I spent the day counting the days 
; until the holidays are over.  The next FOTD will almost 
; certainly be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if 
; you're a skeptic and you see a ghost, rush to a psych to find 
; what caused you to have the hallucination.
