; 
; FOTD -- November 07, 2011 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Because of its almost lifelike appearance, today's image rates a 
; whopping 9.5.  I did not want to give it a perfect 10 because I 
; could see a few areas that needed a bit more work.  But 
; regardless of whether the rating is a 10 or a 9.5, the image is 
; still (IMO) the best in quite a while.
; 
; The scene lies on the X-axis of the ridiculous fractal that 
; results when some Z^(-100) gets mixed into an everyday 
; Mandelbrot set.  Well, that's not exactly what the formula does, 
; but regardless, the result is a fractal with Z^(-100) features 
; and Z^2 features mixed together in a strange but pleasing way.
; 
; The parent fractal resembles nothing as much as a Mandelbrot set 
; squeezed inside a nest of cogwheels, with its main stem missing 
; and its large bud flattened.  Today's scene lies in the East 
; Valley of the shattered M-set.
; 
; I have just started to explore the minus-minus fractals created 
; by the FinDivBrot-2 formula, and have found that the fractals in 
; this range are very sensitive to the bailout radius.  Today's 
; bailout is actually a rather critical 1.25 -- (the negative 
; 14.75 entered as real[p2] plus the 16 automatically added to 
; this parameter by the formula).  If this value is changed even a 
; little, the image totally changes, and not for the better.
; 
; The name "Sparkling Minibrot" came about when the image reminded 
; me of sparkling water.  Most of the effect of sparkling water 
; was created by rendering the scene with the outside set to 
; 'fmod' and a proximity factor of 0.08.  The rest of the effect 
; is a result of the coloring.
; 
; The calculation time of only one minute is a real bargain price 
; for an image with a rating of 9-1/2.
; 
; And even this brief calculation time may be saved by viewing the 
; finished image on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; or by viewing the high-definition version at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And don't forget the original FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Once the morning fog cleared away, the near-perfect autumn 
; weather continued here at Fractal Central today, with almost 
; totally clear skies and a temperature of 57F 14C.  The fractal 
; cats were pleased with the weather, but not so pleased with a 
; lop-eared orange tomcat that is prowling and spraying in the 
; neighborhood.  When the intruder passed through the yard and 
; sprayed the decorative cat garden ornament, Cassie gave him a 
; good growl, (from the safety of the indoors).
; 
; The day of the humans, (that's what they tell us we are,) was 
; uneventful.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and there is a corollary that follows from 
; yesterday's closing comment about disbelief of truth . . . The 
; stronger the evidence that a thing is untrue, the greater the 
; number of people who will believe it.
