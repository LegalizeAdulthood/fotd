; FOTD -- November 17, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Most everyone is familiar with the so-called 'Let's make a Deal' 
; paradox, which is really no paradox at all.  You do not have 
; a 50-50 chance of making the correct choice when one of the 
; other doors is eliminated, you have a 67-percent chance of 
; winning by switching your choice to the remaining door.  The 
; true mystery is the fact that it is so hard to explain to others 
; why this must be true.  (See below for my attempt to explain it.)
; 
; For a real paradox, check today's image, which is a scene in the 
; left-over debris in the southwest part of the largest bud of the 
; minibrot on the west branch of the filament extending from the 
; large period-3 north bud on the main bay of the Mandelbrot set.  
; The minibrot is in the process of morphing from a quadratic into 
; a near-circular order-15 one.
; 
; So far, so good.  But things go quite awry when we start 
; counting.  Normal, well-adjusted order-15 minibrots have 14 
; lobes and are surrounded by rings of 15 elements, but the 
; minibrots in today's image are anything but normal.  begin with 
; the minibrot in the upper left corner.  A careful count reveals 
; the expected 14 lobes.  But now count the surrounding elements, 
; and surprisingly, you will find 16, not the proper 15.
; 
; This is only the start of the craziness.  The large minibrot in 
; the center of the scene is apparently a merging of two order-15 
; minibrots, and as such should have 28 lobes.  Unfortunately, 
; when I counted, I found 29.  It's quite a mystery where the 
; extra lobe comes from.  I have not yet tried to count the 
; elements surrounding this merged minibrot, but I doubt that they 
; equal the expected 30.
; 
; The name "Paradox Country" refers to this paradoxical craziness.
; 
; The rating of 7-1/2 is all I could do for the image.  The longer 
; I see the colors, the harsher and muddier they appear.  If it 
; were not for the math interest, the image would rate something 
; more like a 6.
; 
; The calculation time of just under 2 minutes will pass quickly, 
; bringing only minor restless eye syndrome.
; 
; The finished image is posted for instant gratification at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; It is posted in high definition at:

; 
; As I wrote at the start of this discussion, the 'Let's Make a 
; Deal' paradox is no paradox at all.  When you choose a door, you 
; have a 2/3 chance of having chosen a losing door.  This means 
; there is a 2/3 chance that one of the other 2 doors is the 
; winning door.  When one of the other doors is shown to be a 
; loser, nothing has changed with your original choice.  There is 
; still a 2/3 chance that it is a loser, but now the 2/3 chance 
; that one of the other 2 doors is the winner has been combined 
; into one door, which now has a 2/3 likelihood of being the 
; winner.  So switch your choice to the other door and your chance 
; of winning will jump from 33 percent to 67 percent.
; 
; The clouds continued today here at Fractal Central, while the 
; weather remained dry.  The fractal cats (of the escape-time 
; variety) thought the temperature of 48F +9C should have been 
; much warmer.
; 
; The fractal people made it through the day with only minor 
; inconveniences.  Now that the commercial work is winding down, 
; the things that once were larger inconveniences now seem less 
; inconvenient.  The next FOTD will conveniently be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and always choose the other door.
