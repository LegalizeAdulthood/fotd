; FOTD -- November 20, 2011 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Perhaps the most striking feature of today's image is the name I 
; gave it.  "Peanuts in the Knight" is the first phrase that came 
; to mind when I shut off rational thought in search of an 
; interesting name.  Since the name found me rather than me 
; finding it, I have no logical connection between the name and 
; the image other than the vaguely peanut-shaped holes surrounding 
; the minibrot.  And nothing that I can see in the image even 
; hints at a noble knight of long ago.  I also doubt that peanuts 
; were on a knight's list.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image came about when I subtracted 
; two parts of Z^(1.5) from Z^(2) on every iteration before adding 
; (C).  This parent fractal, which lies totally in positive real 
; territory, is a Mandelbrot set with a reasonably normal main bay 
; east of Seahorse Valley, but when we pass west of Seahorse 
; Valley, where the circular period-2 main bud would be expected, 
; we find a surprising north-south series of three partially 
; merged buds.  Today's image lies near the X-axis on the western 
; edge of this series of buds.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is all I could do for the image.  I could have 
; spent more time on the coloring, but I saw too little potential 
; to make the effort.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/3 minutes is near average for a FOTD 
; image.
; 
; The official FOTD web site with the pre-calculated image may be 
; accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version of the image is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and the original FOTD wen site may be found at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A mix of sun and clouds prevailed here at Fractal Central today. 
; The fractal cats enjoyed the sun more than the clouds, and had 
; no comment on the temperature of 55F 13C, which was quite mild 
; for mid-November.  My day was reasonable enough to please a 
; rationalist, yet weird enough to satisfy a believer in aliens 
; in flying saucers from outer space.  FL, being of a far more 
; pragmatic nature, had a day with a minimum of un-necessary 
; speculation.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and stay sharp when life turns dull.
