; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- November 30, 2011 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today is the last day of November, and we end the month with 
; an image that rates a full 8-1/2.  The image lies in the parent 
; fractal that results when negative Z and (1/Z) are combined and 
; straight C is added on every iteration.
; 
; This parent fractal is little more than a cut-off hyperbola with 
; its open end facing north and Mandelbrot buds along its edges.  
; Today's scene is located in some curious debris just inland of 
; the southernmost part of the hyperbolic main bay, which appears 
; to be an East Valley.
; 
; (To see a surprising cousin of today's scene, change the signs 
; of the real and imag parts of the p1 and p2 parameters, and 
; change the sign of the Y center coordinate.  The resulting image 
; has a different orientation as well as a similar yet somewhat 
; different coloring.) 
; 
; The unusually high rating of an 8.5 is due to the extra effort I 
; put into the coloring.  I was actually considering a rating of a 
; 9, but finally decided that the image too closely resembles 
; yesterday's for such a rating.
; 
; The name "Nothing is Something" came about when I started 
; thinking of empty space, which modern physicists tell us is 
; anything but empty.
; 
; The image takes almost 5 minutes to finish, but the result will 
; be worth the wait.
; 
; The wait may be avoided by visiting the official FOTD web site 
; and viewing the finished image there.  The web site may be 
; accessed at:

; 
; Today began with heavy clouds here at Fractal Central.  The 
; clouds thinned as the day progressed but never cleared totally 
; away.  The temperature of 46F +8C was too cold for the fractal 
; cats, who were more interested in a new cat that has been 
; prowling in the vicinity lately.  The humans spent the day doing 
; the things that humans do to fill the days.
; 
; Unless the world ends, the next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours. 
; Until then, take care, and it must be a rough time for born-
; again rational skeptics.  With the TV channels filled with shows 
; about ghosts and the nonsensical nature of the sub-atomic realm, 
; skeptics appear to be losing their battle to convince the world 
; that the paranormal is a delusion and save earth's population 
; from falling into superstition.
