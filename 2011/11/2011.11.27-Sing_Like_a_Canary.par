; FOTD -- November 26, 2011 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; A not-totally-unexpected shopping spree erupted Saturday here at 
; FC, which left little time for a proper fractal search.  All is 
; not lost however, for I found today's image, which is nowhere 
; near the best of all time, but is not the worst either.
; 
; The image is the third venture into the same parent fractal, 
; this time into the southern shore of the valley on the west side 
; of the main bay.  The nature of this valley is unclear, though 
; it impresses me as an 'east valley' type of thing.
; 
; The effect of overlapping bubbles was created by rendering the 
; scene with the outside set to 'fmod'.  At the moment I forget 
; exactly what 'fmod' stands for, but whatever it is, it sometimes 
; creates interesting images.
; 
; The rating of a 4 could have been several points higher if the 
; hastily-found canary-yellow background had not been so ridicu-
; lously intense.  This over-intense background is the inspiration 
; for the name "Sing Like a Canary".
; 
; The calculation time of 40 seconds is near the speed of light, 
; and will cause no impatience even for those with the shortest 
; attention spans.
; 
; Avoid the nuisance of calculating the image from the parameter 
; file by viewing it already completed on the official FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image is available in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The weather was uneventful here at Fractal Central today.  The 
; temperature of 52F 11C was close to normal.  The clouds were 
; thin enough to let some sun through, but thick enough to prevent 
; the day from being described as sunny.  The fractal cats were 
; annoyed by our absence, and did not concern themselves with 
; outside conditions.
; 
; It's the shopping season again, so FL and I did our share to 
; keep the seasonal spirit high and the merchants' cash registers 
; jingling for a good part of the day.  I really dislike shopping, 
; but I guess it's part of everyone's duty as a free citizen to go 
; out and keep the economy moving.  The next FOTD will be posted 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and the greatest illusion 
; creator of all time is the universe.  It actually has people 
; convinced that it's really out there.
