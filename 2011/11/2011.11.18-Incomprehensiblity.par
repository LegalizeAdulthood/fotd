; FOTD -- November 18, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in a filament extending from a valley on the 
; east edge of its parent fractal, which is an inverted one -- a 
; grossly oversized, near circular island surrounded by an 
; infinite ocean rather than a lake or bay surrounded by an 
; infinite continent.
; 
; I named the image "Incomprehensibility", a word that is not too 
; difficult to spell as long as one knows when to stop spelling.  
; (One of the letter 'i's did not fit in the formula-name space.)  
; At one time there was a reasonable reason for the name, but I 
; long ago forgot the reason.
; 
; The rating of an 8 seems about right for the image, with its 
; brilliant yellow-orangish features and radiating zig-zag green 
; filaments surrounded by a deep purple background.  I could not 
; give myself a bonus since the Fractint program did most of the 
; coloring work.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes is a little slow, but 
; enthusiasm will build once the rough image fills the screen.
; 
; For even more enthusiasm, the image has already been calculated 
; and posted to the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Near total sunshine prevailed here at Fractal Central today.  
; The temperature started at 30F -2C and reached a high of 46F 
; +8C.  The outside conditions felt rather chilly all day, but the 
; fractal cats, who spent most of the afternoon in the sun on 
; their shelf, were quite satisfied.
; 
; The humans made it through the day with nothing happening to 
; make the day memorable.  In other words, it was an all-right 
; day.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and when will someone prove that the world is real 
; and not simply a very stable illusion that follows the rules of 
; logic we invented to make sense of things?  Right now, all we 
; can do is assume physical reality is truly real and blithely 
; continue doing our materialistic science.
