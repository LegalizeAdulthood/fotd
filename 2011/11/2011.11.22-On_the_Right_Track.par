; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- November 22, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent of today's gaudily colored fractal is a Mandelbrot 
; set that has been corrupted by subtracting Z^(1.01) on each 
; iteration.  The result is an infinitely divided main stem, with 
; two large minibrots.  The scene of today's image lies between 
; the East Valley areas of these two minibrots, very near the 
; negative X-axis.
; 
; The overall impression the image left with me is one of a crazy 
; rail yard, with tracks running in all directions, an effect that 
; is very common in fractals with divided main spikes.  After much 
; meditation about railroading, I named the image "On the Right 
; Track".
; 
; The rating of 7-1/2 includes a half point bonus for the extra 
; work I put into the coloring.  My humility prevents me from 
; awarding myself more.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-5/6 minutes will pass swiftly once the 
; top edge of the image appears, with all its deep blues and 
; brilliant oranges.  And things will get only better as the scan 
; moves down the screen.
; 
; But to totally avoid calculation, view the completed image on 
; the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; View it in high-definition at:

; Many more images may be found on the original FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Foul weather spoiled things here at Fractal Central today, with 
; drizzle all morning and rain in the afternoon.  The temperature 
; of 45F +7C was chilly enough to keep things totally miserable.  
; The fractal cats disapproved of the wet conditions, and turned 
; their attention to examining a new easy chair that arrived this 
; morning.  The humans had a reasonably normal day, with nothing 
; of note to report.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  The postings are 
; scheduled to continue through the Thanksgiving holiday with no 
; breaks, since fractals take no holidays.  Of course, if the 
; unexpected happens, we might miss a day.  Come what may, until 
; next time, take care, and be aware of subtle differences.
