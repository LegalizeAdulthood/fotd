; FOTD -- January 18, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image differs from the usual image in that the minibrot 
; at its center is cubic rather than the much more common quad-
; ratic.  Its parent fractal is a small variation of the Z^3+C Man-
; deloid.  The variation is that the exponent is 3.001 and the 
; parent is calculated at a level 0.001 turns up the logarithmic 
; hyperspiral.  The parent fractal also is rotated 90 degrees, so 
; that it lies on its side.
; 
; As a result of all these differences, the negative X-axis cuts 
; through the valley that normally would lie at the center of the 
; large period-2 northern bud.  This valley appears as a wedge, 
; trying to split the bud down its center, and is of a type that 
; does not exist in the classic Mandelbrot set
; 
; In today's parent, the small departure from the true ground-
; level Z^3 Mandeloid causes the negative X-axis to be infinitely 
; divided, which does strange things to the parts of the fractal 
; that happen to fall there.  Exactly what kind of strangeness 
; takes place is apparent in today's image.
; 
; I named the image "Surreal Cubism", which must mean something, 
; though I doubt that it has any connection to early 20th-century 
; art forms.  The rating of a 7-1/2 includes a half-point for the 
; coloring.  The image might or might not be worth it.
; 
; The calculation time is quite brief -- under 1-3/4 minutes.  
; This will keep impatience suppressed.  The task of calculation 
; may be totally eliminated by viewing the finished image on the 
; active FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original web site may be found at:
; 
;         <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; though it is not up to date.
; 
; Bleak gray skies and a temperature around 23F -5C kept the 
; fractal cats very near the heat all day Monday here at Fractal 
; Central.  The forecast of snow overnight and ice on Tuesday 
; promises another bleak day to come.  The fractal cats are 
; unconcerned.  They live in the present, and never worry about 
; the future until it actually happens.
; 
; The Monday of the humans, (a good name for a horror movie), was 
; busier than expected, which left no time to get involved in the 
; upcoming web site.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and keep the controversy at a minimum.
