; FOTD -- January 28, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things were very hectic here at FC again on Thursday.  (And I 
; thought we were in a recession.)  But at least FL is on the 
; mend, and will likely be back in action by Friday, which will 
; relieve the pressure on me and allow more time for a proper 
; fractal search.  But most likely, we will remain in the M-set.
; 
; Today's image is another very deep scene at the end of the nega-
; tive X-axis of the Mandelbrot set.  But today, the image has a 
; difference.  The bailout radius of the M-set has been set to 3, 
; which causes the X-axis to be cut off at a point around sqrt(3). 
; The tiny minibrot at the center of the image is located very 
; near the end of this shortened main spike.
; 
; The basic equal-iteration rendering of the scene was very dull, 
; so I livened things up by rendering the scene with the outside 
; set to 'fmod'.  The result earns a rating of an honest 7.
; 
; The name "FMOD on the X-axis" simply tells it like it is.
; 
; Though the magnitude of the image is well within the range of 
; arbitrary precision math, the actual magnitude of around 10^21 
; is much less than the magnitude of the images of the past few 
; days, cutting the calculation time to a much more reasonable 
; 9-1/4 minutes.
; 
; But a calculation time of over 9 minutes is still a lot of time 
; to devote to an FOTD image.  The remedy is to surf down to the 
; active FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; where the finished image is or soon will be posted.
; 
; The original FOTD site may be accessed at:

; 
; A mix of clouds and sun, occasional flurries of snow, and a temp-
; erature just around freezing made Thursday a typical midwinter 
; day here at Fractal Central.  Two inches of fresh snow piled up 
; overnight Wednesday, but on top of the foot (30cm) or so of old 
; snow, made little difference.
; 
; The fractal cat duo tried their window shelf, but soon decided 
; the sun was too irregular, and took to the shelf over the heat.  
; With FL feeling better but still out of action, my day was 
; another hectic one, doing double duty.  Luckily, the Mandelbrot 
; set once again came to the fractal rescue with a quick image.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Most likely it will 
; be another scene in the infinitely complex and extremely fast 
; Mandelbrot set.  Until then, take care, and what is wrong with 
; the current world?  (Maybe it's that I'm nearing codgerhood.)
