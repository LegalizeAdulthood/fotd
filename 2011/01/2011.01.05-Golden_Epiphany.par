; FOTD -- January 06, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is finally one worth a rating of a 7, the level at 
; which I consider a day's effort a success.  The image is a scene 
; in the Seahorse Valley area of a hypercomplex Julia set.
; 
; Until now I have put very little, in fact, almost no effort into 
; the type=hypercomplexj fractals.  Perhaps I have been put off by 
; the eight dimensions involved, but as today's image shows, with 
; a bit of extra effort in the coloring, the hypercomplex stuff 
; can be quite interesting.
; 
; I named the image "Golden Epiphany".  In the religious calendar, 
; today is the day celebrating the arrival of the wise men from 
; the east -- astrologers who brought their gifts to the baby in 
; Bethlehem, recognizing him as a world savior.  There is also a 
; good bit of gold in the image, fully justifying the name.
; 
; Thanks to expert programming and a 2000mhz machine, the image 
; is a very fast one, finishing in a mere 35 seconds.  The most 
; convenient way to view the image is on the currently active 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; the original FOTD web site, not up to date, may be found at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The typical mix of sun and clouds prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central on Wednesday, with a typical temperature of 34F +1C.  
; The fractal cats would have preferred more sun, but satisfied 
; themselves with what sun they could find.
; 
; My day was near normal.  The standard work was out of the way by 
; early afternoon and nothing unexpected arrived.  This left the 
; time to dredge up today's image.  During the midday break, the 
; topic of my own FOTD web site came up.  FL wondered whether she 
; might add some positive philosophy to the daily FOTD discussions 
; to balance what she considers the negative stuff I write. The 
; web site will probably be up and running in a couple weeks, so I 
; told her to go ahead and write whatever she wishes.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in near 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and what could be more negative than an eternally con-
; scious brain in the middle of an otherwise empty infinite space? 
; (If it were me, I would wait for a supercomputer pre-loaded with 
; version 2,000,000 of Super-Fractint to pop out of the vacuum 
; beside me.)
