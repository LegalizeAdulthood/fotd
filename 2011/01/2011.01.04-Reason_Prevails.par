; FOTD -- January 05, 2010 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a continuation of the current series of below-
; standard FOTD images.  The rating of a 6 is certainly nothing to 
; get worked up about.  The most unusual aspect is that the image 
; was rendered with the outside set to 'fmod' and the inside set 
; to the color 253.  This trickery raises the everyday scene to a 
; level marginally worthy of being declared a FOTD.
; 
; The name "Reason Prevails" has nothing to do with the image.  It 
; came about when I caught myself trying to make sense of the 
; currently faddish (at least among some thinkers) cosmological 
; theories.
; 
; The parent fractal, which was created by the expression 
; 2.5*(Z^0.5)+0.5*(Z^2.5)+C, resembles a distorted Mandelbrot set 
; facing northwest, with a southern period-3 bud larger than its 
; main period-2 bud.  Today's scene is located on a filament 
; extending from the large period-3 bud, near the point where the 
; filament terminates in an irregular open area.  The shape of 
; this open area is mirrored in the small brilliant patches 
; scattered about today's image, which actually are open areas 
; themselves.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/5 minutes is quite brief, leaving no 
; danger that half a day will have been wasted if the result is 
; not up to expectations.  The most convenient way to view the 
; image is to hop down to the currently active FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and view the finished product there.
; 
; Paul's original FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; is currently not up to date.  But I am still waiting to hear 
; from Paul, telling me that he is once again feeling well enough 
; to start getting the site caught up.
; 
; As soon as I struck the 'send' button to send off yesterday's 
; FOTD, I wondered if I had gone too far in lambasting the disci-
; pline of science.  Even though it certainly falls short of 
; perfection, science is the best method we currently have of 
; explaining the 'how' of things of the natural world, at least at 
; the macroscopic physical level.
; 
; But it seems as though the older I grow, the more I see science 
; being mis-used.  In fact, as I see people, especially the young, 
; walking about in near trance states, totally fascinated by their 
; latest wireless internet gadgets, I see technology gone amok.  
; Then I wonder whether the progress of mankind is nearing a peak, 
; beyond which we will slip into a downward curve of regression 
; until we settle into a state of helpless zombiehood, ruled by 
; our overlords, the elite of the giant computer and communication 
; corporations.
; 
; The good news is that we had a mix of sun and clouds here at 
; Fractal Central on Tuesday, with a temperature of a pleasant 43F 
; +6C.  The fractal cats enjoyed the sun while it was shining, and 
; the heat when the sun went behind a cloud.  My day was success-
; ful enough, since I avoided a philosophical debate with FL when 
; she casually asked what I have against science.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be on 
; the winning side.
