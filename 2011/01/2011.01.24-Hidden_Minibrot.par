; 
; FOTD -- January 25, 2011 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things were quite busy again here at Fractal Central on Monday, 
; which left little time for an intensive fractal search, but the 
; war-horse Mandelbrot set again rushed to the rescue with an 
; infinitesimal minibrot in the East Valley of a larger but still 
; infinitesimal minibrot at the tip of the main spike.
; 
; Images of minibrots near the tip of the main spike are common, 
; but today's image is colored well enough to raise the image to 
; a superlative 9.  And most surprising, the colors were created 
; with a tap of the <enter> key and only a few small tweaks by 
; the human fractal tapper.
; 
; Way out here on the spike, the bailout radius has a great effect 
; on the appearance of the image.  Raising the bailout of today's 
; image to 10 totally destroys the artistic effect.  (Lowering it 
; to 3 is even worse -- the image vanishes.)
; 
; The name "Hidden Minibrot" is not the name of an upcoming 
; Chinese movie.  It refers to the minibrot at the center, which 
; does not become visible until a magnitude of 10^100 is reached.  
; Actually, I have already been down there, and can report that 
; the minibrot has potential.
; 
; One thing that could be improved is the calculation time of 
; today's image, which at 1/2 hour, is inconveniently long.  But, 
; considering the image's magnitude of over 7*(10^93), this is not 
; unreasonable.
; 
; The calculation may be forgotten by viewing the finished image 
; on the current FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; but before going there, allow a short time for Hal to calculate 
; and post the image.
; 
; The traditional FOTD web site is available at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Those wondering when my own FOTD web site will be up and running 
; will be disappointed by the news that, due to the heavy graphic 
; design work, we made no further progress on Monday.
; 
; The temperature rose from a very cold start of -4F -20C to a not 
; very balmy afternoon max of 19F -7C here at Fractal Central on 
; Monday.  The day began sunny, but by midday the clouds moved in, 
; with a forecast of light snow to come at night.  The fractal 
; cats were disappointed when the sun failed to reach their window 
; shelf before the clouds arrived, but they found comfort on the 
; shelf by the heat.
; 
; As reported above, my day was very busy.  FL's day was even 
; busier.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and try to keep your fractal politically correct.
