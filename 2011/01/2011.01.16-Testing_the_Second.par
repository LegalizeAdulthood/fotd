; FOTD -- January 17, 2011 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's quick fractal lies on the southwest shore line of the 
; main bud of the Z^(2.002)+C Mandeloid.  But it's not what would 
; be expected at this location.  The entire parent fractal has 
; been rotated so that the negative X-axis cuts through the bud at 
; this point, and things almost always get somewhat chaotic near 
; the X-axis of fractals with fractional exponents of Z.
; 
; The rating of a ? means that I was undecided on how to rate the 
; image.  On one hand, it's something never before seen; on the 
; other hand, it's just another picture of a minibrot with a fancy 
; basin around it.
; 
; The name "Testing the Second" is a re-arrangement of the first 
; title that came to mind -- "The Second Test".  There was a first 
; version of the same scene that failed miserably.  The whole 
; image is still little more than a test, which is another reason 
; why I could not decide on a rating.
; 
; The calculation time of 1/100 second under 2 minutes is fast 
; enough to keep boredom at bay, yet slow enough to allow time to 
; pour a drink in preparation for the grand revelation of the 
; never-before-seen image.
; 
; Those who would rather not run a parameter file may view the 
; full image in hi-def, rendered by Hal Lane and posted to the 
; current FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Paul's original FOTD web site is still at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; though it has not been updated in a while.
; 
; I think we'll begin uploading stuff to my own FOTD web site on 
; Monday, so be prepared for an upcoming announcement.
; 
; Except for a heavy but brief snow shower in the morning, Sunday 
; was a typical midwinter day here at Fractal Central, with ample 
; sun and a temperature of 34F +1C.  The fractal cats took full 
; advantage of the sun while it was shining, and fled to the 
; warmth of the shelf over the heat when the sun sank beneath the 
; top branches of a tree across the road.  The humans had an 
; active but not hectic day.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and sometimes the answer to a 
; perplexing problem is found where least expected.
