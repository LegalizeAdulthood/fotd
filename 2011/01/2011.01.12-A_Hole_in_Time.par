; FOTD -- January 13, 2011 (Rating 5.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As I forecast in yesterday's FOTD, today's image is a descent 
; into the inside of the debris-filled minibrot of yesterday's 
; image.  The scene is located near the center of the main bay, 
; just south of the centers of the concentric rings.
; 
; The name "A Hole in Time" is a fantasy.  I assumed that time is 
; the fourth dimension and today's image is a hole in its 
; ceaseless flow.  The rating of a 5-1/2 equals the amount of snow 
; (in inches) that fell overnight here at FC.  It also implies 
; that the image is not quite up to FOTD standards.
; 
; At first glance, the open areas in today's image appear as 
; though they would fill in with a higher maxiter.  This is not 
; so.  The points of the open areas are trapped forever.  I raised 
; the maxiter to 50,000 and found no change in the resulting 
; image.  (Actually there was a change.  The calculation time 
; more than tripled.)
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/3 minutes is a bit slow for such a 
; modestly rated image.  The way to avoid immodesty is to view the 
; finished image in its full glory on the currently active FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And don't forget the original site at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Snow fell through the night Tuesday here at Fractal Central, and 
; by daybreak Wednesday 5-1/2 inches 13cm were on the ground.  The 
; temperature rose from 23F -5C to 28F -2C by afternoon, as the 
; clouds hung on and a few snow flurries continued.  The fractal 
; cats watched alertly from their window shelf as I cleared the 
; pavement, then decided the shelf was too chilly and took to the 
; shelf by the heat.  The rest of the day was incident free.  The 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and search for the runaway fractal.
