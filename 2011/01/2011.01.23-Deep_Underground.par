; FOTD -- January 24, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's scene lies in a side filament of the period-7 bud on the 
; northwest shore line of the large minibrot on the main spike of 
; the Mandelbrot set.  It lies so deep that arbitrary precision 
; math is required to calculate it, which means the calculation 
; time is an inconveniently long 36 minutes.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is more a matter of taking credit for some-
; thing I did no work on than a reward for my brilliant effort.  I 
; spent most of the day lost in thought.  The fractint program did 
; 90-percent of the work.
; 
; The name "Deep Underground" refers mostly to the extreme depth 
; of the scene, and partly to the depth of my ponderings on Sunday.
; 
; The image may be seen by running the included parameter file and 
; waiting a half hour or so, or by surfing down to the current 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted.  But it may take a short 
; time for Hal to calculate and post it.
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; My own FOTD web site will soon be available on-line.  Keep 
; waiting for the announcement with bated but not abated breath.
; 
; Ample sun but a chilly temperature of 23F -5C kept the fractal 
; cats close to the heat here at Fractal Central on Sunday.  My 
; day was one of the slowest in quite a while.  It was so slow in 
; fact that laziness got the better of me, and FL had to ask if I 
; felt all right.  Luckily, when fractal time arrived, the M-set 
; once again came to the rescue with one of its infinite mini-
; brots.  But Monday will likely bring more work, so the peace 
; will not last.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and find the calmness that lies within.
