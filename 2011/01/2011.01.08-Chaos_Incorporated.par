; FOTD -- January 09, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As long as one does not look too deeply into the parent fractal 
; of today's image, it appears to be an everyday Mandelbrot set, 
; but in its depths a certain strangeness starts to creep in.  
; The surface minibrots are perfect miniature M-sets, but as we 
; go deeper, the minibrots become confused, as though they are 
; undecided whether to be quadratic or quintic miniatures.  Then, 
; when we reach the deepest depths, the minibrots are purely 
; quintic, with the four lobes and everything else expected in 
; such minibrots.
; 
; Normally, quintic minibrots are rather boring things, with a 
; tendency to all look the same, but the minibrot in today's 
; image is far from boring.  Minibrots usually lie at the center 
; of a basin, with the iteration count steadily increasing as the 
; minibrot is approached.  Some minibrots in fractals created with 
; certain formulas, such as the minibrot in today's image, are 
; like volcanoes however -- rising mountains with deep craters at 
; their peaks.  As we near these minibrots, the iteration count 
; first decreases gradually, then rises rapidly as we approach the 
; minibrot itself.  The reddish parts of today's image are the 
; lowest iteration stuff.  The sky-blue stuff behind the dark blue 
; blobs surrounding the flat circular red ridge, as well as the 
; stuff near the minibrot, is the actual high-iteration stuff.
; 
; The image is located in the trunk of the period-10 elephant on 
; the southeast shore line of the parent M-set.  It is quite close 
; to the limit of resolution, which makes the 'mathtolerance' 
; entry necessary in the included parameter file.  The name "Chaos 
; Incorporated" expresses my impression of the background areas 
; surrounding the red mountain.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 includes a half point for the coloring, 
; which is a not-insignificant part of the image.  (My modesty 
; prevents me from rewarding myself with more than a half-point 
; bonus.)
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/3 minutes is a fair price for such a 
; curious image.  The image may be seen for free on the currently 
; active FOTD web site at:

; 
; Lots of clouds filled the skies over Fractal Central on Satur-
; day, while the temperature hung around 27F -3C.  Light snow also 
; fell most all day, but by evening had amounted to no more than 
; 1cm.  The fractal cats complained about the lack of sun and then 
; found comfort on the shelf over the hall radiator.
; 
; My day was enjoyably slow.  We needed the rest after the hectic 
; days of the past few weeks.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and be in there with the big time 
; thinkers.  (I leave it to the individual to decide who the big 
; time thinkers are.)
