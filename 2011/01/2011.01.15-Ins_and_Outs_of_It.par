; FOTD -- January 16, 2011 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is an experimental one, which is why I gave it no 
; rating.  It came about as I was trying different color palettes 
; in search of a way to add the strongest 3-D effect to a fractal. 
; I decided to experiment with the FOTD image for this past Janu-
; ary 9 because it is filled with assorted hills and valleys.  The 
; Jan 9 image is named "Chaos Incorporated".  Today's image is a 
; small outzoom of that earlier image.
; 
; After trying several handmade color palettes with little suc-
; cess, I brought up the built-in ctrl(f1) palette.  A little 
; color tweaking gave me just about what I wanted.  In today's 
; image, the antiminibrot hills are bright at their centers, while 
; the normal minibrot valleys dark centers surrounded by lighter 
; circular ridges, making the difference quite easy to recognize.
; 
; Today's image is named "Ins and Outs of It".  The name refers to 
; the tiny hills and basins that fill the image.  The calculation 
; time of 2 minutes is blessedly brief, though I have no idea who 
; or what might be giving the blessing.
; 
; The image may be seen without the inconvenience of calculating 
; a parameter file by visiting the current FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; where Ken is doing a fine job while Paul is under the weather.
; 
; Paul's original web site is available at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; My own web site is in the advanced planning stage.  The delay is 
; due to a lack of time, always a problem here at FC, but the big 
; announcement is not too far off.
; 
; Lots of clouds, a morning low temperature of 19F -7C and an 
; afternoon high of 34F +2C made things rather unpleasant here at 
; Fractal Central on Saturday.  The fractal cats lost hope for sun 
; early in the afternoon, and spent their time by the heat.  The 
; day of the humans was uneventful, though rather busy.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be 
; lucky.
