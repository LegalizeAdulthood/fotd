; FOTD -- January 27, 2011 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With FL out of action, it was another hectic day for me here at 
; FC.  The double work load left no time to search through a new 
; parent fractal, so I returned to the immense minibrot basin of 
; the two most recent images, where I found today's image.
; 
; Today's image, with its magnitude of 2(10^87) is a back-out from 
; yesterday's googol-deep minibrot.  It actually lies about twice 
; as far from the central minibrot as the image of two days ago, 
; Jan 25, which lies in the same basin.  I named the image "Back-
; ing Out", for obvious reasons.
; 
; Since the image is the third consecutive one in the same mini-
; brot basin, I could not honestly rate it.  Actually however, 
; it's a rather pleasant image of slightly questionable character, 
; and well worth a look.
; 
; Since the scene is of a notably lesser magnitude, the calcula-
; tion time has been cut to a more reasonable 22 minutes, though 
; this is still quite slow by FOTD standards.  To speed up the 
; satisfaction, I suggest viewing the finished image on the active 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; But give Hal a bit of time to calculate and post it.
; 
; The old original FOTD web site may be found at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The last time I checked, it was not up to date, but that was 
; almost 2 weeks ago, and something might have happened since then.
; 
; Heavy clouds hung over Fractal Central all day Wednesday, with 
; snow flurries in the morning and steadier snow in the afternoon. 
; The temperature of exactly freezing kept the fractal cats con-
; fined to their warm shelf.
; 
; My day was quite busy.  With FL down with the bug, it was up to 
; me to do the work of the two of us and keep the hot chicken soup 
; handy.  Luckily, I knew the fractal was there before I ever saw 
; it.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and be thankful that fractals exist.
