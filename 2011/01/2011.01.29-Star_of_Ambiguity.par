; FOTD -- January 30, 2011 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yesterday's scene was located in a side filament of the north-
; eastern period-10 bud on the main bay of the Mandelbrot set.  
; Today's image is a close up of the 'star' on the main filament 
; extending from that same bud.  The color palette is a virtual 
; repeat of yesterday's, with only a few minor changes.
; 
; Once again, I rendered the scene with the outside set to 'tdis'. 
; At this low magnitude the slow-down is still apparent, but with 
; a calculation time of a mere 40 seconds, the delay is no problem.
; 
; The rating of a 6-1/2 indicates that the image is worth at least 
; a brief look, especially with a calculation time of 40 seconds.
; 
; The name "Star of Ambiguity" implies that no one knows exactly 
; what lies at the center of the 'star' in the image.  Actually, 
; the star has no limit, so all attempts to find what lies at its 
; center are certain to be futile.  The center always lies just 
; beyond the limit of definition.
; 
; With all the new-fangled programs inserting strange characters 
; into text files, running parameter files from the internet can 
; sometimes be tricky.  The simplest way to avoid the problems 
; caused by strange characters is to view the image already calcu-
; lated on the currently active FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original web site, currently inactive, may be accessed at:

; 
; Steady snow fell all day Saturday here at Fractal Central, while 
; the temperature hovered around a reasonable 28F -2C.  By night-
; fall about 3-1/2 inches or 9cm of fresh snow had piled up.  As I 
; cleared the fractal driveway, the fractal cats watched the 
; action from their window shelf.  They took to their warmer shelf 
; over the heat when the outside show ended.
; 
; My day was busy, mostly with keeping the fractal pavements 
; cleaned and keeping the chicken soup coming for FL, who is back 
; on her feet, but still not up to par.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if the theory of 
; relativity is correct, one plus one does not always equal two.
