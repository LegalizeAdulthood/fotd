; FOTD -- January 19, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the same spread-out, wedge-shaped valley 
; as yesterday's image, and it shows much the same kind of 
; features.  But while yesterday's image was located on the south 
; side of the valley, today's image lies on the north side.
; 
; A good part of today's image consists of 'inside' areas brought 
; to life by the inside=zmag option.  The inside stuff is so 
; arranged that it's rather hard to tell where the outside ends 
; and the inside begins.
; 
; The rating of a 7 reflects my opinion of the basic worth of the 
; image.  I did put some effort into the coloring, but not enough 
; earn a reward of a half-point coloring bonus.
; 
; The name "Seeing Triple" refers to the cubic nature of the 
; poorly-defined minibrot at the center.  (The image should have 
; a higher maxiter.)  When I thought of the name, I was wondering 
; how many eyes a four-dimensional being would need for 4-dimen-
; sional vision in his 4-D space.  I decided on three eyes, but 
; two might be sufficient.  Regardless, the name refers to the 
; minibrot, not a hypothetical hyperbeing.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/3 minutes is about average for a 
; fractal.  Time may be saved by viewing the finished image on the 
; current FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; is still waiting for Paul to recover.
; 
; The snow and ice on Tuesday prevented any further work on the 
; upcoming FOTD web site.
; 
; Two inches, 5cm, of snow fell overnight Monday here at Fractal 
; Central.  The snow changed to freezing rain Tuesday morning, 
; leaving a crunchy coating on the snow before ending by noon.
; 
; The temperature finally rose one degree C above freezing in the 
; afternoon, making the job of clearing the fractal sidewalk much 
; easier.  The fractal cats watched the outdoor action with much 
; interest, but took frequent breaks on their shelf over the hall 
; heater to keep warm.
; 
; My day was occupied by moving snow and ice, while FL kept the 
; commercial work moving and the coffee hot.  The next FOTD will 
; be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and when the 
; going gets tough, the tough look for help.
