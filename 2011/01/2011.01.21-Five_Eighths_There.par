; FOTD -- January 22, 2001 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us back once again to the parent almost-
; Mandelbrot set fractal of the Jan. 8 FOTD image.  This time I 
; checked the trunk of the period-46 elephant on the southern side 
; of the valley.  Only a slight distance into the trunk I found a 
; quadratic minibrot caught morphing into a quintic minibrot.  
; Today's scene lies in a chunk of left-over quadratic stuff 
; inside the main bay of this minibrot.
; 
; The much smaller minibrot at the center of today's image lies 
; just beyond the limit of resolution, but it is a purely quintic 
; one.  The outer elements surrounding the minibrot are quadratic 
; stuff however, which leads to a diamond-shaped area of confusion 
; where one type of stuff changes to another.
; 
; The rating of a 7 indicates that the image is a cut above aver-
; age.  The name "Five-Eighths There" came about when I noticed 
; the normal 2,4,8,16... quadratic series going through the area 
; of confusion before changing into the unlikely quintic series of 
; 5,25,125,625...  The name doesn't make much sense, but a name is 
; a name, and this will be the name of today's image.
; 
; The calculation time of 5 minutes is a bit of a burden.  The 
; burden may be lifted however by surfing down to the current FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original web site at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; is still worth a look.
; 
; Due to the rush here at FC on Friday, my own FOTD web site made 
; no progress.  There is no time limit however, and before long 
; the site will be up and running.
; 
; About 3-1/2 inches (9cm) of snow fell overnight Thursday here 
; at Fractal Central, which meant a Friday morning of sidewalk 
; clearing.  The fractal cats gave moral support by watching from 
; the window, while FL kept the coffee hot and the work moving.  
; Friday afternoon was partly cloudy, with snow flurries, brisk 
; winds and steadily falling temperatures, which reached 19F -7C 
; by sunset, with a forecast low of +7F -14C.
; 
; The rest of the humans' day was again quite busy, which seems to 
; be more the rule than the exception these days.  Maybe it's a 
; sign of the improving economy.  The next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take the usual care, and when someone 
; wonders about the meaning of life, tell them the question is 
; meaningless and see if they consider the answer satisfactory.
