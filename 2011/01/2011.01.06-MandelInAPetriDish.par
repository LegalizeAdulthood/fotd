; 
; FOTD -- January 07, 2011 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates a 6.5.  I was torn between a rating of a 6 
; and a 7, and the best way to settle the dilemma was to give the 
; image a rating of 6-1/2.  But unlike most fractional ratings, 
; today's includes no bonus for the coloring, which was achieved 
; almost entirely by the Fractint program.
; 
; When I saw the image, it brought back memories of bacterial 
; cultures in the old biology classes.  The name "Mandel in a 
; Petri Dish" seems quite appropriate.
; 
; The image combines features of the Z^2 and Z^4 Mandeloids, 
; though at the depth of the image the Z^4 features predominate.  
; The central minibrot is filled with concentric rings of alterna-
; ting chaos and order; the chaotic areas are filled with smaller 
; minibrots as well as 'antiminibrots' with peaks instead of 
; valleys at their centers.
; 
; Perhaps the best feature of the image is its relatively speedy 
; calculation time of just over 2 minutes, which is about the time 
; it will take to surf down to the currently active FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted.
; 
; The original web site at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; is still available, and always worth a quick check.
; 
; While watching the TV news during the Thursday lunch break, I 
; saw a report of several localized showers of falling birds.  No 
; one knows the actual cause, but it appears the flocks of birds 
; became disoriented and flew into things.  The question of what 
; caused the birds to lose their bearings remains unanswered, but 
; in my opinion, the cause could have been the electromagnetic 
; haze created by the current proliferation of wireless devices 
; and the necessary cell towers to support them.
; 
; It is known that some birds navigate by sensing earth's magnetic 
; field.  Perhaps the electromagnetic signals emitted by the ever-
; increasing number of cell towers is interfering with the birds' 
; ability to orient themselves.  If this is true however, it is 
; unlikely the news media, which is controlled by the giant commun-
; ication corporations, would cover such a story.  I also wonder 
; whether the 'greenie' activists who claim to care so much about 
; the environment would be willing to give up their wireless 
; devices to save the birds.
; 
; A final thought -- maybe the birds are like canaries in a coal 
; mine.  Maybe we should consider their deaths a warning.  Yeah, 
; yeah, I know the old mantra -- there is no solid evidence that 
; wireless radiation is harmful.  But the hints of danger are 
; everywhere.  What I want to see is solid evidence that it is 
; safe.
; 
; A mix of sun and clouds and a high temperature of freezing made 
; Thursday another typical winter day here at Fractal Central.  
; The fractal cats grew bored with the on-and-off sun and settled 
; for the afternoon in the warmest places they could find.
; 
; With the work up to date, my day was fair enough.  And the plans 
; for the FOTD web site here at FC are coming along.  Expect an 
; announcement in a couple weeks.  The next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours, more or less.  Until then, take care, and watch for 
; scattered showers of falling birds.
