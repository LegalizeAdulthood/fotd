; FOTD -- February 05, 2011 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a dip into one of the axes of the Mandelbrot 
; set.  We've had a lot of these axis-dips lately, but as far as I 
; know, almost all of these dips have been into the X-axis.  The 
; reason is that the X-axis is a well-defined line of symmetry, 
; while the Y-axis, the axis of today's dip, is a vague thing, 
; with nothing to point it out amid its chaotic surroundings.
; 
; The minibrots along the X-axis have an orderly arrangement that 
; makes them quite interesting and artistically rewarding.  Mini-
; brots along the Y-axis do not exist.  The Y-axis does pass 
; through some (an infinity) of minibrots, but it does so by acci-
; dent, and the minibrots can lie in any orientation.
; 
; Today's minibrot lies not exactly on the Y-axis, merely very 
; close to it, which explains the name "On What Y-Axis?"  I could 
; have found a minibrot that is actually intersected by the 
; Y-axis, but I ran out of patience when, what I hope was one 
; final fit of coughing erupted and put me in a cranky mood.  If 
; I had found a minibrot that actually intersected the Y-axis 
; however, it would have looked almost like today's.
; 
; The rating of a 5 is an admission that I could have done better.
; 
; The calculation time of exactly 6 seconds will pass like an 
; evening in June (in the Northern Hemisphere).  The trip to the 
; currently active FOTD web site at:
; 
;  <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; will take a somewhat longer time, but it will totally eliminate 
; the small task of running the included parameter file.
; 
; Meanwhile, keep in mind the original FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; I'm not sure what will eventually become of the original site, 
; but it still holds all the images and discussions prior to 
; November 2010.
; 
; The cloudy sky in the south gave stark contrast to the clear 
; blue sky in the north here at Fractal Central on Friday, with 
; the dividing line directly overhead.  The temperature rose from 
; a daybreak low of 9F -13C to an afternoon high of 30F -1C.  Un-
; fortunately, the clouds in the south blocked most of the sun, 
; driving the fractal cats to their shelf by the heat.  They 
; leaped down only to help finish the latest bowl of chicken soup. 
; The forecast is for more snow and ice on Saturday.
; 
; The rest of the day was spent getting the routine work caught 
; up and pondering a philosophical question raised by FL -- what 
; is wrong with people in the world?  The next FOTD will be posted 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and look alive even if 
; you're not.
