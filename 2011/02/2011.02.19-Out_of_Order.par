; FOTD -- February 20, 2011 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; An antiquing expedition did happen on Saturday, and it left very 
; little time for a proper fractal search.  However, I did manage 
; to find an acceptable image, (rated a 5), in the parent fractal 
; that results when the formula Z^(1.99)+C is iterated just one 
; level up the complex logarithmic hyper-spiral and no function is 
; applied.
; 
; On its surface, this parent appears to be a normal everyday 
; Mandelbrot set that has been rotated so that its main spike 
; faces northeast instead of west.  But problems arise on the 
; negative X-axis, which in today's parent cuts through what is 
; normally the southeast shore line of the main bay.  Today's 
; image lies in the mess of discontinuities in this small area.  
; As would be expected, the image consists mostly of discontinui-
; ties.
; 
; The name "Out of Order" refers to the fact that it is not normal 
; for the negative X-axis to cut through the southeast shore line 
; of the main bay of the M-set.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/2 minutes may be cut to 2-1/2 
; minutes by resetting the passes to 'g', but doing so will cause 
; some of the finer detail to be missed.
; 
; Both speed and accuracy may be achieved by viewing the finished 
; image on the current FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original web site with all the past FOTD images may be 
; accessed at:

; 
; Lots of clouds, a strong northwest wind and a steadily falling 
; temperature made Saturday anything but enjoyable here at Fractal 
; Central.  When the temperature dropped below freezing late in 
; the afternoon, the fractal cats took to their shelf over the 
; heat, where they enjoyed a comfortable evening.
; 
; FL and I spent most of the day on an antiquing expedition.  With 
; the work just about caught up, the rest of the day was unevent-
; ful.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and be satisfied with less than everything.
