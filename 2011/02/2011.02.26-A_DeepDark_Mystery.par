; FOTD -- February 26, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; This FOTD will be coming through an indirect route.  But I think 
; the problem with the blocked e-mail direct to the Fractint list 
; has been solved.  Earthlink says it will take several days for 
; me to regain access to xmission however, so I am still not 
; claiming that the problem has ended.
; 
; Today's rather striking image lies in the parent fractal that 
; results when the simple formula Z^(1.5)+C is iterated 3 levels 
; up the logarithmic ladder and no function is applied.  This 
; parent consists of a reasonably recognizable main bay with a 
; disconnected fragment of a filament lying some distance to the 
; southwest.  Today's scene lies near a larger minibrot on this 
; fragment.
; 
; Most of the 'striking' effect is due to my coloring, which 
; explains the extra half point I awarded to myself.  The rather 
; suggestive name 'A Deep Dark Mystery' refers to the location of 
; the scene in its parent fractal.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes is almost blazingly fast, 
; especially considering that the image is not a type=mandel, 
; which I think uses machine language.
; 
; Those who would rather not calculate may view the finished image 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
;

; 
; Morning rain and afternoon wind marked Friday here at Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cats didn't mind the rain, but they got a 
; bit skittish when trash cans started blowing around in the after-
; noon.  The temperature of 37F +3C was near normal for the day; 
; the wind made it feel much colder however.  The next FOTD is 
; schedule to be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; beware of fraudulent fractals.
