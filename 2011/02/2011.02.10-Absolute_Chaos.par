; FOTD -- February 11, 2011 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image came on strong.  When I first saw the area of the 
; parent fractal, I thought I was really into something interest-
; ing.  And sure enough, I soon found a minibrot.  But for some 
; reason, I simply could not find a color palette able to bring 
; out the hidden worth that I feel lay within the image.  So here 
; is today's image, worth only a pathetic lowly 3.
; 
; Normally, I would not even consider posting such a scene, or I 
; would let it go with no rating, but today I wanted to emphasize 
; that, at least in my opinion, the image is an abject failure.  
; My alibi is a lack of time.  If I had had more free time to work 
; with the colors, I might have found a better color palette.
; 
; On the technical side, the image is an 'evaporated' one, which 
; means it consists totally of 'inside' stuff made visible by the 
; 'bof61' inside fill.  The parent fractal certainly holds far 
; better images, and in the next FOTD, with more time to search, 
; I'll hopefully present one of them.
; 
; But for today, the way to escape the excessive 12-minute calcula-
; tion time is to view the finished image on the active FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; the original but currently inactive FOTD web site may be 
; accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; There was no FOTD on Wednesday because I spent the day back at 
; Old Fractal Central searching for the cause of a growing water 
; stain down one of the walls.  It took about 15 minutes to trace 
; the cause to a hole at the edge of the roof that probably resul-
; ted when recent heavy snow pulled down the rain gutter along 
; with part of the roof.  The hole is letting water drain down 
; inside the wall.
; 
; I also noticed that a squirrel has taken up residence in the 
; attic, using the hole as its doorway.  I made a very temporary 
; repair.  A professional job is needed however, and the squirrel 
; will have to be evicted.
; 
; The sun was bright here at Fractal Central on Thursday, but the 
; morning temperature of 10F -12C set a very chilly tone to the 
; entire day.  The fractal cats approved of the sun and spent the 
; afternoon sharing the warmth of the sunny shelf in the southwest 
; window.
; 
; My day was fully occupied with getting the work caught up.  The 
; next FOTD is due to be posted in 24 hours.  In all likelihood, 
; it will appear as scheduled.  Until next time, take care, and 
; may the force be with those in the right.  (I leave it to the 
; individual to decide who or what is in the right.)
