; FOTD -- February 15, 2011 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we bid farewell to the parent fractal of the 
; past four days and turn to the fractal that results when the 
; formula Z^(1.88)+C is iterated 12 levels up the complex logarith-
; mic hyper-ladder.  This parent fractal is a multi-part one, a 
; single large Mandeloid surrounded by smaller Mandeloids, with 
; today's image located in a curling filament extending from one of 
; these smaller Mandeloids.
; 
; After due consideration, I rated today's image at a 6, which 
; lately has pretty much been the average.  The name "Voice of 
; Authority" sounds like it means something important.  Actually, 
; like a piece of modern art, it means nothing at all.  The image 
; itself is a typical fractured thing that results when fractional 
; powers of Z are iterated.  I put a little extra effort into the 
; coloring to bring out the reds and oranges as well as the smooth 
; beige interior, though I'm not sure what good it did.
; 
; The calculation time of 6-1/3 minutes is too slow to be a 
; bargain.  I recommend viewing the finished image on the current 
; FOTD web site at:

; 
; The current issue of a leading 'news' magazine has a cover story 
; about a so-called 'singularity' due to arrive in 2045, when the 
; machines man has created will become more intelligent than their 
; creators.  According to the technologists, we will then have the 
; ability to transfer our unique stream of awareness into machine 
; bodies, becoming immortal androids.  Of course, those unfortu-
; nate people who don't live that long or who lack the money to 
; pay for the process will be left behind in the dust bin of 
; history.
; 
; It's a nice fantasy, but for some reason it strikes me as wish-
; ful thinking.  Maybe I'm missing something, but as far as I 
; know, not a single one of these future predictions has yet come 
; true as predicted.   As for the current prediction, no one has 
; determined exactly what is the 'stream of awareness' that makes 
; each of us our individual unchanging selves.  What is it that we 
; would transfer into the machine bodies?  What stays the same 
; while the material of the body and the patterns in the brain 
; constantly change?  Oh well, all I can say is, 'have a happy 
; dream'.
; 
; Monday dawned clear and mild here at Fractal Central, and by 
; midday the temperature had risen to 54F 12C.  But shortly after 
; noon heavy clouds moved in and by sunset the temperature was 
; again down near freezing.  The fractal cats made the most of 
; the off-and-on sunshine.
; 
; The rest of the day was uneventful.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if your full 
; faith lies with science and technology, make the down payment 
; today on your new android body.  (Do people actually believe 
; this stuff?)
