; FOTD -- February 09, 2011 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image we get down to the nitty-gritty, which is what 
; I named it.  This is a picture of a miniature Mandeloid caught 
; in the process of trying to morph itself into a well-defined 
; baby Mandelbrot set.  But with an exponent of `Z' of only 1.913, 
; the little fellow lacks the material he needs to pull himself 
; into perfect shape.  The intent and effort are there; only the 
; material is lacking.
; 
; I gave the minibrot a somber gray background to show that regard-
; less of how hard he tries, he will never reach full mandelhood.  
; But look at the richness he has created in his surroundings in 
; his futile struggles to achieve perfection.  His efforts alone 
; certainly rate the 6-1/2.
; 
; In addition to the lack of a solid `2' for an exponent, the mini-
; brot at the center of today's image also suffers from a lack of 
; a sufficient maxiter.  The rather anemic maxiter of 1750 should 
; be at least doubled if we want to see all the central minibrot 
; has to offer.
; 
; The calculation time of a little over 2 minutes will pass in 
; less than half a flash.  Only then will it be known whether the 
; result was worth the effort.  To keep risk of disappointment at 
; a minimum, I recommend viewing the finished image on the active 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
;

; 
; Tuesday brought lots of sun to Fractal Central, but it also 
; brought biting winds and a temperature of 25F -4C.  The fractal 
; cats concerned themselves only with the sun, which despite the 
; outside chill, was strong enough to keep them on their shelf in 
; the window most of the afternoon.  My day was busy and thankful-
; ly free of politics.  The next FOTD is due in 24 hours, though I 
; hear we have a problem back at Old Fractal Central, and I may 
; need to go there on Wednesday to check things out.  Until when-
; ever, take care, and be satisfied with what you've got.
