; FOTD -- February 07, 2011 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent of today's image is kind of a distorted Mandelbrot 
; set rotated so that its west side faces south.  It came into 
; existence when I calculated the formula Z^(1.81712)+C at level 
; 10 of the hyperladder.  (1.81712 is the cube root of 6, though 
; this has no significance in the appearance of the image.)
; 
; The parent fractal has a very large object just north of the 
; main bay.  This cut-off object is too large to be called a 
; minibrot, so I consider it a sub-parent.  Today's scene lies in 
; a valley of this sub-parent, regardless of what one calls it.
; 
; I gave the image no rating, since I kind of ran out of fractal 
; steam and drifted into philosophy-land before the image reached 
; its full potential.  The name "In the Wilderness" describes my 
; mental state while thinking of the name more than the image 
; itself.
; 
; The calculation time of over 8 minutes may be reduced signifi-
; cantly by resetting the passes to 'g', but doing so will cause 
; much of the random decoration to be missed.
; 
; The calculation may be eliminated totally by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;  <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original web site may be accessed at:

; 
; We were caught nearly by surprise here at Fractal Central on 
; Sunday, when the weather turned almost pleasant, with a 
; temperature of 41F +5C and lots of sun. The sun enabled me to 
; easily clear the remaining ice from the fractal driveway, and 
; also gave the fractal cats a very enjoyable afternoon on their 
; shelf in the window, from where they watched me at work.  FL 
; added moral support and hot refreshment.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and we appear to live in a universe of three dimensions 
; because this number of mental spatial dimensions is what the 
; human consciousness creates for a field of 'outer' activity.  
; Theoretical super-advanced aliens probably create a higher-
; dimensional mental space for their 'outer' activities.  (In all 
; cases the math is contrived to work with what is observed.)
