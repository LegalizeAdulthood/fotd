; FOTD -- March 08, 2011 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things turned quite busy here at FC on Monday, with lots of snow 
; to clear away and plenty of other work to clear up also.  When 
; things turned too hectic, I decided I needed a break from the 
; routine of getting the early FOTD images and parameter files 
; ready to be posted to my FOTD web site, which involves boring 
; and repetitious things such as taking out the carriage returns 
; in the discussions.  (Recoloring the old images is a lot more 
; fun.)  Unless we get flooded or something else happens, the web 
; site should appear late this week.
; 
; What better way to take a break than to find an all-new fractal? 
; I named it "Taking a Break" because that's what I was doing when 
; I found it.  It's not much of an image, rating only only a hum-
; drum 5, but it's all new, and that's what counts.
; 
; The image lies near a larger minibrot in the 'fan' of the frac-
; tal that results when 4 negative parts of Z^(-1.3) are combined 
; with 0.8 negative part of Z^(-5.3) and (1/C) is added on each 
; iteration.
; 
; The calculation time of only 36 seconds is blessedly brief.  
; Another way to see the image is to visit Hal's FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted.
; 
; Paul's web site is still located at:
; 
;      <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; but it is far from up to date.
; 
; Rain fell all day Sunday here at Fractal Central.  At nightfall 
; it changed to heavy snow, which fell all night.  Monday dawned 
; with a clearing sky and 13 inches, (32cm) of fresh snow on the 
; ground, with drifts over one meter high.  Luckily, the rest of 
; Monday turned quite mild.  The temperature of 43F +6C and strong 
; sun did away with much of the snow.  The fractal cats were puz-
; zled by the changed appearance of the outside world, but fully 
; enjoyed the sun on their window shelf.
; 
; My day was hectic; FL's was pretty much the same.  The next new 
; FOTD will be posted whenever I again need a break from setting 
; up the web site.  I will continue to post the old FOYD's every 
; couple days while working on the site.  Until whenever, take 
; care, and if science is wrong, then what is right?
