; FOTD -- March 14, 2011 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things have been very wet here at Fractal Central these past 
; few days, wet enough in fact to flood the FC basement 10cm deep. 
; But by Sunday the water had subsided, and things were getting 
; back to normal.
; 
; In the fractal department, I have returned to an old formula for 
; today's image -- the Mystic2 formula, which is at least 12 years 
; old.  When the inside is set to a flat color, this formula draws 
; nothing but empty circles, but when an active coloring such as 
; the 'bof61 is applied to the inside, strange things begin happen-
; ing.  Today's image shows some of these strange things.
; 
; The image consists entirely of inside stuff made visible by the 
; 'bof61' inside fill.  It is very sensitive to changes in the 
; inside fill, the function and the p3 parameter.  The p1 and p2 
; parameters have a far lesser effect.
; 
; The name "Shadow Dance" sounds kind of Native Americanish, but 
; it has little to do with the appearance of the image.
; 
; Due to the lack of organized colors, I could rate it no higher 
; than a 6.
; 
; The finished image soon will be available on the current FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be found at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; My own FOTD web site will soon be up and running, though due to 
; problems dealing with the flooded basement, it has made no 
; progress since the last report.
; 
; Sunday brought clouds and a temperature of 43F +6C to Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cats took it all in stride.  They were 
; more interested in being fed.  My day was spent recuperating 
; from the flooded basement and watching far greater disasters on 
; TV.  The next FOTD will be posted in a couple days.  Until then, 
; take care, and no matter how bad things seem, they are never so 
; bad that they could not get worse.
