; FOTD -- March 31, 2011 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; NOTICE!  Do not try to recreate today's image from the included 
; parameter file, which contains only the 3-D transform informa-
; tion.  To view the image, you must go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; where Hal has posted it.
; 
; Today's image is named "Little Lost Orphan" because it has lost 
; its parent fractal.  It is an image from years ago, when I 
; briefly experimented with making 3-D transforms of type=plasma 
; images.  Such transforms can make rather convincing landscapes, 
; but for some reason I quickly grew bored with the icy images.  A 
; few rather impressive scenes showed up before I turned to the 
; 4-D Julibrot stuff however.
; 
; The type=plasma image to which the transform was originally 
; applied was long ago discarded, but today's parameter file may 
; be applied to any other type=plasma image (or any Fractint image 
; at all) to create different landscapes, so feel free to create 
; as many scenes as your adventurous heart desires.  (The process 
; is a bit convoluted, so I recommend reading the 3-D transform 
; instructions.)
; 
; I have no idea how today's image might compare with what might 
; be possible using the 3-D transform feature on type=plasma 
; images, so I could give the image no rating.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/3 minutes is the time it took for 
; the original transform to calculate on the old 80486-100mhz 
; machine.  On modern units, the image would finish in a matter of 
; seconds.
; 
; A bit of good news is that the start of my own FOTD web site has 
; been uploaded and needs only a bit of link-tweaking before being 
; made public.
; 
; In view of all this excitement, do not forget the original web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Tuesday brought lots of sun and a temperature of 50F 10C to 
; Fractal Central.  Wednesday brought heavy clouds and similar 
; temperatures.  The fractal cats enjoyed the sun on Tuesday and 
; complained about the lack of it on Wednesday.
; 
; My day, as well as FL's day, was quite busy both Tuesday and 
; Wednesday.  Things that do not work right keep popping up on the 
; web site.  But the goal is in sight, so all that patience will 
; soon be rewarded.  The next FOTD will be posted in 48 hours or 
; so.  Until then, take care, and I have lots of answers but I've 
; lost the questions.
