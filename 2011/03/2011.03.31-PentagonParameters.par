; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- April 01, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The soon-to-appear FOTD web site is making great progress.  With 
; today's image, I will try to return to the usual every-day 
; schedule of FOTD's.  I make no promises however -- not in this 
; world where the unexpected can always go wrong.
; 
; Normally, not much can be done with quintic minibrots.  They 
; tend to all look the same.  But when calculated with the 
; FinDivBrot-2 formula, the quintics can really come to life.  
; Today's scene shows one of these quintic minibrots doing a good 
; deal more than would be expected from it.
; 
; The parent fractal is a corrupt Mandelbrot set, well on the way 
; to becoming an order-5 Mandeloid.  Today's scene is located in a 
; tiny spurious valley on the negative X-axis.
; 
; The name "Pentagon Parameters" is little more than a play on 
; words.  The rating of a 7 might be a little excessive, but so 
; what?  Tomorrow, I might decide the image is worth only a 5.
; 
; The image may be seen and appreciated by running the included 
; parameter file.  The running time of a mere 30 seconds will make 
; the task a minor one.
; 
; The image may be accessed without the need for calculation at 
; the currently active web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may still be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The address of my own web site will be announced in a matter of 
; a day or two.
; 
; Thursday proved to be very unpleasant here at Fractal Central.  
; Heavy clouds filled the sky, while the temperature hovered 
; around 39F +4C and a misty drizzle fell most all day.  The 
; forecast is for several inches of wet sloppy snow overnight and 
; on Friday.  The fractal cats were unconcerned with outside 
; conditions, and spent the day wishing they could have the excite-
; ment the old fractal cats had when they spent their days back at 
; Old FC, exploring the holly hollow at the bottom of the yard.  
; (Actually, the two pairs of fractal cats never met.)
; 
; The day of the humans on Thursday was once again busy, mostly 
; with ironing out the pesky problems that keep arising on the 
; new FOTD web site.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, or 
; maybe 48 hours if unexpected problems arise.  Until next time, 
; take care, and if two people dream they are observing the Statue 
; of Liberty, is it the same statue image they are experiencing?
