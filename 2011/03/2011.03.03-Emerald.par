; FOYD -- March 04, 2011
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's blast from the past is from way back -- May 06, 1997.  
; But the image we see today is far different than the old one I 
; posted almost 14 years ago.  I have reworked it to bring out the 
; effect of translucency at the edges.
; 
; The formula behind the action is the MandNewt10, one in a series 
; of formulas that I wrote many years ago and have since almost 
; forgotten about.  I never did figure out exactly what they do.
; 
; I have dropped the rating system for the FOYD's.  It's hard to 
; give proper ratings to images that are mere tweakings of earlier 
; scenes.
; 
; The name "Emerald" is obviously based on the color scheme.
; 
; The calculation time of all these old images is quite brief.  
; After all, when I began the FOTD I was using a 100mhz-80486 
; machine.
; 
; To see the image without the need for calculation, check Hal's 
; web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Paul's site still has the old version of the image posted.
; 
; My own FOTD web site is moving along.  The design is pretty well 
; worked out.  In fact, the first month is almost ready.  We will 
; upload it in a couple days and see how it flies.  I'll post the 
; address as soon as the first month is online and we see that 
; it's working.  If nothing goes wrong, there will be only 166+ 
; more months to get posted!
; 
; Thursday was quite chilly but sunny here at Fractal Central.  
; The temperature rose from a morning low of 14F -10C to an after-
; noon high of only freezing.  The fractal cats fully enjoyed the 
; warm sun, but they would have preferred a bit less draft from 
; the window.  The next FOYD will be posted in a couple days.  
; Until next time, take care, and I hear that the world is due to 
; end on May 21.
