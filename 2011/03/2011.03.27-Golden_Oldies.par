; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- March 27, 2011 (*6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I realize that three days have passed since the I posted the 
; last FOTD, but we have been quite busy on regular work and the 
; upcoming FOTD web site here at FC these past few days.
; 
; Today's image is a blast from the past, from around the time of 
; the start of the FOTD in fact, though it never quite made FOTD 
; status.  The image is one of those indescribable things created 
; by the MandNewt formulas -- formula number 12 to be exact.  It 
; is typical of the easy (by today's standards) stuff I was doing 
; at that time, when my machine was a 100mhz 80486.
; 
; The name "Golden Oldies" looks back with nostalgia on those days 
; of yore.  But since the image is not a new one, I had to add an 
; asterisk to its rating of a 6.  The calculation time of 1-1/2 
; minutes on the 2000mhz unit would have been closer to 1/2 hour 
; on the original machine.
; 
; The easiest way to view the finished image is to hop down to the 
; current FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and view it, finished, there.
; 
; The old original FOTD site is available at:
; 
; <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; My own web site is nearing readiness, but not quite ready.  I'll 
; post the address as soon as I feel it is ready.
; 
; Saturday was sunny but unusually cold here at Fractal Central.  
; The temperature rose from 19F -7C at daybreak to an afternoon 
; high of a meager 37F +3C.  The fractal cats chose the sun.  The 
; next FOTD will be posted as soon as I get a chance.  Until then, 
; take care, and did anyone lose their mind?  I saw one lurking 
; under the porch stairs this morning.
