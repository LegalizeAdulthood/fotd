; FOTD -- March 24, 2011 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Do not be alarmed when you run today's parameter file and the 
; screen stays blank for a couple minutes.  Due to the passes=t 
; and the lack of detail at the edge of the frame, the image is 
; a slow one to get started, but things pick up once the calcula-
; tion reaches the actual central crescent.
; 
; Today's FOTD is an image of the entire Mandelbrot set.  Well, 
; the entire set is in there somewhere, but it has been so 
; distorted by the 'invert' feature of Fractint that it has been 
; reduced to a horse shoe crescent.
; 
; The center of the scene lies somewhere in the Seahorse Valley 
; area of the large minibrot on the main stem of the M-set, though 
; one would never guess it from what appears on the screen.
; 
; The name "Where in the World" refers to the difficulty of deter-
; mining exactly where in the M-set today's scene is located.
; 
; Since I believe this is the first time I have used Fractint's 
; 'invert' feature in an FOTD, I have almost no idea of what is 
; possible with this option, so I could give today's image no 
; rating.
; 
; The rather slow calculation time of 11 minutes is mostly due to 
; the very large maxiter of 2,500,000.  This slowness may be 
; avoided however by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:

; 
; Wednesday began with slushy snow here at Fractal Central.  By 
; midday the snow changed to rain, which made the slush even 
; slushier.  To end the day with a grand finale, a thunder-shower 
; passed over at 6pm.  The temperature held steady around 34F +1C 
; most of the day.  The fractal cats took a few glances at the 
; unpleasant outside conditions, but spent most of the time close 
; to the heat.
; 
; In the human department, our day was busy, yet under control.  
; I'll try to post the next FOTD in 48 hours, but since the future 
; is unpredictable, there are no promises.  Until whenever, take 
; care, and take a moment to wonder why there is a vast universe 
; instead of simply nothing.
