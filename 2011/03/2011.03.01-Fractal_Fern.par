; FOYD -- March 02, 2011 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Well, what do we have here?  It's not an FOTD, it's an FOYD.
; This is not a typo, its a new breed of animal.  I am now posting
; FOYD's -- Fractals of YesterDay.  As I recently mentioned, I am
; reworking some of the old images to give my upcoming web site
; something out of the ordinary.
; 
; Today's image is a 14-year-old one first posted in April, 1997
; under the name Fractal Fern.  A comparison of that old image
; with the improved version that I am posting in this FOYD makes
; it very clear that some of the old FOTD images have a lot of
; room for improvement.
; 
; Since the work on the web site will leave little time to find
; new images, I will post some of the old ones that have been sig-
; nificantly improved by a second effort.  But I cannot honestly
; call the old images 'Fractals of the Day', so I have decided to
; call them 'Fractals of YesterDay'.
; 
; The latest news about the soon-coming web site is that FL has
; agreed to help me get it up and running when she has the time.
; In return I will include on my site a link to her pet project --
; a word-search-puzzle site -- and she will do the same on her
; site.  Fair is fair.
; 
; My present plans are to post simple 640x480 images, along with
; the discussions and parameter files.  But the images will not be
; mere duplicates of those on the old web site.  The images on my
; site will be reworked to bring them up to my present standards.
; When I get the site up to date I will resume posting new FOTD
; images, perhaps in high definition, but this will be some
; distance in the future.
; 
; Finally, I must state that things are still at a rudimentary
; stage.  Most likely plans will change as we find out what will
; work and what will not.
; 
; The weather here at Fractal Central on Tuesday was near perfect
; -- total sun and a temperature of 43F +6C.  The fractal cats
; were quite frisky for some reason, and at one time I thought I
; heard them quarreling.  My day and FL's day as well were quite
; busy, mostly working out web site problems.
; 
; The next FOYD will be posted in a day or two, whenever I make
; enough improvement in some old image to make it worth posting at
; once.  Until then, take care, and keep the fractal faith.
