; FOTD -- August 06, 2011 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a dive into the FOTD image of August 2, which 
; explains the name "Revisited Venue".  Considering the wealth of 
; detail and the effort I put into the coloring, the rating of 9 
; is fully justified despite the revisit, at least in my own 
; opinion.
; 
; My first impression of the image was surprise that a simple 
; minibrot on a filament could be surrounded by such detail.  But 
; maybe it should not be so surprising, considering the magnitude 
; of almost 10^25, a magnitude at which the entire Mandelbrot set 
; rivals the size of the visible universe.  (The present estimates 
; are that the visible universe is about 27,000,000,000 light 
; years in diameter.)
; 
; Unfortunately, with great magnitude comes great calculation 
; time.  The one-hour calculation time of today's image should 
; therefore come as no shock.
; 
; But the hour may be saved by viewing the completed image on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The same image is available in high definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The venerable FOTD web site, where the FOTD images have been 
; posted since April 1997, may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Heavy clouds and heavy rain spoiled today here at Fractal 
; Central.  Despite the bad weather, FL spent the day paddling 
; down the Susquehanna River in a kayak, while I stayed dry inside 
; FC, where the recently installed sump pump did its job in the 
; basement.  The fractal cats, who are almost always dry, became a 
; little concerned about FL's absence, but forgot their concern 
; when they caught the scent of tuna.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be alert to the 
; tiny changes around you.
