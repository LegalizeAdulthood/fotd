; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- August 26, 2011 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image departs from the deep theme of the month, but have 
; no concern.  Tomorrow's image will return to the theme in style.
; 
; The parent fractal came about when I iterated the expression 
; Z^(2.23)+C at a level 2.3 turns up the hyperspiral with the 
; 'recip' function applied.  This parent is a sprawling, amorphic 
; thing that looks nothing at all like the pure Z^(2.23)+C 
; Mandeloid as it is drawn by the 'manzpower' formula.
; 
; Today's scene is located in the interior of what might be 
; considered a Seahorse Valley, though its features bear little 
; resemblance to what one would expect to find in a proper 
; Seahorse Valley.
; 
; To begin, the part angular, part parabolic holes in the image 
; are nowhere to be found in the familiar Seahorse Valley.  And 
; nownere in the Mandelbrot set do we find the discontinuities 
; that fill today's image.
; 
; The minibrot at the center is a reflection of the shape of the 
; parent Mandeloid.  Recognizing the various parts is virtually 
; impossible.  The minibrot would be somewhat better defined if it 
; were calculated with a greater maxiter, but doing this spoils 
; the already-shaky color scheme.
; 
; The rating of a 6.5 indicates that I am somewhat disappointed 
; with the image.  When I named the image "The Test of Time" I was 
; pondering the fact that even if the entire universe were to 
; suddenly disappear, this particular scene would exist in 
; potentia for all eternity.
; 
; The calculation time of 8-3/4 minutes is slow by everyday 
; standards, but quite fast by very-deep-math standards.
; 
; The completed image is posted for instant viewing at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition is available at:

; The classic original web site is at:

; 
; Picture perfect weather prevailed at Fractal Central today.  In 
; fact, with its temperature of 84F 29C, kodachrome blue skies and 
; billowing cumulus clouds, the day could have passed for a day in 
; the Caribbean.  The fractal cats, who have spent their lives in 
; Pennsylvania, wouldn't know a tropical-island day from a day in 
; the Arctic.  They were more interested in watching an unfamiliar 
; new black-and-white cat that passed through.
; 
; The humans passed most of the day watching the over-hyped 
; doomsday weather forecasts on the various news-and-commercial 
; channels.  IMO, the storm will be less devastating than the news 
; people are implying.  Here in central Pennsylvania we are 
; expecting little more than a gusty rain on Sunday.  Things could 
; be worse however back at Old Fractal Central down in Central 
; Maryland, where my sister still resides.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and the wise old hermit on the mountain top told me that 
; if I work hard enough, I might be a Boltzmann brain some day.
