; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- August 28, 2011 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image contains a trick -- I lowered the bailout radius 
; to 2, which cuts off the Mandelbrot set at a maximum radius of 
; 1.414.  Then I checked a filament extending from the period-5 
; bud on the northwest shore line of the main bay, very near the 
; point where the filament disappears behind the shrunken bailout 
; radius.
; 
; I found a minibrot, then a smaller minibrot in its East Valley 
; area.  Finally I chose a filament extending from this even 
; smaller minibrot, found a still tinier minibrot on the 
; filament, and zoomed in.  The result appears as today's image.
; 
; Most of the effect is due to the artificially low bailout radius 
; of 2.  To see a more accurate but somewhat less effective 
; version of the scene, recalculate the image with the bailout set 
; to 16.  (Preferably at thumb-nail size.)
; 
; The name "Breaking Boundaries" had something to do with the 
; bailout, but I have forgotten the original connection.  The 
; rating of an 8-1/2 seems about right.  The calculation time of 
; almost 1-1/2 hours is definitely slow however, so thank goodness 
; for the web sites.
;

; 
; Heavy rain and high winds prevailed Saturday night here at 
; Fractal Central as Hurricane Irene passed by 200 miles to the 
; east.  The rain and wind slacked off by midday today, leading to 
; a slowly brightening then clearing afternoon.  The newly 
; installed fractal sump pump did its job, and kept the fractal 
; basement not exactly dry as a bone, but no worse than a few 
; small puddles.  The fractal cats ignored the active weather but 
; approved of the temperature of 70F 21C.
; 
; The fractal humans had a quiet uneventful day, a day that might 
; seem boring to young people but would be just right for the 
; older ones.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and if anything remotely possible must 
; ultimately condense out of the random fluctuations of empty 
; deSitter space, then every possible idea of God must exist in 
; actuality.  In fact, an infinity of every person's God must lie 
; somewhere out there.
