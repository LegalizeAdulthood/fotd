; FOTD -- August 10, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Silver Elephants".  Yes, I realize that 
; elephants are more of a leaden gray color than a silvery one.  
; But the phrase 'leaden elephants' has no oomph.  It wouldn't 
; sell the latest wireless internet device.  So I stretched 
; reality a bit and decided that elephants sometimes might have a 
; silvery sheen about them.  The colors of the image would confirm 
; this fantasy.
; 
; The rating of an 8 is a bit liberal.  I actually feel that the 
; high-magnitude images of this month are becoming rather routine. 
; Their magnitudes are just not large enough.  A more accurate 
; rating might have been a 7-1/2, but what the heck, an 8 seems 
; far better than a 7.5.
; 
; The scene is located on the west shore line of the period-17 bud 
; on the south side of East Valley.  Perhaps the most interesting 
; feature is the near-perfect square with its silvery inner 
; elements and its bits and pieces of elephant trunks twisting 
; outward.
; 
; The calculation time of 51-2/3 minutes is slow, but they say 
; something worth having is worth waiting for, so why not go ahead 
; run the parameter file and risk dissatisfaction.
; 
; The alternative is to remove the risk by viewing the finished 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image is available in high definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today's high temperature here at Fractal Central equalled 
; yesterday's high of 84F 29C, but lower humidity, lots of sun and 
; no rain made it a far more pleasant day.  The fractal cats 
; approved of the outside conditions, but they approved even more 
; when their treat was served.
; 
; The humans had nothing to approve of, but they had nothing to 
; complain about either.  The next in the apparently endless 
; series of FOTD images will be posted in 24 hours.  If all goes 
; well, it could have a far greater magnitude.  Until then, take 
; care, and should someone who wants to know whether God exists 
; ask the Pope or Richard Dawkins?
