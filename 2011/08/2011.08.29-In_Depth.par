; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- August 29, 2010 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Some of the recent supposedly 'deep' scenes in the Mandelbrot 
; set have not been all that deep.  We correct this minor 
; exaggeration with today's scene, which lies at a depth of over 
; 3*(10^97) -- deep enough to truly be considered 'deep'.
; 
; The scene is located at the very tip of the longest filament 
; extending from the north side of the large minibrot on the main 
; spike of the Mandelbrot set.  The minibrot lurking invisibly at 
; the center of today's image lies in the basin of a larger 
; minibrot, which lies in the basin of a still larger minibrot, 
; which lies at the fringe of the basin of the large minibrot on 
; the main spike.  This means the number of elements 'resets' 
; itself several times on the way to the minibrot.
; 
; These 'resetting' points often make the most interesting scenes 
; in the very deep regions of the M-set.  Today's image is a fine 
; example of resetting, otherwise known as anti-bifurcation.
; 
; The rating of a 9-1/2 includes 1-1/2 points for the coloring, 
; which took well over one hour to work out.  The name "In-Depth" 
; refers to the magnitude of the image, which is so great that at 
; the same scale, the entire Mandelbrot set would spread over a 
; space trillions of times that of the visible universe.
; 
; Unfortunately, with great quality comes great time, and today's 
; image is no exception.  The parameter file requires over 2 hours 
; to finish.  The web sites remove this inconvenience however.

; 
; The weather was perfect here at Fractal Central on Monday.  The 
; blue sky was decorated by various types of clouds, which never 
; grew thick enough to hide the sun, while the temperature hung 
; around 73F 23C.  The fractal cats approved of all this.
; 
; The humans also enjoyed the day, which left little to be desired 
; and even less to comment on.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and always save the best until 
; last.
