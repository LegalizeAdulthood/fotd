; 
; FOTD -- August 18, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I believe in honesty in advertising, and when a fractal falls 
; flat, I admit it.  I realize that no one gets rich by being 
; totally honest about their product, but no one gets rich from 
; finding fractals either, so I've got nothing to lose by telling 
; it like it is.
; 
; With a rating of an everyday 7, today's deep scene in the 
; Mandelbrot set barely deserves the word 'deep'.  At the modest 
; magnitude of only 7*(10^15) it is barely beyond conventional 
; math range, but at least IMO, it has a certain interesting 
; quality about it that raises it to FOTD standards.
; 
; The scene lies in the East Valley of a larger minibrot on a side 
; filament of the main filament extending from the bud on the 
; north shore line of the period-2 bud of the M-set.
; 
; I named the image "Elephant Trek".  I see a few hints of 
; elephant parts in the scene, though not quite enough trunks and 
; heads to fully justify the name.
; 
; The parameter file takes 25 minutes to finish.  In today's 
; on-the-go world this might be too much precious time, so save 
; the time by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Or view it in high definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site, with all the images and discussions 
; since April 1997 may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day began mostly sunny here at Fractal Central, and 
; continued this way through a good part of the afternoon.  At 
; post time, showers were in the area, though none had yet reached 
; FC.  The temperature of 86F 30C brought out the best in the 
; fractal cats.  They spent most of the time sleeping.
; 
; While the cats were taking it easy, the humans were doing what 
; needed to be done.  When the necessities were finished, we took 
; it easy also.  It is hardly necessary to state that the next 
; FOTD image will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care 
; and when I was a youngster, I knew that science and technology 
; would be our salvation.  But now I'm not so sure.  What it is 
; doing is making us ever more dependent on the high priests of 
; the 'Church of Science and Technology'.
; 
; I recently overheard a young boy (probably an internet addict), 
; ask how people ever got along when they didn't have cell phones 
; and the internet.  Well, I was around before cell phones and the 
; internet, getting along quite well, the same as everyone else, 
; and I can state that we managed life the same as we are doing it 
; now without the next big technological advance, which will not 
; be developed for another 50 years.
