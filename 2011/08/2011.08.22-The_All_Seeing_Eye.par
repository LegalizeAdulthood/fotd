; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "The All-Seeing Eye".  But there is 
; nothing all-seeing about it.  The image is simply a picture of a 
; minibrot in the parent fractal that results when the formula 
; Z^(2.2)+C is iterated 2.2 levels up the logarithmic hyperladder 
; with the probably erroneous reciprocal function applied.
; 
; This parent is another of those rotated and scrambled Mandeloids 
; that appears to be suffering from the effects of the second law 
; of thermodynamics.  Its entropy is starting to increase, and 
; this increase will continue until nothing but a screen filled 
; with infinitely divided, flat gray fractal sand remains.  (It's 
; too bad that entropy so rarely decreases.  If it did, fractals 
; would spontaneously appear out of nowhere.)
; 
; The scene of today's action is located in a branch of what 
; appears to be a degenerate Seahorse Valley.  I say it appears to 
; be a Seahorse Valley because even though it encloses a period-2 
; bud, in its depths it looks nothing at all like the valley we 
; know so well.
; 
; The terraced effect was achieved by rendering the scene with the 
; 'tdis' option in effect, which colors the points according to 
; how far they have traveled when they finally escape.
; 
; The rating of an 8 is deserved, since I did put at least a 
; little extra effort into the coloring.  The calculation time of 
; 2-3/4 minutes is true when the image is rendered with the passes 
; set to 'b'.  With this particular image, passes=b is the fastest.
; 
; The image may be viewed without the inconvenience of setting up 
; and running a parameter file by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image is available in high definition at:
;

; 
; The 14-1/2-year-old original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
;

; 
; The weather today was ideal here at Fractal Central, with 
; kodachrome blue skies decorated with cottonpuff cumulus clouds 
; and a temperature of 77F 25C.  The fractal cats, who are of very 
; low entropy, spent the day playing with their catnip toys and 
; sleeping.  The humans, of equally low entropy, spent the day 
; doing things that are more human, such as work.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and would 
; all the Boltzmann brains please raise their hands.
