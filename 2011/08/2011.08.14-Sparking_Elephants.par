; FOTD -- August 14, 2011 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's FOTD image we return to the theme of the month -- 
; the land deep within the Mandelbrot set.  We check a minibrot 
; that lies in the East Valley of a larger minibrot that in turn 
; lies just beyond the main spike of the still larger minibrot at 
; -1.417 on the main spike of the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The image rates a lofty 9, one point of which is due to the 
; coloring.  At first I considered adding more colors to the 
; image, but the more I looked at it, the more pleased I became 
; with the subdued blue theme.
; 
; The name "Sparking Elephants" is a play on the word 'spiking', 
; which might not be a word at all.  The spikes are evident 
; throughout the image, pointing straight away from the barely 
; visible minibrot at the center.  And the image does have a kind 
; of electric atmosphere about it.
; 
; The calculation time of 52 minutes is slow enough to make 
; viewing the image on the FOTD web site the better choice.

; 
; Sunday left a lot to be desired here at Fractal Central.  Heavy 
; clouds kept a blanket over the area all day, while intermittent 
; rain killed all hopes of a pleasant day.  The fractal cats 
; showed their fractal nature by being in two places at once.  But 
; since there are two fractal cats, this is not much of a paradox.
; 
; The humans found enough indoor stuff that needed doing to 
; prevent boredom from setting in.  I killed one hour counting the 
; scientific errors in one of those pop-science shows on one of 
; the supposedly 'educational' channels.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and Atheists should 
; be more specific in describing what they *DO* believe about the 
; origin of the universe.  When they claim that 'it all just 
; happened by meaningless cosmic accident', they are not answering 
; the question, they are expressing their ignorance, which leaves 
; them open to attack from believers who feel they 'know' where 
; the universe came from.
