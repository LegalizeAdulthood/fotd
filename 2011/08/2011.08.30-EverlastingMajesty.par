; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- August 30, 2011 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image we're still in the same basin as yesterday's 
; image, though we're on a different branch.  To find today's 
; scene I backed out of yesterday's image until I came to the 
; minibrot in which it lies.  Yesterday's image lies in the main 
; spike area of the minibrot, so to be different, I switched to 
; the East Valley of the minibrot and zoomed in until I found a 
; sub-basin.  Today's image shows a point of anti-bifurcation, 
; (a resetting point), in this basin.
; 
; Once again I spent an unusually long time working on the colors, 
; which earn the image a whopping rating of a 9-1/2.  These 
; ratings might be a bit exaggerated, but IMO I earned the full 
; 1-1/2 point coloring bonus.  Actually, the time spent on 
; coloring is not all good news.  I have more time to work on 
; fractals because, with our biggest commercial customer gone, we 
; have more idle time here at FC.
; 
; To find the name "Everlasting Majesty" I opened a dictionary at 
; random until two words applicable to fractals came up.  The name 
; is really rather appropriate.  Whatever fractals are, at least 
; some of them are filled with things such as majesty, splendor, 
; glory, etc. etc. etc.
; 
; The calculation time is not so glorious however.  On my aging 
; 2000mhz machine it takes a full hour to finish.  The newer units 
; will finish the job in a fraction of the time, but it would take 
; a super-computer to finish the calculation in a few seconds.
; 
; View the finished image on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; View it in splendrous high definition at:

; 
; And remember the classic FOTD site at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Once the morning fog cleared off, the crystal clear blue skies 
; and temperature of 81F 27C made today near perfect here at 
; Fractal Central.  The dynamic duo of fractal cats found full 
; satisfaction in the conditions, though they would have preferred 
; a little more attention from the humans.
; 
; The dynamic humans made it through another uneventful day 
; uneventfully.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and it's possible to move in any direction in 
; the three spatial dimensions.  Why then is it possible to move 
; in only one direction, forward, in the time dimension?
