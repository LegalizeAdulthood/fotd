; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- August 11, 2011 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The FOTD theme for August is deep images in the Mandelbrot set, 
; but until today we have not ventured to any real depth.  Today 
; however we get bold and dive to a depth of over 6*(10^112), 
; where we find a 'reset' (anti-bifurcation) point in the huge 
; basin around a minibrot that is still well beyond visibility.
; 
; The scene is located on a filament extending from a larger but 
; still very deep, (10^59), minibrot on the west branch of the 
; filament extending from the north bud of the large minibrot on 
; the main spike of the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The rating of a 9-1/2 includes a 1/2-point bonus for the extra 
; effort I put into coloring this very difficult image.  The 
; mathematical interest is responsible for another point.
; 
; The name "Deep in the Abyss" refers to the depth of the image.  
; At the scale of the image, the entire Mandelbrot set would be 
; something like a trillion times the size of the visible 
; universe.  (This is a guess.  If anyone wants to do the math, go 
; ahead.  It would be interesting to see how many universes could 
; fit into the main bay of this huge abstract M-set.)
; 
; The great depth comes at a great time price however.  On my 
; 2000mhz unit, the image takes 2-3/4 hours to finish -- slow by 
; anyone's standards.
; 
; When I finish the day's tasks, I might check the minibrot at the 
; center of today's image.  I suspect that it will be little more 
; than a mess of Moire patterns however.
; 
; Those who are put off by spending nearly 3 hours calculating a 
; fractal may make their lives far more pleasurable by viewing the 
; finished image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Or by viewing it in high definition at:

; 
; The original FOTD site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A near perfect day prevailed at Fractal Central today.  The 
; mostly sunny, kodachrome-blue skies were decorated with just 
; enough puffy white clouds to make a picture postcard, while the 
; low humidity and temperature of 81F 27C completed the 
; perfection.  The fractal cats enjoyed the outdoor conditions as 
; much as is possible from the inside.  They spent several hours 
; in the window, watching the clouds and birds pass by.
; 
; If the current economic anxiety is discounted, the humans had 
; another quiet peaceful day, and there is no reason why tomorrow 
; will not be yet another.  One thing almost, but not quite, 
; guaranteed, is that the next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and if the world is doomed to come to an 
; end, have no concern.  The planet will survive.
