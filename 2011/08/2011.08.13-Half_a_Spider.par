; FOTD -- August 13, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The theme of August is fractals from deep in the Mandelbrot set. 
; Today's image is not from the Mandelbrot set however.  It is 
; from the fractal that results when Z^(2.25)+C is iterated 1/2 
; level up the complex logarithmic hyperladder, (actually more of 
; a hyperspiral).  I had to depart from the theme of the month for 
; one day to get caught up.  The very deep images are quite slow, 
; and I have been falling behind.
; 
; The parent fractal appears as a distorted M-set rotated so that 
; its distorted main period-2 bud lies on the north side of the 
; main bay.  There is a small valley on the east side of this bud, 
; with today's image lying in that valley.
; 
; I named the image "Half a Spider".  Spiders have eight legs, but 
; there are only four spidery legs radiating from the central 
; minibrot in the image.  Since four is one-half of eight, the 
; name is quite appropriate.  (The circular disk closer in around 
; the minibrot holds nine legs however.)
; 
; The rating of a 7 places the image just about at the center of 
; FOTD ratings.  The calculation time of under 1-1/2 minutes 
; assures that no precious time will have been wasted if the eager 
; fractalist is disappointed with the image.
; 
; For even more assurance, the finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image is available in high definition at:

; 
; Threatening clouds moved in here at Fractal Central on Saturday 
; morning, and a heavy thunder-shower arrived at 3pm, putting a 
; finish to any outdoor activities.  The fractal cats' outdoor 
; activities are limited to gazing out the windows anyway, so they 
; had no problem with their outdoor activities.  If the day had 
; been dry, the temperature of 79F 26C would have been pleasant.
; 
; The humans, with no outdoor activities planned, had a typical 
; day indoors.  The next FOTD should be posted in 24 hours, which 
; is the typical interval.  Until then, take care, and be a 
; rational skeptic who doubts that physical aliens are visiting 
; earth in flying saucers.  Such visits are impossible.  Due to 
; the cosmic speed limit of light, (186,000mps), there is no way 
; for physical aliens to get here.  If you must believe in some-
; thing irrational, believe in ghosts.  They are very disturbing 
; to skeptical rationalists, but at least they are not impossible.
