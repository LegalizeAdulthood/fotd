; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- August 07, 2011 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image once again takes us rather deep into the 
; Mandelbrot set.  I use the qualifier 'rather' because a 
; magnitude of only 8*(10^19), such as today's, can hardly be 
; considered deep by current standards.
; 
; The scene is located in the Seahorse Valley area of a minibrot 
; on a filament extending from the northwest shore line of the 
; second bud out the main spike of the Mandelbrot set -- the bud 
; just beyond Scepter Valley.
; 
; The rating of a 9 is an honest one that includes a hefty bonus 
; for the extra effort I put into finding the colors.  The rating 
; was also helped by the unusually chaotic yet well-defined 
; 'shield' surrounding the nearly invisible minibrot at the 
; center.  The name "Shield of Chaos" refers to this feature.
; 
; Since the image is of relatively modest magnitude, the 
; calculation time is a relatively reasonable 12 minutes, a span 
; of time that few but the most impatient fractalists will miss.
; 
; For the convenience of the impatient or those with DOSaphobia-
; stricken computers, the finished image is posted for instant 
; viewing at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image is posted in high definition at:

; 
; Partly cloudy skies with a muggy high temperature of 88F 31C 
; made for a lazy day today here at Fractal Central.  The laziness 
; was briefly interrupted in the afternoon by a drenching thunder-
; shower, but within 1/2 hour the sun was again shining and the 
; laziness returned.  The fractal cats, in keeping with the spirit 
; of the day, passed the time being lazy.  At one point, Cassie 
; tried to get fresh with Nico, but the big guy has better sense 
; than to get involved in such activity on such a lazy day.
; 
; The humans did mostly nothing, which is what they are best at, 
; though FL was still recovering from Saturday's wet kayak trip 
; down the river.  The next FOTD, another scene deep in the 
; Mandelbrot set, will be posted in 24 hours.  Another rating of a 
; 9 is not guaranteed however.  Until then, take care, and if you 
; believe that the five physical senses give a true and total 
; picture of reality, then use your common sense and become a 
; materialistic, scientific rationalist.  (Whatever one of them 
; is!)
