; FOTD -- August 09, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's (rather) deep image involves a bit of a trick.  The 
; normal cut-off radius of the Mandelbrot set is 2.  But in 
; today's image I have set the bailout to 3, which causes the 
; calculation to be cut off at a radius of 1.7.  This slices off 
; the tip of the main spike of the Mandelbrot set, but at the same 
; time causes strange things to happen to features that would 
; normally be located far from the cut-off point.  Today's image 
; shows what has happened to a tiny minibrot in the East Valley of 
; a larger minibrot on the main stem, very close to the abnormally 
; small cut-off point.
; 
; I named the image "Pins and Needles" because of the prickly 
; effect dominating it.  The rating of an 8 might easily have been 
; increased to an 8.5 had I not been in a conservative mood when 
; I decided on the rating.  The calculation time of 6-1/4 minutes 
; is quite speedy for an arbitrary-precision image, but then, the 
; magnitude of a mere 5*(10^13) is barely within arbitrary-math 
; range.  (In fact, the image may be calculated in a fraction of a 
; second by using conventional math, but the degradation will be 
; quite noticeable.)
; 
; All this having been said, brace yourself for instant hedonistic 
; pleasure if you decide to view the finished image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; And then be prepared to make a sincere confession.

; 
; Morning rain gave way to some afternoon sun here at Fractal 
; Central today.  A heavy thunder-shower passed over at 5pm to end 
; the afternoon with a bang.  The temperature of 84F 29C would 
; have been more pleasant if the humidity had not been so high.  
; The fractal cats noted a stray cat that passed through the yard 
; in the morning, then spent the rest of the day taking it easy.  
; The humans did the same.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and one cannot become a rabble rouser unless they have 
; some rabble to be roused.
