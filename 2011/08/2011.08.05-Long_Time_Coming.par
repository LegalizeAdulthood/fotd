; FOTD -- August 05, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Long Time Coming".  When you start 
; running the parameter file, you'll know the reason for the name. 
; But as always, relief for the slowness is at hand.  The finished 
; image is posted in glorious 640x480x256 GIF format at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version may be accessed at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; though it might take a short time for Hal to calculate it.
; 
; The original, now classic, FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The slowness of the image is due to its magnitude, which is a 
; whopping 7*(10^34).  With such a great magnitude comes great 
; slowness, and it certainly is evident in today's image.
; 
; Today's image is what I found on a dive into the image of two 
; days ago, with much the same colors and features.  Since the 
; image is kind of a repeat, I could rate it no higher than a 7, 
; which is actually not all that bad.
; 
; I have not done the math, but I would guess that at the scale of 
; today's image, the entire Mandelbrot set exceeds the size of the 
; visible universe many times.
; 
; The M-set is a great example of one-way infinity.  Just like the 
; time we are supposed to enjoy life in heaven, it is limited in 
; only one direction.  It has an infinite depth, but is limited to 
; a value of 2 at its upper extremity.
; 
; The clouds continued here at Fractal Central all morning, but 
; around noon time the clouds broke, leading to a relatively 
; pleasant afternoon, with a near normal temperature of 82F 29C.  
; The fractal cats paid little attention to the outside conditions 
; as they slept through most of the day.  The humans spent the day 
; preparing for tomorrow, when the next FOTD will be posted.  
; Until then, take care, and if those aliens from Sirius-C are 
; really running things here on earth from behind the scene, they 
; had better take a few lessons on how to run a world.
