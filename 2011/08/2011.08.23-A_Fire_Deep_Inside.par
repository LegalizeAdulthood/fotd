; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- August 23, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fiery image shows a scene rather deep in the prominent 
; knot on the longest filament extending from the northeast shore 
; line of the main bay of the large minibrot on the negative stem 
; of the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The rating of a 7.5 includes 1/2 point for the coloring, which 
; admittedly is a bit exaggerated but makes a lively picture 
; nonetheless.
; 
; I have been down to the minibrot at the center, and found it is 
; less interesting than the scene in the image.  The minibrot is 
; surrounded with little more than a multitude of concentric 
; circles with varying degrees of chaos.
; 
; The name "A Fire Deep Inside" has nothing to do with a steamy 
; romance novel.  It refers to the lurid fiery hues filling the 
; image.
; 
; The calculation time of 58 minutes is slow.  The better choice 
; is to view the finished image on one of the FOTD web sites.
; 
; The finished image may be viewed on the official FOTD web site, 
; which may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high definition version is available at:

; 
; Near perfect weather once again prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central today, with lots of sun and a temperature of 79F 26C.  
; But the peace was broken by a sizable earthquake in the 
; afternoon.  The quake shook up things quite a bit and cracked a 
; wall in the city administration building, which had to be 
; evacuated.  The cats of the fractal variety ignored the quake as 
; they slept and chased each other up and down the long hallway.  
; The humans had another day of being busy, which is better than 
; being idle.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and the visible universe is about 27.5 light years in 
; diameter.  But we are seeing the most distant parts in the 
; positions they occupied 13.7 billion years ago, and they have 
; been receding at near light velocity since then.  So how far 
; away are those most distant parts at the present time?  I guess 
; it's all a matter of relativity.
