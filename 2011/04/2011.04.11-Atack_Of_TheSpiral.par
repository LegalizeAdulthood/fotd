; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- April 12, 2011 (Rating New 6, Old 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image features a wild spiral, with more nooks and 
; crannies than the maze of the Minotaur.  Perhaps I exaggerated a 
; bit when I named it "Attack of the Spiral", but some of its 
; nooks look absolutely threatening, not to mention its crannies.
; 
; The image rates a 6, which is equal to an old rating of a 7.  
; This is the last day I will list both the new and old ratings.  
; >From now on I will simply list the new rating.  But remember 
; that images with new ratings will usually appear better than 
; expected.
; 
; For some reason I tend to avoid spirals, perhaps because they 
; are so trendy, especially with contest participants, but occa-
; sionally, as happened today, even I fall prey to the temptation 
; to check a spiral for hidden goodies.  The goodies in today's 
; image are not exactly hidden however.  They are there on the 
; surface for the whole world to see.
; 
; The parent fractal came about when I calculated the Z^(1.5)+C 
; Mandeloid as it appears 0.5 levels up the complex logarithmic 
; hyperspiral when no function is applied.  This parent fractal 
; appears as a Mandeloid rotated so that its main bud faces north. 
; Both its main bay and main bud are squashed, with a lively broad 
; spiral extending from the northeast shore line of the main bay.  
; Today's scene is located at only a small depth in this broad 
; spiral.
; 
; The calculation time of 34 seconds is surprisingly fast.  The 
; finished image may be viewed without the task of calculation, on 
; the active FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original classic FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; My own web site may now be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; but the site is still in the early stages, and today's FOTD will 
; not be posted for a day or so.  Suggestions for improvement will 
; always be considered, so feel free to make helpful comments.  
; You might also check FL's puzzles on the site.  She deserves a 
; little return for all the work she has done helping to get the 
; web site up and running.
; 
; With a high temperature of 81F 27C, Monday was the warmest day 
; of the spring so far here at Fractal Central in central Pennsyl-
; vania.  In fact, it was warmer outside than inside.  The fractal 
; cats considered the temperature just right, but their relation-
; ship must have left something to be desired.  In the evening 
; they were spotted at opposite ends of the fractal hallway in 
; full sulk posture, their sulks directed at each other.
; 
; The day of the humans was busier than expected.  Most of the 
; extra work involved making last minute tweaks to the FOTD web 
; page.  The next FOTD image is due to be posted in 12 hours or 
; so.  Until then, take care, and what will be, will be, but we 
; don't have to sit down and helplessly take whatever comes.
