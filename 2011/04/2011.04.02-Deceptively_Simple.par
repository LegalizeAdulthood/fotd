; FOTD -- April 03, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image appears to show a minibrot near the surface of the 
; Mandelbrot set, most likely the large minibrot on the west 
; branch of the filament extending out from the large period-3 bud 
; on the north side of the main bay.
; 
; Well, in a way this is right, but appearances can be deceiving.  
; The scene does show such a minibrot, however the filament it 
; lies on does not extend from the main period-3 bud, it extends 
; from the period-3 bud of a minibrot near the tip of the main 
; spike of the M-set, at a depth of over 10^33, a depth that is 
; not to be sneezed at.
; 
; The thing that granted the image the honor of being declared 
; FOTD is the smoothness of the color bands, almost giving the 
; impression of a true-color image.  (Such as those *other* 
; fractal programs create.)
; 
; A curious change may be achieved by resetting the bailout to the 
; default 4.  In fact, some may prefer the added detail achieved, 
; though I prefer the pseudo-true-color smoothness.
; 
; The name "Deceptively Simple" refers to the surprisingly large 
; magnitude of the scene.  The smoothly blended coloring earned 
; the rating of an 8.  If I had worked harder, I might have 
; totally eliminated the color bands and raised the rating to an 
; 8-1/2.
; 
; The calculation time of 11-1/2 minutes is quite fast considering 
; the arbitrary precision math and the magnitude.  The finished 
; image may be viewed on the active FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Don't forget the original web site with all the past images at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; My own web site needs only a brief written introduction to 
; fractals before it will be ready to face the judgement of the 
; fractal world.
; 
; Saturday turned rather pleasant and sunny enough, though a bit 
; chilly for the season.  The fractal cats would have preferred 
; things a bit warmer, but were happy enough with the temperature 
; of 52F 11C.  The day of the humans was busy, which is getting to 
; be a routine condition here at FC.  The next FOTD will be posted 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and never be a slave to 
; common sense.
