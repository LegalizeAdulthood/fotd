; FOTD -- April 16, 2011 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image we venture into the parent fractal that comes 
; about when the formula Z^(1.15)+C is calculated at a level 11.5 
; turns down the complex logarithmic hyperspiral when no function 
; is applied.
; 
; The name "Blithe Eidolon", is a fancy way of saying 'happy 
; ghost'.  It refers to the parent fractal, which resembles a 
; chubby but happy ghost flitting merrily off to the east-
; northeast, its short plump arms protruding through its sheet.  
; Today's image is located in a stream of chaotic debris extending 
; from the ghost's upper arm.
; 
; Actually, it's a bit incredible that such fractals exist at all. 
; The value of iterated Z in today's generating expression is 
; 1.15, which is perilously close to unity, a value that cannot 
; create fractals unless it is combined with some other value.
; 
; There might or might not be a minibrot at the center of today's 
; image.  The signs are there, and all the way down it has 
; appeared as though a minibrot would become visible on the next 
; dive, but here we are at the limit of resolution and no minibrot 
; has yet appeared.
; 
; Actually, we need no minibrot.  The image stands on its own 
; merits, and rates a 5, which on the old scale would be a 7.
; 
; The calculation time of 4-1/3 minutes borders on slowness, 
; leaving it to the individual fractal visionary to decide whether 
; the result might be worth the effort.  For those in doubt, the 
; finished image may be viewed on my FOTD web site at:
; 
;      <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image is also available for viewing on Hal's web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; Paul's venerable FOTD web site is still up at:
; 
;      <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Though it is currently inactive.
; 
; Another fine spring day prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Friday, though with a temperature of 61F 16C, it was not quite 
; as warm as on Thursday.  The fractal cats did not concern them-
; selves with the outside conditions, but enjoyed the inside 
; conditions to the best of their ability.  Their only excitement 
; came in the afternoon, when Nicholas sensed a stray cat passing 
; through the yard and leaped to the window to be sure the cat 
; continued on its way.
; 
; The day of the humans was about average.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and when was it 
; determined that ghosts do their haunting wearing old bed-sheets 
; instead of regular clothes?
