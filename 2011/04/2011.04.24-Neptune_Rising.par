; FOTD -- April 25, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us on a journey to Triton, the large moon of 
; the planet Neptune, where we find ourselves in a fractal valley, 
; gazing into the distance toward the giant planet, which is just 
; visible through the haze as it rises slowly above the horizon.
; 
; Actually, the image is a fractal of the evaporated variety that 
; was created by the MandNewt06a formula and brought to life by 
; the 'atan' inside fill.  I rated it at an 8, mostly because I 
; enjoy images that resemble scenes on other worlds.
; 
; The name "Neptune Rising" needs no explanation.  And for the 
; comfort of those whose knees start knocking at the mere thought 
; of the paranormal, the name has no connection to the controvers-
; ial discipline of Astrology.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/4 minutes will pass in a relativis-
; tic flash.  Those who enjoy art more than relativity may see the 
; image, already calculated, on the new Fractal Central FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; There is another benefit of visiting the FC web site: the FOTD 
; discussions posted to the web site will frequently contain 
; controversial stuff omitted from the version posted to the 
; Fractint mailing list.
; 
; For a high definition view of the image visit Hal's web site at:

; 
; Easter Sunday began with clouds and light rain here at Fractal 
; Central, keeping the Easter finery under wraps and the fractal 
; cats in sulk posture.  By afternoon the sun peeked through and 
; the temperature reached 75F 24C, but by then the gaudy colors 
; were gone and it had turned into just another Sunday afternoon 
; in Central Pennsylvania.
; 
; The humans made it through the day with no outstanding events to 
; make the day memorable.  We are not too concerned about idleness 
; however.  If things ever get too slow, there is always that FOTD 
; web site in progress to keep us busy.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and never forget that we have not a ghost of a chance of 
; ever reaching those distant planets and stars, but despite this 
; bad news, the ghosts don't give a sheet.
