; FOTD -- April 13, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a departure from my usual fare of escape-time 
; images.  It was created by the type=dynamic formula of Fractint, 
; a formula that draws time-discrete dynamic system images.
; 
; I have done very little investigation into this kind of stuff, 
; though today's image shows that I might have been unnecessarily 
; neglecting these images.  Who knows, these images, which form 
; regular repeating but ever-changing patterns, could be used as 
; the basis for some award-winning quilting.
; 
; The name "Patterns in Space" describes today's image, which is a 
; pattern filling the otherwise empty space of the screen.  The 
; rating of a new-scale 8 indicates that I consider the image to 
; be notably above average.
; 
; The calculation time of 53 seconds will pass in a flash when the 
; unexpected 'passes' algorithm begins working.
; 
; The trip to a Hal's currently active web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; or my own new site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; to see the finished image posted there will be equally as brief.
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Tuesday began glumly with a steady rain here at Fractal Central. 
; The rain ended at 10am, and the sun appeared at noon, but by 3pm 
; the clouds moved back in, and the rain returned by sunset.  The 
; temperature of 55F 13C was reasonable, though it would have 
; seemed more spring-like with more sun.  The ever-present fractal 
; cats had a typical cat day.  Nicholas had a moment of excitement 
; when he got his foot stepped on, but a few consoling words let 
; him know that no harm was intended.
; 
; The humans also had a routine day.  More of the same is expec-
; ted tomorrow.  Now that the FOTD web site is finally off the 
; ground, I am considering what to do with it.  I am presently 
; considering a picture gallery of the fractal cats in action.  
; Yes, the fractal cats are real living cats, not simply invented 
; fictions to fill space in the FOTD discussions.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and is that a Boltzmann brain lurking over there in the 
; shadows?  Cosmologists tell us that such entities might not be 
; total fantasies.
