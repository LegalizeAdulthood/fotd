; ---------

; FOTD -- April 05, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The skewed minibrot in today's image lies in the Z^(2.1)+C 
; Mandeloid as it appears PI levels up the complex logarithmic 
; hyperladder when no function is applied.  This parent Mandeloid 
; closely resembles the minibrot at the center of today's image, 
; though it is rotated so that the main period-2 bud lies on the 
; north side of the main bay.  This bud has small valleys on its 
; east and west sides.  Today's image lies in the western valley.
; 
; The name "Extra Redundancy" is a play on words.  Since the word 
; 'redundant' implies an overabundance, the word 'extra' is itself 
; redundant.  Today's exponent of 2.1 is also redundant, since it 
; is more than enough to draw the classic Mandelbrot set, which, 
; at least IMO, is the world's best fractal.
; 
; Today's image rates a 7.  The rating of a 7 is getting to be all 
; too routine, so I might recalibrate the rating scale so that a 
; present rating of 7 would become a new rating of a 5.  Then, a 
; present 6 would equal a new 4, and so on.
; 
; Today's image calculates in 5-1/2 minutes, somewhat slower than 
; ideal, but still fast enough to prevent a big disappointment.  
; Those who wish to view without calculating may do so by hopping 
; down to the currently active FOTD web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; The original web site is still available at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; My own FOTD web site is still in the building, checking and 
; adjusting stage, but I have a feeling that I may post the web 
; address in tomorrow's FOTD.
; 
; Lots of clouds spoiled Monday here at Fractal Central, though 
; the temperature reached a mild 63F 17C.  The fractal cats spent 
; several hours waiting for the sun to appear.  Finally, when it 
; did not, they made sympathetic faces and asked for extra treats.
; 
; In the human department, the day was average busy, the web site 
; made progress, and nothing unexpected turned up.  If all goes 
; well, tomorrow could be the same.  The next FOTD fractal will 
; probably be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and I 
; read in the morning paper that some scientists are seriously 
; considering intentionally altering the earth's atmosphere in an 
; attempt to slow 'man-made' global warming.  If they actually try 
; to do so, we will know who to blame for any subsequent disasters 
; due to severe weather.  (Lawyers start advertising now.)
