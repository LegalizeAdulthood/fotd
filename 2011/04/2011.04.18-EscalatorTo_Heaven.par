; FOTD -- April 19, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I recently saw on the list a fractal vaguely resembling a stair-
; way, an image that brought out my full philosophizing tendencies 
; and condensed them into the automated stairway that is today's 
; FOTD image.
; 
; The image resembles a stairway to heaven.  But this is no every-
; day stairway.  It curves upward so sharply that I decided to 
; name it "Escalator to Heaven".  And a person does not need to 
; hold any particular beliefs to ride to the top of the fractal 
; escalator.
; 
; The image was created by the Mystic formula, one that I wrote 
; many years ago, then filed away when I wrote the Mystic2 
; formula.  The parent fractal is little more than an amorphous 
; mass of stuff, with today's escalator on the west side and a 
; smaller stairway on the east side.  (This smaller stairway 
; luckily leads nowhere in the other direction.)
; 
; The rating of a 7 is equal to the old rating of an 8.  The calcu-
; lation time of only 33 seconds will pass in a flash.  But the 
; best way to view the image is to go to the official but far from 
; complete FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; or to Hal's web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; where the image is posted in high definition.
; 
; The original FOTD web site, with the entire back-library of 
; images previous to November 2010 is still up and running at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Monday dawned bright and clear here at Fractal Central, but 
; clouds moved in by 9am and hung around the rest of the day.  The 
; temperature of 64F 18C was mild enough, but would have been more 
; enjoyable if there had been sun to go with the mild conditions.  
; The fractal cats, who care not at all about outside conditions, 
; kept themselves happy indoors.  Nicholas spent the afternoon as 
; a lump under an afghan.  Cassandra slept on the couch.  The 
; humans had an average day, which is all that can be hoped for.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and don't blame me if I use the logical mind God gave me 
; to think logically about religion.
