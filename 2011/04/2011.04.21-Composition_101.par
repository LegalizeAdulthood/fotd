; FOTD -- April 22, 2011 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is strange indeed.  It holds no fine detail, 
; consisting totally of a smooth blending of colors, as smooth, 
; that is, as can be achieved with the 256 colors of the GIF 
; format.  And unlike recent images, today's appears much the same 
; at all resolutions including the lowly 640x480.
; 
; I named the image "Composition-101".  Composition is one of the 
; basic things that makes a picture a work of art, and one of the 
; first things taught in art courses is that the 1/3-1/3 points of 
; a frame are powerful places to place the center of interest of a 
; picture.  I have placed the obvious center of interest of 
; today's image 1/3 of the distance down from the top and 1/3 of 
; the way across from the left -- just where the art instructor 
; would approve.
; 
; With next to no detail to latch onto, I could not give a rating 
; to today's image, which creates more of an intuitive feeling 
; than a visual impression.
; 
; The color palette was largely borrowed from one of Albrecht's 
; images, with only a slight tweaking of a few registers to add as 
; much smoothness as possible.  I suspect that the variation 
; between color monitors will probably undo much of the tweaking 
; however.
; 
; The calculation time of under 3-1/2 minutes is borderline slow.  
; This slight inconvenience may be avoided by viewing the already-
; calculated image at a resolution of 640x480 on the official but 
; unfinished FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The image may be seen in high definition on Hal's web site at>
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; But with today's image, little improvement will be noticeable.
; 
; Paul's web site is still up at: 
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; though it is about 5 months behind.
; 
; I read recently on the list that the four greatest achievements 
; of man are: the invention of Calculus, the theory of relativity, 
; the theory of quantum mechanics, and the discovery of fractals.  
; Each of these things has vastly changed the way we look at the 
; reality of the world we live in, and in some cases has 
; questioned the actual truth of the concept of reality itself.  
; In upcoming FOTD's I will discuss some of my ideas about these 
; topics.  But don't expect my (crackpot?) ideas to agree with the 
; conventional rational scientific doctrine.
; 
; Lots of sun, a brisk wind and a chilly temperature of 59F 15C 
; made Thursday an acceptable day here at Fractal Central.  The 
; fractal cats spent the day watching for the aggressive tomcat 
; that sprayed their front door on Wednesday.  Luckily for the 
; aggressive cat, he never showed up.
; 
; The day of the humans was busy but reasonably under control.  
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and be at peace with things as they are.
