; FOTD -- April 15, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's image I took a trip back in time to 1996 or so, when 
; I was involved with the MandNewt series of formulas (formulae 
; for the over-educated).  I brought up formula number 6 in the 
; series of 12 and entered the parameters 3,2,1,1,2,2.  I had 
; intended on making the final parameter a 3, but struck the 2 by 
; mistake.  I didn't notice the error until I had already found 
; the image, and I was certainly not going to correct it then.  
; Serendipity strikes again!
; 
; The image is a most unusual one -- not a solid image but more a 
; series of clouds of vapor filled with vague patterns.  To keep 
; things from turning too ghostly, a few areas of solid interest 
; are scattered through the scene, with the large dumb-bell shape 
; being most obvious.
; 
; I have long since forgotten what I was trying to accomplish with 
; the MandNewt formulas, but they do make some very interesting 
; images, so they are now a permanent part of my formula collec-
; tion, always ready to produce a surprise or two.
; 
; The name "Something from Nothing" is true of fractals in gen-
; eral.  Fractals are made of numbers, and numbers are pure 
; abstractions.  And from what I am able to gather from the 
; popularized quantum books, the sub-atomic world is also made of 
; numbers -- numbers that do not solidify into particles until we 
; look for them.  The universe is made of numbers -- what a coinci-
; dence.  The universe might be the world's greatest fractal.
; 
; The rating of an 8 would also be an 8 on the old scale.  I was 
; considering a rating of a 9, but at the last minute decided to 
; turn conservative.
; 
; An image like today's always looks best when viewed in high 
; definition, so calculate it at the highest definition available. 
; The finished image may be viewed on Hal's web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; or on my web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The last I checked, Paul's original web site was still up at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Though I have almost given up hope that Paul will ever be able 
; to bring it up to date.
; 
; Spring arrived in full force here at Fractal Central on Thurs-
; day, with sunny skies, light winds and a temperature of 70F 21C. 
; This was ideal for the fractal cats, who purred their approval 
; as they were served their regularly scheduled treats.  FL, who 
; has been eager to get to work on the 2011 version of the fractal 
; garden, took full advantage of the ideal conditions and raked 
; like crazy.
; 
; My day was busy.  I guess most every day will be busy until my 
; web site is up to date, which at the present rate will take a 
; year or so.  For now, the next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, 
; give or take a few.  Until then, take care, and be happy in your 
; play.
