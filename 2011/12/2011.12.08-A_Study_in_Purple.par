; FOTD -- December 08, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is the next to last in the parent fractal that 
; results when 5 parts of Z^(0.7) are subtracted from 5 parts of 
; Z^(0.5) and straight C is added.  The scene of today's action 
; lies in the west branch of the valley leading to the large bud 
; on the north side of the grossly enlarged, violin-shaped main 
; bud of the parent fractal.
; 
; The generating expression is actually the same one that created 
; the previous few days' images, though I simplified things a bit 
; by changing real(p3) in the formula to zero and real(p1) and 
; real(p2) to 5.
; 
; The image is unusual in the amount of detail filling the 
; otherwise commonplace elements surrounding the center minibrot.
; 
; Since the violin theme is beginning to wear a bit thin, I could 
; rate today's image no higher than a 7.5, which, perhaps a bit 
; liberally, includes a half-point bonus for the coloring.
; 
; The name "A Study in Purple" was inspired, if it can be called 
; inspiration, by the purple elements in the image.
; 
; The calculation time of 4-1/2 minutes borders on slowness.  But 
; the web sites once again ride to the rescue.
; 
; The finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The classic FOTD web site is at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; After an inch or so of wet snow overnight, today dawned sunny 
; but chilly.  The sun continued all day, mixed at times with a 
; few clouds, while the temperature settled at a not-too-bad 41F 
; +5C.  The fractal cats spent the day taking it easy and asking 
; for food, while FL spent the day in the never-ending task of 
; re-arranging furniture.  I simply spent the day.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and I wonder who is really behind the scene, running the 
; world.  I hear that the Annunaki from Sirius C might really be 
; running things.  (Or are they from Proxima Centauri?)
