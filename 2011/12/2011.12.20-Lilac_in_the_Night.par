; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- December 20, 2011 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we get back into the realm of high ratings.  
; The rating of a 9 includes a full point for the coloring.  The 
; underlying mathematical elements are pretty good also.
; 
; The generating expression combines 3 parts of Z^(-3.3) with 6 
; parts of Z^(-1.1) and adds (1/C) on each iteration to create a 
; hugely oversized parent fractal that is quite attractive in its 
; own right.
; 
; Once this oversized parent is squeezed onto the screen, it 
; appears as a large bay with a huge ring attached to its 
; northwest side.  Today's scene is located in the trunk of the 
; period-10 elephant on the east side of the large bay.
; 
; The elephant-like features around the perimeter of this bay 
; appear to have additional interesting fractal scenes hidden in 
; them.  I will probably post an additional fractal or two from 
; this area in the upcoming days.
; 
; The name "Lilac in the Night" refers to the purplish areas along 
; the filaments sprouting from the brilliant green elements 
; surrounding the central minibrot.
; 
; The calculation will require a sacrifice of around 3-1/3 
; minutes, a fair enough price for an image rating a 9.
; 
; Those with machines afflicted with DOSaphobia can avoid the 
; hassle of calculation by surfing down to the official FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the image is posted already calculated.
; 
; The high definition version, which brings out hidden surprises, 
; is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And the original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Today was basically unpleasant here at Fractal Central, with 
; heavy overcast, a temperature of 43F +6C, and a raw, damp wind 
; from the northeast.  The fractal cats dislike days like this 
; when no sun appears, and they let their displeasure be known by 
; quarreling over who got the sleep in the warmest spot of all, on 
; the shelf over the radiator in the hallway.
; 
; FL and I spent the day doing routine things such as making minor 
; preparations for the coming holidays, with nothing worth telling 
; taking place.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and a local store has a calendar for sale that 
; features patriotic scenes of America.  The calendar was made in 
; China!
