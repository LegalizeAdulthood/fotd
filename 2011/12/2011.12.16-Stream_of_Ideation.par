; 
; FOTD -- December 16, 2011 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image reminds me of some huge exotic tropical flower, so 
; I named it "Stream of Ideation".  (The connection is admittedly 
; vague.)  The parent fractal was created when, on each iteration, 
; I subtracted 11 parts of Z^(2.1) from 11 parts of Z^(+1.9), then 
; added straight (C).  This parent is a slightly undersized almost-
; Mandelbrot set rotated 180 degrees so that its west end faces 
; east.  I call it an 'almost' Mandelbrot set because of its two 
; obvious differences.
; 
; The most obvious difference lies just beyond the large minibrot 
; on the eastward-facing main stem, where the stem breaks into two 
; branches, each going its own way but perfectly mirrored by the 
; opposite branch.  Another difference exists at East Valley, in 
; this case on the west side of the main bay, where an extra bud 
; has mysteriously appeared in the interior of the valley.
; 
; Today's image does not lie in this extra bud, though it is very 
; tempting to see what exists there.  The image lies on the 
; outside of East Valley, where the details are interesting 
; enough.  (This does not mean I am totally ignoring the inside of 
; the bud.  Tomorrow is another day for another fractal.)
; 
; The usual minibrot lies at the center of image, with its shape 
; obscured by the active inside fill of 'bof61'.  I used this 
; active fill because half of today's image consists of 'inside' 
; stuff.
; 
; The rating of an 8-1/2 includes the usual half-point bonus for 
; the coloring, which really makes the image.
; 
; The calculation time of 4-2/3 minutes borders on slowness.  IMO, 
; it is a fair price to pay for the image however.
; 
; Much of this time may be saved by visiting the official FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; A high-resolution version of the image is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original, now classic, FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A mix of clouds and sun and a temperature of 48F +8C made for an 
; acceptable but slightly boring day here at Fractal Central.  
; We're still waiting for the snow to arrive that will bring a 
; white Christmas.  Unfortunately, it does not appear that any 
; snow is in sight.
; 
; The fractal cats were unconcerned about the lack of snow.  They 
; spent much of the day trying to compromise on who gets to sleep 
; on the scratching post and who gets the new chair.  Nicholas 
; chose the chair before Cassie could make a choice, leaving her 
; with the scratching post.
; 
; We the people spent the day doing routine things, thinking about 
; the coming holidays and making minor preparations.  One thing we 
; never need to think about is the FOTD, which appears on about 9 
; days out of 10.  To prove my point, the next FOTD will be the 
; one for Dec. 17, though with an antiquing trip always possible 
; on Saturdays, do not be surprised if it is late.  Until when-
; ever, take care, and did God create Man or did Man create God?  
; Or are these simply two different ways of saying the same thing?
