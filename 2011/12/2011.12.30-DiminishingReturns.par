; FOTD -- December 30, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Start with Z^2, subtract Z^3, add Z^4, subtract Z^5 then add C 
; on each iteration.  The result is a fractal with a mis-shapen 
; main bay and several large sub-bays.  Large period-2 buds lie on 
; both the east and west extremities of the parent, with spikes 
; extending outward along the X-axis from both buds.  Today's 
; image is located on the spike extending west from the western 
; large bud.
; 
; Luckily, one of the critical points of today's iterated 
; expression lies at zero, which would have saved some tedious 
; calculation if I had not been curious about other critical 
; points.  (A second critical point lies at +0.729323..., which 
; draws a very similar parent fractal.  A point of inflection 
; lies at +0.436117..., but this also draws a very similar image.)
; 
; The name "Diminishing Returns" refers to the nature of fractals. 
; The most interesting Mandeloid is created by raising Z to the 
; power of 2.  As the exponent of Z is increased, the Mandeloids 
; start to look ever more similar, and by the time we reach Z^100, 
; there is almost no difference in the overall appearance or in 
; the smaller details.  In short, the law of diminishing returns 
; kicks in, and the fractals start to all look the same.
; 
; The same law of diminishing returns applies to the magnitude.  
; As we go deeper into a fractal such as the Mandelbrot set, the 
; minibrots we find grow ever more interesting at first, but at a 
; magnitude around 10^25 they begin to all look the same, and by 
; the time we reach 10^100, with some few exceptions, little but 
; nearly identical concentric circles surround the minibrots.
; 
; The same diminishing returns appear as we pile on various powers 
; of Z.  Today's parent fractal combines four different powers of 
; Z in each iteration, yet the image falls far short of some of 
; the images created by the MandAutoCritInZ formula, which 
; combines only 2 different powers.  Out of curiosity, I have 
; written formulas that pile on up to 15 different powers, only to 
; discover that, once again, the fractals all start to look the 
; same.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is near FOTD average, but the calculation time 
; of 12 minutes is too high a price to pay for a merely average 
; image.  Luckily, rescue from boredom may be found at the FOTD 
; web sites.
; 
; The official FOTD web site with the completed image is at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A more-detailed high-definition version of the image is posted 
; at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Another day of uneventful weather prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central today, with mostly cloudy but dry skies, a little sun 
; and an unremarkable temperature of 43F +6C.  The fractal cats 
; were satisfied that no draft fell on their shelf by the window.
; 
; The humans, FL and I, had another in a long string of similar 
; routine days, which are quiet enough, but leave little to 
; report.  The next FOTD, the last of the year, will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  I'm trying to think of a fractal theme for the month 
; of January, so far without much luck.  Until next FOTD, take 
; care, and only 357 days remain before the world ends.
