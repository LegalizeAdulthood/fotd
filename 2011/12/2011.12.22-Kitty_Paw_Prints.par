; 
; FOTD -- December 22, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I saw today's image, my first thought was that the fractal 
; cats had walked across the screen.  But no, it was not the cats. 
; The cat footprints are created by numbers, exactly as fractals, 
; and perhaps the universe itself, are created by numbers.
; 
; In today's case the numbers are 0.45 part of Z^(2) and a tiny 
; trace of Z^(-33), which are combined on each iteration before 
; straight (C) is added.  This unlikely combination produces a 
; somewhat oversized parent fractal with the outer shape of a 
; Mandelbrot set, but the Mandelbrot outline is filled with 
; patterns of overlapping flat disks of various sizes and shapes 
; left over from the trace of Z^(-33).  Today's scene is located 
; in what would be the Scepter Valley of the oversized Mandelbrot 
; outline, though nothing at all of typical scepter elements are 
; visible in the frame.
; 
; What we have instead is a pattern that might have been created 
; by a cat with dirty feet walking across a fractal print before 
; it dried, which explains the name "Kitty Paw Prints".  (It must 
; have been a low-class alley cat.  The fractal cats would never 
; spoil a fractal.)
; 
; The rating of 7 might have been higher if it had not been for 
; the overall muddy appearance of the image.  But what the heck.  
; One person's mud is another person's art media.
; 
; The calculation time of 30 seconds will simply fly by even for 
; those who do not appreciate the finer aspects of mud.
; 
; Avoid the mess by viewing the finished image on the official 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Then enjoy its finer details at:

; 
; The steady rain moved out but the clouds continued here at 
; Fractal Central today.  The un-winterishly mild temperature of 
; 54F 12C kept the day from being a loss -- it made up for the 
; clouds with the heating fuel money we saved.  The fractal cats 
; spent the day just being cats, doing what they wanted to do, not 
; what the humans wanted them to do, while the humans spent the 
; day trying to have a merry pre-Christmas season, which is much 
; harder to actually do than to talk about.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and if we are truly immortal, as the religious believers 
; claim, what could we possibly do to prevent the hell of eternal 
; boredom?  Fractals might keep a soul occupied for a googol years 
; or so, but what would the soul do during the googolplexes of 
; years that would follow?
