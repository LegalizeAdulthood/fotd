; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- December 05, 2011 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's brilliant turquoise image is the third consecutive one 
; with a rating of an 8-1/2.  Perhaps a trend is setting in.  
; 
; The parent fractal, which is shaped like an upside-down heart, 
; (Those with dirty minds might see something else.), came about 
; when I subtracted 2 parts of Z^(-1.5) from Z^(0.5) then added 
; straight C on every iteration.  This parent lies off the default 
; opening screen to the southwest, making an outzoom necessary to 
; bring it into view.
; 
; Most of the action lies in the valley at the southern edge of 
; the main bay of the parent.  Although the valley's position 
; bears little resemblance to the place in a Mandeloid where the 
; East Valley might be expected, the valley's 'east valley' charac-
; teristics are revealed by the typical goofy eyes around the 
; edges of the frame.
; 
; The name "In a Fractal Garden" was inspired by the detailed ring 
; surrounding the central minibrot, which appears to be a wreath 
; of flower blossoms.
; 
; The unusually brilliant coloring is of my own creation and earns 
; the extra half point in the rating.
; 
; The calculation time of 2 minutes is a pretty good estimate.  
; The missing seconds and hundredths of a second are trivial.
; 
; To eliminate the need to calculate, go to the official FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted.  Or visit Hal's web site at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; for the high-definition rendering.
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The dedicated2000mhz fractal computer is still down, but the 
; blue screens it continues to produce carry different messages 
; almost every time they appear.  Some of the more recent error 
; messages are:
; 
; <page fault in nonpaged area>
; 
; <problem is in SPBBCDrv.sys>
; 
; <DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL>
; 
; none of which is of any help.
; 
; Regardless of the message, the result is the same.  The machine 
; locks up and will not restart until it is turned off and sits 
; for an hour or so.
; 
; Clouds were on the increase here at Fractal Central today, 
; though the sunny intervals let the temperature reach 54F 12C.  
; The fractal cats, who were more concerned with being generously 
; fed, ignored the outside conditions.
; 
; The humans passed the day doing human things, which might seem 
; dull and boring, but works well.  The next FOTD will be posted 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and Atheists claim that the 
; natural world, (the one we can observe with our senses and 
; detect with our scientific instruments), is the only thing that 
; exists.  I agree with this, but it is no proof that there is no 
; God or anything else beyond our present range of detection.  If 
; we ever did find something such as heaven, it would become just 
; another part of the ever-expanding 'natural world'.
