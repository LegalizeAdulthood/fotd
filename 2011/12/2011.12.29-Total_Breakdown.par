; FOTD -- December 29, 2011 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The rating of today's FOTD image is a question mark.  I'm not 
; sure how to rate it.  I think this is the first FOTD image to 
; actually make the breakdown of definition its main feature.
; 
; The magnitude of 4*(10^9) is not all that great, but something 
; like a quantum uncertainty principle must exist in Julia sets, 
; which prohibits any trick that might reveal detail beyond the 
; standard Mandelbrot magnitude limit of 10^12.  Actually, such 
; attempts merely shift the decimal point rather than add the 
; imaginary extra precision of extra decimal places to the math.  
; Curiously, when today's image is calculated by the standard math 
; routine used by the type=julzpower formula, the breakdown is 
; notably more severe.
; 
; Today's image is actually part of one of the Julia sets of 
; yesterday's image.  This parent Julia set is filled with 
; variations of today's scene, some of which are worth FOTD status 
; in themselves, and might appear in a future FOTD.
; 
; The name "Total Breakdown" exaggerates the situation quite a 
; bit.  A total breakdown would be either a flat color covering 
; the screen or a screen full of featureless fractal sand.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes is reasonably brief for an 
; image whose rating is a mystery.
; 
; Those who do not enjoy mysteries yet do enjoy fractals may view 
; the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; will reveal even more of the breakdown of precision, though I 
; doubt that any new stuff will be revealed.  Perfect resolution 
; may be achieved only by calculating the image with the 
; type=julzpower formula, which does support arbitrary precision 
; math.  But doing this will increase the calculation time from 
; seconds to days.
; 
; The original, now classic, web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The day began with a brilliant sunrise and a temperature of 21F 
; -6C here at Fractal Central.  But clouds moved in during the 
; morning, and hung around for the rest of the day.  The high 
; temperature of only freezing was near normal, but compared to 
; the well above-average weather we have had so far this season, 
; felt quite cold.  Luckily the wind was light.  The fractal cats 
; spent the day seeking warmth, finally finding it on the shelf 
; over the radiator in the hallway.
; 
; The humans passed the day wondering when everything will fall 
; apart.  With the government paralyzed and unable to switch from 
; hand-out-the-benefits mode to cut-the-benefits-and-raise-the-
; taxes mode, the day of collapse can't be too far off.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, unless the collapse comes 
; before then.  Until next time, take care, and be ready to bite 
; the bullet.
