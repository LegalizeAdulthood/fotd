; FOTD -- December 01, 2011 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal, with its festive colors, came to be when I 
; combined equal parts of Z^(-5) and (Z), then added straight (C) 
; on every iteration.  This harmless appearing combination 
; produced a parent fractal consisting of a rather distorted 
; Mandelbrot set missing its East Valley, with flat disks at the 
; ends of the filaments extending from its buds.  Today's image 
; lies near the point where the filament extending from the north 
; (in this case northwest) period-3 bud disappears into the disk 
; at its end. 
; 
; Since I think the image is actually a bit better than 
; yesterday's, I rated it at a superb 9.  It might have rated a 
; 9.5 if I had put a bit more effort into the coloring.
; 
; The name "Candied Delight" came about when the image reminded me 
; of a box of the hard candies that are so popular at this time of 
; year.  The calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes is quite a cheap 
; price to pay for a 9-rated image.
; 
; But a price is still a price.  The image may be viewed for free 
; on the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition image is at:

; 
; The original FOTD web site is at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; After a few early morning clouds cleared away, total sunshine 
; prevailed here at Fractal Central for the rest of the day.  The 
; strong sun and light winds made the temperature of 46F +8C feel 
; almost balmy.  The fractal cats made the most of the sunbeams 
; streaming in the windows, chasing the sun across the floor and 
; grumbling when it moved. The humans, FL and I, spent the day 
; getting from morning to evening.  It's not too exciting, but 
; what else could one ask for?  (Don't answer that question.)
; 
; The next in the apparently endless series of FOTD's will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and everything that 
; had a beginning in time must have an ending in time.
