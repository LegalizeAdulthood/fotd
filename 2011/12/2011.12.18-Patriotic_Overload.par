; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- December 17, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the same parent fractal as yesterday's.  
; But today, instead of checking East (actually west) Valley, we 
; check the large minibrot on the main spike pf the parent, which 
; is actually a positive spike.
; 
; The first thing we find is that this is no ordinary minibrot.  
; It is a strange thing consisting of a main bay with 3 large 
; lobes -- a north lobe, south lobe and east lobe.  The single 
; main spike terminates in the East Valley of this minibrot, 
; though two large secondary spikes shoot out northeast and south-
; east beyond it.  Today's scene lies in the valley separating the 
; east lobe of this minibrot from the south lobe.
; 
; I named the image "Patriotic Overload" because of the red, white 
; and blue color scheme.  I rated it at a 7-1/2 because the colors 
; are little more than a tweaking of the colors of yesterday's 
; image.
; 
; As for the image itself, it will take 2-1/4 minutes of running 
; the parameter file to make a fair judgement.  My own opinion is 
; that the image is mostly splashy coloring rather than true math-
; ematical interest.
; 
; To see the image without the task of calculation, surf over to 
; the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Its hidden splendor, if any, may be viewed at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; where it is posted in high-definition.
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; where the early years of the FOTD are posted.
; 
; Clouds moved in just after sunrise to shut off the sun here at 
; Fractal Central today, while the temperature reached a high of 
; 43F +6C.  With a brisk wind and obscured sun, this felt cold, 
; but actually the day's temperature was well above normal, as it 
; has been for several months.  The fractal cats must have 
; approved of things, for they chased each other up and down the 
; long FC hallway for a good hour this evening.
; 
; The FC people, FL and I, had an average uneventful day, which is 
; just plain dull, but also real reality, and not the contrived 
; reality they show on TV.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and some erudite scholars have shown that people believe 
; in God because our race has evolved a 'god-module' in its brain, 
; which causes us to believe in such irrational things as 
; invisible magicians in the sky.  I guess we must now believe 
; that the universe was created by the sum of all 'god-modules'.  
; Either this, or it 'just happened'.
; 
; My belief is that we will need to transcend reason to solve such 
; problems as creation.  (Come to think of it, science has already 
; gone beyond reason, but rationalists will not admit it.)
