; 
; FOTD -- December 18, 2011 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a quickie I found in a hurry to get the FOTD 
; caught up to date.  The parent fractal was created by 
; subtracting 2 parts of Z^2 from Z^(33) and adding straight (C) 
; on each iteration.
; 
; This parent appears as the outline of a circle centered around 
; 1.8, with a reasonably intact Mandeloid at its east edge and 
; what resembles a fragment of a main spike at its west edge.  
; Today's scene lies in a valley in an open hole on this spike 
; fragment.
; 
; Since I have never before seen this exact type of valley, I 
; named the image "A New Valley Scene".  I have seen many similar 
; valleys however, and this holds the rating to a modest 6-1/2, 
; one-half point of which is due to the coloring.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-2/3 minutes is a bit dragging.  But 
; once again, the FOTD web sites ride to the rescue.
; 
; The image may be viewed without the job of setting up and 
; running the parameter file by visiting the official FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the image has already been calculated and is posted for 
; instant happiness.
; 
; The high-definition version is waiting to be enjoyed at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed and enjoyed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A chilly day with a mix of sun and clouds, and a temperature of 
; 34F +1C, added nothing to the comfort rating here at Fractal 
; Central today.  The fractal cats spent the day debating which of 
; them owns which piece of furniture.  The humans, FL and I, did 
; little but try to enjoy the season, which is often easier said 
; than done.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and be tolerant of intolerance.
