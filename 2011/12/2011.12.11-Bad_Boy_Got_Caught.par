; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- December 11, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the same large bay of the same parent 
; fractal that produced yesterday's image.  But while yesterday's 
; image was located on the northeast shore line of the bay, 
; today's image lies in a blunt hump on the northwest shore line, 
; just below the valley leading to the smaller bay to the north.
; 
; I named the image "Bad Boy Got Caught", which has no connection 
; with the appearance of the image but could raise a bit of 
; curiosity as to what kind of image might be given such a name.
; 
; The rating of a 7-1/2 is a little above the rating of 
; yesterday's image.  The curvilinear features make the difference.
; 
; The calculation time of 7-1/2 minutes is slower than I would 
; prefer.  Here is where the web sites ride to the rescue.
; 
; To enjoy the glory of the image without the inconvenience of 
; running a parameter file, check the official FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted.
; 
; It is posted in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; After a chilly start here at Fractal Central, with a frosty 
; temperature of 21F -6C, the day turned quite pleasant, with 
; cloudless skies, light winds, and a high temperature of 39F +4C. 
; The fractal cats, who now have two scratching posts in the 
; sunlight, spent most of the afternoon in the sun.
; 
; The humans, FL and I, spent the day taking things easy before 
; the big holiday rush really gets going full steam.  I took a 
; break while I pondered who those alternate versions of myself in 
; the supposed quantum alternate universes might be.  They cannot 
; be me, so they must be either unconscious zombies or other 
; individuals.  Neither option makes sense, but the things modern 
; science tells us have long since stopped making sense.
; 
; One thing that does make sense however is the fact that the next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; maybe I'm the alternate version.  Maybe the original version of 
; myself exists in some alternate universe.  Or to get totally 
; metaphysical, maybe we are all alternate versions of someone 
; else, and that someone else is what believers call God.  No, 
; that cannot be true.  Belief in God is a superstition!
