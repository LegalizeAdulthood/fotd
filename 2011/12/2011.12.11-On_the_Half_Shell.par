; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- December 10, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Due to a not-totally-unexpected antiquing trip out to Big 
; Valley, today's image is a quickie that I found in a hurry when 
; FL and I got back from the day's adventures.
; 
; The parent fractal is a complex thing with several large 
; vertically stacked bays that resulted when I combined 5 negative 
; parts of Z^(-1.5) with 1.5 negative parts of Z^(-4.5) and added 
; (1/C) on each iteration.  The southernmost bay is the largest, 
; and is also the most obviously critical one.  Today's scene lies 
; in the debris on the northeastern shore line of this largest bay.
; 
; I named the image "On the Half-Shell".  Something in it must 
; have reminded me of oysters, though whatever it was has been 
; totally forgotten.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is a come-down from the sky-high ratings of 
; recent images, but it's still above average as far as fractals 
; go.  (At least IMO)
; 
; The calculation time of under 1-1/2 minutes will pass in half a 
; flash, and then you will see if the image was worth the effort.
; 
; The completely calculated image is posted on the official FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; Viewing it there will eliminate all risk of wasted effort.
; 
; The image is posted in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; The sky was mostly sunny today here at Fractal Central, but the 
; temperature of 37F +3C was a bit brisk for leisurely outdoor 
; activity.  The fractal cats made the most of things by staying 
; close to the heat while FL and I were away.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in the near future, whenever that 
; turns out to be.  Until next time, take care, and if someone 
; commits a crime because of a quirk in their brain chemistry, as 
; neuro-biologists tell us sometimes happens, punish the guilty 
; chemicals, not the innocent perpetrator.
