; FOTD -- December 02, 2011 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Mandelbrot sets come in all sizes and shapes, but the parent 
; fractal of today's image, which came into existence when I 
; combined 0.72 parts of Z^(1.4) with 0.72 parts of Z^(-1.4) and 
; added (1/C) on every iteration, is the most distorted Mandelbrot 
; set that I have yet found.
; 
; To begin, it is rotated 180 degrees so that its East Valley lies 
; on the west side of its main bay.  To add to the strangeness, 
; its apparent main bay is filled with debris of all sizes and 
; shapes, and to complete the weirdness, the inner outline of this 
; debris field is the true shore line of the bay, with all the 
; expected buds in fragmentary form.
; 
; Despite all the attention I have given to the parent fractal 
; however, the parent is not the FOTD for today.  Today's fractal 
; is a scene in the East Valley area of the parent, well inland 
; from the traditional shore line.
; 
; When I first saw today's image, it reminded me of a fantastic 
; radio antenna, perhaps broadcasting fractal information 
; throughout the galaxy.  I immediately named it "Interfractal 
; Antenna" and rated it at an 8-1/2, with the extra half point 
; being a reward for the coloring.
; 
; As far as I have examined, there are no minibrots in today's 
; image, which is unfortunate.  If minibrots were lurking in the 
; depths, they would be of a most interesting variety.  The nest 
; of various sized circles filling the antenna mesh partly make up 
; for the lack of minibrots however.
; 
; The calculation time of under 1-1/2 minutes will be no problem 
; for dedicated fractal fans.  The brief calculation time will 
; also make quick work of checking the parent fractal, which I 
; have made such a fuss about.
; 
; Avoid calculation altogether by viewing the finished image on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is posted at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; It might be windy in southern California, but once the fog and 
; frost cleared off today here at Fractal Central, the weather was 
; quite peaceful, with a mix of clouds and sun.  The temperature 
; of 45F +7C was just about average for the start of December.  
; The fractal cats approved of these conditions,, while the humans 
; had another uneventful day.
; 
; The next FOTD is scheduled to be posted in 24 hours, though it 
; could be later if a shopping expedition arises.  Until whenever, 
; take care, and in the song 'The Twelve Days of Christmas', the 
; gift given on the fourth day is four *calling* birds.  I have 
; never been able to determine exactly what kind of birds are or 
; once were known as calling birds.  Could the word 'calling' 
; originally have been 'collied', meaning blackened by coal soot, 
; perhaps in thoroughly polluted 19th Century London?
