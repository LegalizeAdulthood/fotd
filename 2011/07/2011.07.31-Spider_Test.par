; FOTD -- July 31, 2011 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is one in a series of tests, which is what I named 
; it.  I originally calculated the image with the passes set to 1. 
; The resulting image took near 16 minutes to calculate, but was 
; pictorially perfect.  The passes=g option was fast enough but 
; left too many holes in the web.  Passes=b finished in 5 minutes, 
; but totally missed the web.  This left me with passes=t, which 
; finishes in just under 10 minutes, and misses only a few minor 
; bits of the spider web.
; 
; The image lies in the parent fractal that results when 10 
; negative parts of Z^(-1.1) are combined with Z^(-11.1) before 
; (1/C) is added on each iteration.  This parent fractal is 
; another of those indescribable ones that appear when double 
; negative powers of Z are calculated.  And since the powers are 
; negative, the fractal is subject to evaporation.
; 
; Today's image is an evaporated one, though instead of setting 
; the bailout to one-googol, I set it to 10^40, which is still 
; large enough to evaporate the scene.
; 
; The rating of a 6-1/2 is an improvement over recent images, 
; though still far short of traditional FOTD quality standards.  
; The image may be thoroughly enjoyed by running the parameter 
; file, or by viewing it on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is at:

; 
; The original FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Saturday and Sunday here at Fractal central were near perfect 
; days, with tons of sun, lower humidity and a near perfect 
; temperature of 88F 31C.  The fractal cats enjoyed the conditions 
; as much as is possible for cats to enjoy a thing, while the 
; humans had a pleasant two days.  The next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and let your mind soar to the 
; stars.  Your body is stuck to the ground.
