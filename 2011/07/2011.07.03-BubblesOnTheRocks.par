; FOTD -- July 03, 2011 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates a question mark because I'm not even sure 
; that it's a true fractal.  It looks more like a 'painting' by 
; one of those 'modern' artists who have more showmanship than 
; skill and make up for their lack of ability by manipulating the 
; gullible public into paying good money to see their awkward 
; efforts.  But then again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, 
; so who can say for sure that something like today's FOTD image, 
; with its awkward colors and shapes, is not real art.  Certainly 
; not myself!
; 
; I named the image "Bubbles on the Rocks" for some reason that I 
; have long since forgotten.  It came into being when I started 
; fumbling with the Mystic2 formula, which draws nothing but empty 
; circles unless the inside is set to an active fill, such as the 
; 'bof60' fill that creates the action in today's image.
; 
; The bottom edge of the image is 'outside' stuff.  The crazy 
; detail that fills most of the frame is actually 'inside' stuff 
; made manifest by the 'bof60' fill.  This is chaos carried to the 
; extreme, with no signs of a unifying theme either in the shape 
; or coloring.
; 
; The image calculates in only 55 seconds, so why not go ahead and 
; calculate it despite my less-than-favorable comments?  After 
; all, one person's junk is another person's treasure.
; 
; For the convenience of those who do not calculate parameter 
; files, the image is posted, already calculated, at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The hi-def version is available at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; And don't forget the venerable FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; A typical summer day passed uneventfully here at Fractal Central 
; on Saturday, with sunny but rather hazy skies and a temperature 
; of 88F 31C.  The fractal cats also lived the day uneventfully, 
; not realizing the exciting life they might have had if we had 
; decided to let them be indoor-outdoor cats.
; 
; The day of the humans was routine, as life tends to become in 
; its third stage.  The present plans are to post the next FOTD in 
; 12 hours, but even the best laid plans sometimes go awry, so 
; check to see what happens.  The next image is already safely on 
; disk and ready to fly.  Until whenever, take care, and life 
; comes in three stages -- early, middle and late.
