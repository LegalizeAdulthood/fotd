; FOTD -- July 27, 2011 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image gets no rating because it is not of my own 
; creation.  I picked it up quite a few years ago, probably from 
; somewhere on the internet, and found it in my storage bin a 
; couple days ago.  The reset=1730 in the parameter file shows 
; that it was created with an older version of Fractint.
; 
; I named the image "Bad Moon on the Rise".  Well, it does show a 
; circle that easily could be a moon rising behind a landscape of 
; who-knows-what.
; 
; The image was created by the fn(z)+fn(pix) formula, one I almost 
; never even think of using.  But since images like today's are 
; possible with this formula, maybe I should think about it a 
; little more.
; 
; The calculation time of 24 seconds is fast by any standards.
; 
; The finished image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; And in high definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original FOTD site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Tuesday here at Fractal Central brought a temperature of 90F 32C 
; and a few light passing showers.  The fractal cats slept away 
; most of the day, while the humans kept the mundane things going. 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 48 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and don't believe all those doomsday forecasts you hear 
; about.  So far they have been 100-percent wrong.
