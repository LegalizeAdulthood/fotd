; FOTD -- July 15, 2011 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image earns a rating of a mere 4, which I admit is below 
; average.  It is simply another everyday scene in East Valley of 
; the Mandelbrot set.  The actual location is in the Seahorse 
; Valley of the large minibrot on the shoulder of the period-18 
; elephant on the south side of East Valley.
; 
; I did put a small extra effort into the coloring, though not 
; enough to earn the standard half-point bonus.
; 
; The name "A Simple Diversion" describes the image, which came 
; about almost accidentally as I noodled at the fractal keyboard.
; 
; The calculation time of an even 10 seconds will put no time 
; pressure on even the busiest fractalist.  But running parameter 
; files is still a nuisance.  To make things as simple as 
; possible, check the finished image at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; or the high-definition version at:

; 
; Thursday and Friday here at Fractal Central were virtually 
; identical, with lots of sun, wispy clouds, low humidity and a 
; temperature of a comfortable 84F 29C.  Conditions were so 
; pleasant that the fractal cats passed the chilly morning hours 
; curled in their cold weather positions.
; 
; Little of note happened in the human world, but not so with 
; fractals, which always have existed and always will exist.  If 
; fractals are merely an invention of the human mind however, they 
; have no reality at all, and will cease to exist with the demise 
; of the last person who knows about them.
; 
; The next FOTD, for better or worse, will be posted in 48 hours.  
; And it should not be too long before we return to the every-day 
; schedule.  Until next time, take care, and maybe fractals are 
; not the only semi-real things that are creations of the human 
; mind.
