; FOTD -- July 11, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a simple recoloring of a non-FOTD image I 
; posted several weeks ago.  The coordinates show that the scene 
; lies on the north-northwest shore line of the main bay of the 
; Mandelbrot set, though I have forgotten the exact location.
; 
; The name "The Pale Fractal is Alive" is a comment on the pale 
; colors.  Such paleness may be considered a fault, but at least 
; in my opinion, the paleness in today's image is a virtue.
; 
; The rating of an 8 is true 'in my opinion' also.  Those who 
; enjoy their fractals with intense colors may consider the rating 
; overblown.  I consider it only a little if any exaggerated.
; 
; The calculation time of 28 minutes is no exaggeration.  The 
; magnitude of over 2*(10^31) requires arbitrary precision math 
; with all its slowness.  But all is not quite as bleak as it 
; seems, for the finished image will sooner or later, more likely 
; later, be posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version will be posted notably earlier at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; while the original web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Sunday turned into another perfect day here at Fractal Central.  
; The digital blue skies were made all the bluer by the cottonball 
; white cumulus clouds, while the temperature hung around a pleas-
; antly warm 86F 30C and the humidity remained at a reasonable 
; level.  The fractal cats spent most of the day sleeping, 
; Nicholas on the top of the secretary and Cassie on a chair.
; 
; The humans spent the day trying to enjoy the day, which is a 
; sure way to not enjoy it.  The next FOTD will be posted in 48 
; hours.  It might be another very deep one in the Mandelbrot set. 
; Until then, take care, and if anyone knows how we might bring 
; about the kind of outer-space adventures we see on sci-fi TV, 
; please let me know.  (I guess I should note the word 'fiction' 
; in the phrase 'Science Fiction'.)
