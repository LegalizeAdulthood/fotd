; FOTD -- July 17, 2011 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in an everyday Mandelbrot set that has taken 
; on order-7 characteristics in its deeper depths.  To find the 
; scene we start at the period-4 bud on the northeast shore line 
; of the parent M-set then go to the largest minibrot on this 
; bud's filament network.  This minibrot is still a reasonably 
; normal one, but when we check the minibrot on this minibrot's 
; main stem, we find that it is well along the way of morphing 
; into an order-7 minibrot.
; 
; Zooming in even farther, we check the area where the larger 
; minibrot's main stem joins the smaller morphing minibrot, an 
; area we might call the East Valley area of the smaller minibrot. 
; We notice that the main stem branches into a series of shallow 
; spirals before it enters the actual bay.  We check one of these 
; spirals.  By the time we have gone deep enough to find an even 
; smaller minibrot in the spiral, the minibrots have all totally 
; morphed into order-7 shapes.  Today's image shows one of these 
; order-7 minibrots.  The curved arms radiating from the minibrot 
; indicate that the scene lies on a shallow spiral network.
; 
; But all this confusing verbal description totally fails to give 
; a visual impression of today's image.  To enjoy the image, it 
; will be necessary to run the included parameter file, which runs 
; in 5-2/3 minutes, or to surf to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; to view the finished image there.
;

; 
; The name "7-armed Heptafractal" was of my own invention.  Anyone 
; who knows exactly what it means also knows where the Tropic of 
; Sir Galahad is located and what the song 'Stairway to Heaven' is 
; all about.
; 
; The rating of 7-1/2 indicates that I consider the image a little 
; better than normal, but nothing to write home about.
; 
; Heat returned to Fractal Central on July 16 as the temperature 
; reached 88F 31C.  The day was saved however by the humidity, 
; which remained on the dry side all day.  The fractal cats passed 
; the day lounging on the living room floor, avoiding the sunlight 
; that occasionally filtered through the trees.  At post time on 
; the 17th, the weather was looking like a repeat of the 16th.
; 
; The day of the humans on the 16th was acceptable, as are most 
; days here at FC.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, but 
; hopefully, by the end of the week, we'll have the FOTD back on 
; its traditional every-day schedule.  Until next time, take care 
; and have fun dreaming of trips into interstellar space.  You're 
; surely never getting there in person.
; 
; But isn't it curious that we have evolved the ability to dream 
; dreams and feel desires that have no chance of being realized.  
; One would wonder what the evolutionary advantage of such a 
; frustrating ability might be.
