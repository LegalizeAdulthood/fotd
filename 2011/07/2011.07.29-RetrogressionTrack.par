; FOTD -- July 29, 2011 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Sometimes the names of the FOTD images almost take on a life of 
; their own.  For some strange reason, the name "Retrogression 
; Track", which came to mind out of nowhere, seems so right that 
; I had no choice but to give this name to the image, even though 
; the name has no logical connection with the image.
; 
; The image is an evaporated one, which lies in the parent fractal 
; that results when 2.8 negative parts of Z^(-1.8) are combined 
; with 0.2 negative part of Z^(-5.5) and (1/C) is added on each 
; iteration.  This parent fractal consists of three large, nearly 
; circular bays surrounded by three even larger irregularly shaped 
; bays.  Today's scene lies in an irregular circular ring that 
; terminates a fairly normal filament extending from the southern 
; irregular bay.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is another in a string of July disappoint-
; ments.  We all enjoy those images that rate an 8 or a 9.  Such 
; images are sometimes hard to find however.  If they could be 
; found at will, they would no longer be worth a high rating.
; 
; The calculation time of 5-3/4 minutes is a bit slow for an image 
; that rates merely a 6.
; 
; The finished image is available online at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>
; 
; The original classic FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; At this point I am tempted to write a paragraph or two about the 
; stupidity of politicians on the left as well as the right, but 
; in the name of brevity and to avoid offending, I will count to 
; ten and hold my peace.
; 
; Typical lazy midsummer weather continues here at Fractal Cen-
; tral, with daytime temperatures around 90 tempered by occasional 
; showers.  The fractal cats enjoy such lazy conditions.  They 
; pass the days doing nothing, which is more than the humans can 
; do.  The next FOTD will be posted in 48 hours on July 31, and 
; after that, the images will be posted every day, as has been the 
; usual FOTD schedule for 14-1/2 years.  Until then, take care, 
; and before the answer can be found, the problem must be fully 
; understood.
