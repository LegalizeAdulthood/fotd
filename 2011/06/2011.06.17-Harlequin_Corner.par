; FOTD -- June 18, 2011 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we return to the warhorse MandAutoCritInZ 
; formula and one of the near-infinite variety of fractals it 
; creates.
; 
; The image came about when I combined 1.5 negative parts of 
; Z^(-5.8) with 3.6 negative parts of Z^(-1.6) and added (1/C) on 
; each iteration to produce one of those indescribable double-
; negative parent fractals with multiple stacked bays and 
; filaments terminating in rings.  The image is located at the tip 
; of a filament extending from a bud along the shore line of one 
; of the bays.  The excessive colors held the rating to a 7, but 
; also inspired the name "Harlequin Corner".  The 'corner' part of 
; the name is a meaningless afterthought.
; 
; The color palette is a random one created with one casual strike 
; of the <enter> key.  It needed no tweaking.  After all, how can 
; a random palette be tweaked to make it more random?
; 
; The image is a very fast one, finishing in a lightning-fast 43 
; seconds on my P4-2000mhz unit.  With the image being so fast, no 
; one should have a reason not to run the included parameter file 
; and enjoy the resulting happiness.
; 
; For the convenience of those who do not run parameter files, the 
; finished image appears on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; A high-definition version is posted at:

; 
; A mix of sun and clouds, with more clouds than sun, made Friday 
; a day that left room for improvement here at Fractal Central.  
; The temperature of 81F 27C was close to ideal however.  The 
; fractal cats had a typical cat day.  They awoke at daybreak, 
; meowed for their breakfast, meowed for their dinner, and meowed 
; for their evening treat.  The humans, who sometimes feel like 
; the cats' servants, had an otherwise uneventful day.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, without a guarantee of prompt-
; ness of course.  Until then, take care, and go out to protest 
; actively or stay home and complain quietly.  Regardless of what 
; you do, nothing will change.
