; FOTD -- June 14, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us ever deeper into the world of near-
; linearity.  The exponent of Z in today's image is 1.009.  Both 
; common sense and instinct tell us that a fractal with an 
; exponent so close to unity can only be a lopsided circle or a 
; featureless ellipse at best.  But as is the case with so many 
; things that are known to be true in the world of science, common 
; sense and instinct are wrong.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's scene is an ellipse, that's for 
; sure, but when calculated at the particular height of 4.45 
; levels up the logarithmic ladder, the ellipse becomes irregular 
; along its edges.  Today's image shows a close-up of some of this 
; irregularity.
; 
; I named the image "Tsunami-Plus".  The reason for the 'tsunami' 
; part of the name is obvious.  The 'plus' refers to the shaft of 
; total chaos shooting down and disappearing behind the wave.
; 
; The rating of an 8 expresses my opinion of the mathematical 
; worth of the image.  If I had put more effort into the coloring, 
; I might have given the image more artistic value and worked the 
; rating up to an 8-1/2.
; 
; The calculation time of 4-1/2 minutes will pass in a flash once 
; the peak of the mighty wave appears, decorated almost like the 
; wave in the famous Japanese drawing.
; 
; The image is posted, fully calculated, on the official FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and in high definition with possible variations at:

; 
; Sun, clouds and a temperature of 75F 24C made Monday a 
; refreshingly pleasant day here at Fractal Central.  At least the 
; fractal cats thought so.  They reverted to their winter curl-up 
; modes.  The humans spent the day doing routine things such as 
; gardening and serious work.  The next FOTD, likely another in 
; the how-low-can-you-go series, will be posted in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and all good things must come to an end, 
; but so must all bad things.  In fact, everything with a 
; beginning in time must come to an end in time.
