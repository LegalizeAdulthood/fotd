; FOTD -- June 23, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I wrote the description of the 'On the Wrong Track' image 
; of June 21, I assumed that when the sequence of elements 
; switches to order-7, the series increases in powers of 7.  But 
; when I checked, I found that the series actually grows by 
; doubling the 7 elements, making a 7,14,28... sequence.  My hasty 
; error, which was first noticed by Hal, is made obviously clear 
; in today's image, where the continued doubling of 7 is quite 
; apparent.
; 
; The scene is the area immediately surrounding the central 
; minibrot of the June 21 image.  I have intensified the colors to 
; bring out the background pattern, where smaller order-7 
; minibrots fill the scene to infinity.  Unfortunately, the 
; magnitude of the image is at the limit of resolution, and these 
; smaller minibrots are mostly beyond reach.
; 
; The rating of an 8 includes a generous full-point reward for my 
; coloring work, which I admit did make use of another program, 
; but also manages to bring out some otherwise almost invisible 
; inner detail and fills the screen with rarely seen shades of 
; intense blue.
; 
; The name "Crack in Ringworld" gives recognition to one of my 
; favorite sci-fi series.  It also refers to the crack in the 
; expected smooth 'powers of two' sequence.
; 
; The calculation time of just under 5 minutes is a bit on the 
; slow side.  Boredom may be held at bay however by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; and by viewing it in high-definition at:
; 
; <http://www.emarketingiseasy.com/TESTS/FOTD/jim_muths_fotd.html>

; 
; A typical summertime day passed uneventfully here at Fractal 
; Central on Wednesday.  The temperature of 88F 31C was a little 
; too warm for total comfort, while the clouds were a little too 
; prevalent for sun lovers.  The forecast of numerous showers 
; proved to be a scare tactic, as not a single drop of rain fell.
; 
; The fractal cats alternated between taking it easy and chasing 
; each other up and down the hallway.  The humans had a typical 
; uneventful day.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and Atheism is doomed to forever remain 
; an unconfirmed philosophy.  (Just like Theism?)
