; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "A Minibrot in Heaven".  My concept of 
; heaven is a place that everyone says is wonderful, but no one 
; wants to go to.  In my opinion, the reason for this contradic-
; tion is that we're not sure that heaven really exists.  In a 
; world built on science, faith does not carry the power it once 
; did, and the world's religions appear helpless to do anything 
; about it.  What do I think of all this?  Well, I spend time 
; wondering whether there are fractals in heaven.
; 
; Today's image offers a little hope of the beyond.  It shows a 
; minibrot floating through the etherial realm of heaven.  This is 
; the same minibrot that I mentioned in yesterday's discussion, 
; and indeed, yesterday's scene lies within the brilliant white 
; arc just southwest of the minibrot in today's scene.
; 
; Just as in yesterday's image, the better part of today's image 
; is inside stuff made visible by the 'bof60' inside fill.  A good 
; part of the outside stuff has evaporated away.
; 
; The image rates an 8.  It might have rated as high as a 9 if the 
; muddy left-over 'outside' debris in the upper part had not been 
; so intrusive.  There could be a way to eliminate this stuff, but 
; once again laziness overtook me and I decided to let the image 
; go as is.
; 
; The calculation time of under 1-1/2 minutes will test the 
; patience of no one.
; 
; The completed image is posted on the FOTD web site at:

; 
; Friday here at Fractal Central was another perfect early June 
; day.  The temperature of 77F 25C is right in the middle of the 
; comfort range, and the humidity of 45 percent simply added to 
; the comfort.  The fractal cats spent most of the day being 
; comfortable, doing what cats do when they are comfortable.  They 
; stretched out on the carpet.
; 
; The day of the humans, (not to be confused with the day of the 
; triffids), was slow.  FL got caught up on some gardening, while 
; I got caught up on some fractals.  The next FOTD is due in 24 
; hours, but if one of those antiquing expeditions comes up, it 
; might be late.  Until whenever, take care, and what if we dis-
; cover that heaven is really not there? . . . Gulp!!
