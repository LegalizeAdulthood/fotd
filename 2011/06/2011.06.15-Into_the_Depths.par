; FOTD -- June 15, 2011 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD image is late, but it's still worth the effort of 
; a trip to the FOTD web site.  In the image we venture ever 
; closer to the point of total linearity.  In fact, since 
; yesterday's image we have gone half-way to unity.
; 
; The value of the exponent in today's image is 1.0045, yet it 
; still creates fractals with interesting detail.  There must be 
; something special about the point 4.45 levels up the log ladder 
; when the 'recip' function is applied.
; 
; Regardless of which mathematical quirk the image came from, it 
; is worth a rating of an 8, much of it due to the mathematical 
; factor.
; 
; If I had had more time to work on the coloring, I might have 
; raised the image to a rating of an 8-1/2.  As it is, I devoted 
; most of the color work to creating the 3-D effect in certain 
; areas.
; 
; The name "Into the Depths" describes the fall toward unity.  
; Though today's image is quite close to the limit, I would not be 
; surprised if tomorrow's is even closer.  Check back to see.
; 
; The image may be seen without the nuisance of calculating it by 
; checking the FOTD web site at:

; The hi-def version is posted at:

; 
; Tuesday was a bit chilly but otherwise very pleasant here at 
; Fractal Central, and the clouds were spectacular.  The fractal 
; cats thoroughly appreciated the temperature of 66F 19C, 
; reverting to curl-up mode for their afternoon siestas.  The 
; humans, who were out of town all afternoon, let them sleep 
; undisturbed.  The next FOTD will be posted in just a few hours.  
; Until then, take care, and what will those who base their world 
; view on the reality of the material universe do, if it turns out 
; that everything is an illusion?
