; FOTD -- June 05, 2011 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Due to an antiquing expedition on Saturday, today's image is a 
; super-quickie, both in calculation time and the time I spent 
; creating it.  It came about when I casually subtracted 0.67 part 
; of (1/Z) from 0.67 part of Z^2, which resulted in a parent 
; fractal consisting of a single large distorted Mandeloid with 
; disconnected debris scattered around it.
; 
; The north period-3 bud is the largest bud on the main bay of 
; this parent Mandeloid.  This bud has a prominent zig-zagging 
; filament extending from it and terminating in a jagged string 
; of connected holes.  The string of holes is mirrored many times 
; in today's image, which is located near the point where the 
; filament joins the string.
; 
; The image rates a 5, about as low as an image can go and still 
; qualify for FOTD status.  The name "Iterative Old One" does not 
; refer to the fractalist.  It refers to the image, which had 
; potentially existed for all eternity before I stumbled upon it.
; 
; The calculation time of 20 seconds is about as fast as an image 
; can be, (unless the image is type=mandel or type=julia).
; 
; The finished image is posted at:
; 
;       <http://www.crosscanpuzzles.com/Archives.html>
; 
; The high-definition version is at:

; 
; The original web site is at:
; 
;       <http://www.Nahee.com/FOTD/>
; 
; Saturday here at Fractal central began sunny, but clouds moved 
; in during the afternoon and built until a lively thunder-shower 
; erupted at nightfall.  The fractal cats had no complaints about 
; the temperature of 77F 25C, but did not enjoy the noisy thunder.
; 
; Meanwhile the humans had an acceptably pleasant day.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted within 24 hours.  Until next time, take 
; care, and if you hate those big greedy corporations that pollute 
; the environment and take money from the people, punish them by 
; no longer using their products.  But if you need these products 
; to maintain your life style, don't make yourself a hypocrite by 
; speaking out and protesting.
