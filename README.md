# Fractal of the Day

These are parameter files for rendering Jim Muth's Fractal of the Day
images.  The parameter files can be used with [Iterated Dynamics](https://github.com/LegalizeAdulthood/iterated-dynamics)
to render the associated fractal image.

# [Image Archive](https://user.xmission.com/~legalize/fractals/fotd/)

Most of the PAR files have already been rendered as high-resolution 1600x1200 images
at the link above.

# Grouped by Volume

Les St. Clair grouped together all the Fractal of the Day par files
and formulas and grouped them by volume, one volume per year.  These
are more convenient for browsing/loading the entire collection.  These
parameter and formula files are in the grouped directory.

# Contributing Missing Dates

If you have PAR files for dates not represented here (2003 through 2016 are
believed to be complete), please open an issue and attach the missing PAR
files (copy/paste may corrupt inline color table entries, so attachments are
preferred).  A ZIP archive can be attached to an issue as well, so you needn't
attach individual PAR files.

If you're knowledgeable about git and github, then pull requests are also
acceptable!
