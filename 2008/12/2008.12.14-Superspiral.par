; FOTD -- December 14, 2005 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Sorry for the lateness fractal folks, but with all the shopping 
; and graphics work, Saturday was just a bit too busy to produce 
; an acceptable FOTD by the usual post time.
; 
; For some reason, spirals are quite popular among those who 
; aspire to turn fractals into fine art.  Since I would like 
; nothing better than being a world renowned and fabulously 
; wealthy 'fractal artist', I decided to post a spiral that I 
; found in a couple minutes late Saturday evening.
; 
; The parent fractal pictures a Mandelbrot set well along the way 
; to becoming something else.  I'm not sure what 'something else' 
; is, but the result resembles a swiss cheese filled with bits 
; and pieces of stuff with Mandelbrot buds.  Today's scene is 
; located in some of this cheesy stuff in the northwest part of 
; the parent.
; 
; I named the image "Superspiral" perhaps a bit too enthusiastic-
; ally.  Considering the way the spiral rotates when the colors 
; are cycled, I could just as easily have named it something like 
; 'Pinwheel".  I could not take the image seriously enough to give 
; it a rating however.
; 
; Adding to the difficulties is the fact that the calculation time 
; of over 11 minutes is simply too slow for a commonplace fractal 
; spiral.  But this little difficulty may be overcome by viewing 
; the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it is or soon will be posted for instant viewing pleasure.
; 
; Partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 32F 0C were just enough 
; to keep the fractal cats happy here at Fractal Central on 
; Saturday.  The 1cm of snow that fell overnight Friday did not 
; worry the feline duo.
; 
; My day was busy with work and shopping.  Tomorrow should be less 
; busy.  The next FOTD is due in 24 hours.  Wait for it with bated 
; but not abated breath.  Until then, take much care, and I have 
; nothing against fine art, but I think fractals should be consid-
; ered wonders of nature rather than products of human artistic 
; aspiration.
; 
; I'll show the world a great piece of 'fractal fine-art' the day 
; after someone shows me a great 'paint by numbers' fine-art oil 
; painting.
