; FOTD -- December 22, 2008 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things were very busy here at Fractal Central on Sunday, as we 
; finished the decorations and FL started planning the dreaded 
; holiday feast.  All this frenzied activity left almost no time 
; for a proper fractal, but I did manage to find one slow image, 
; which I let calculate while I tried to get the treetop ornament 
; properly straightened.
; 
; I named the image "Long Time No See" because it takes 15 minutes 
; to run, and when it is finished, there is little to look at.  
; Since the image was given almost no effort, I gave it no rating.
; 
; Though the image may be seen by runnung the included parameter 
; file, by far the best way to view it is to surf out to the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view it there, wondering what all the excitement is about.
; 
; Overnight snow Saturday added up to about 2cm here at Fractal 
; Central.  The snow ended on Sunday morning, and by noon the sun 
; appeared.  The fractal cats fully appreciated the brilliant 
; afternoon sun and temperature of 37F 3C.  But late in the day a 
; high wind arose, quickly dropping the temperature to freezing 
; and sending the cats scurrying for the heat.
; 
; My day was spent in holiday preparations and discussing the idea 
; of a business web site with FL, who thinks such a site would be 
; profitable.  (IMO we have enough work as it is.)  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and search 
; for the true meaning of the season.
