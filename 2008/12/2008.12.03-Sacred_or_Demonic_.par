; FOTD -- December 04, 2008 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; NEW FORMULA ALERT!  Today's image was created with a new form-
; ula, posted today for the first time -- the DivideBrot6.  The 
; new formula is a generalization of the DivideBrot5 formula, with 
; the added ability to change the bailout radius to any value and 
; also change the hard-coded Z^2 of the Dividebrot5 formula to any 
; exponent of Z.  But the new formula runs about 1/3 slower.
; 
; Today's image is named "Sacred or Demonic?".  This name refers 
; to the orientation of the 5-pointed star surrounding the quintic 
; minibrot at the center.  When such a five-pointed-star figure is 
; oriented with a point directed straight up, it forms the star of 
; Christmas, which symbolizes the sacred coming of salvation.  But 
; when this figure is rotated a mere 36 degrees so that a point is 
; directed straight down, it forms the satanic pentagram, represen-
; ting a goat's head, with horns, ears and goatee, symbolic of the 
; evil one himself.  Since the star in today's image is oriented 
; halfway between the sacred and profane positions, its meaning is 
; ambiguous, open to any interpretation one wishes to give it.
; 
; The image is located on the main spike of the parent fractal, 
; which is a confusing cross between a Mandelbrot set and the 
; order-5 Mandeloid.  This spike holds both order-5 Mandeloids and 
; Julia-like figure-8 shaped holes, with today's image being 
; located in a valley of a figure-8 hole.
; 
; I rated the image at 7.5.  The coloring might have been improved 
; if I had worked at it a bit longer, but it is good enough as it 
; stands.
; 
; The magnitude of over 2*10^12 requires the mathtolerance entry 
; to assure that the image is calculated at the correct magnitude.
; 
; The fast calculation time of 2 minutes makes the job of running 
; the included parameter file almost a pleasure.  But the trip to 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to view the already-calculated image is a lot more fun.
; 
; Total sun and a temperature of 43F 6C here at Fractal central on 
; Wednesday equals contented fractal cats.  If we forget the non-
; fractal work, my day was acceptable.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and search for the 
; perfect fractal.
