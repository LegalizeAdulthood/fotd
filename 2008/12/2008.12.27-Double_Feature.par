; FOTD -- December 27, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates an 8, which means I like it quite a bit with 
; its almost layered look.  I have nothing against fractals that 
; appear to have several layers as long as the layers are part of 
; a single fractal, as today's layers are.
; 
; The scene lies in a bit of debris between the two branches of 
; the Seahorse Valley of a Mandelbrot set that has been rotated 
; 180 degrees and is starting to morph into a Z^(6)+C Mandeloid.
; 
; Most of the image consists of inside stuff made visible by the 
; bof61 inside fill.  Since there are two nearly identical mini-
; brots in the image, I named it "Double Feature".  I was thinking 
; of the old Saturday afternoon matinees at the movies, where an 
; action-oriented youngster could see two third-rate cowboy movies 
; for the price of one.
; 
; The calculation time of 11-3/4 minutes is slower than I would 
; have liked, but still well within reason.  Those with a 
; different definition of reason may view the finished image on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; One of this year's presents was a new-age book about spiritual 
; reality.  As I was browsing through it Thursday evening, FL 
; innocently asked me if I considered myself a materialist.  She 
; knows better than to ask such questions, because this kind of 
; stuff always causes me to start pondering, and she gets more 
; reply than she expected.
; 
; "Materialists consider the material world to be the ultimate 
; reality,", I began.  "But I'm not even sure that such a thing as 
; an ultimate reality exists, much less that the material world is 
; real.  All I experience are ever-changing images in my aware-
; ness.  Rational people claim but cannot prove that these images 
; correspond to something that is really out there, whatever 'out 
; there' means."
; 
; I finally settled the discussion by declaring that, in my 
; opinion, the material world is every bit as real as a fractal, 
; no more and no less.  An unobserved material object is in the 
; same state that the Mandelbrot set was in before it was discov-
; ered.  I guess this makes me an idealist type of a materialist.
; 
; After an ice-storm on Wednesday and a pleasant Christmas, clouds 
; and sun mixed together here at Fractal Central on Friday to 
; produce a perfectly average winter day, with a temperature of 
; 36F 2C.  The fractal cats enjoyed the sun and tried to ignore 
; the clouds.  My day was occupied by trying to break in a new 
; king-size coffee mug.  The next FOTD will likely appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and when reality turns bad, make 
; imagination real.
