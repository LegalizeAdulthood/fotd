; FOTD -- December 18, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a Mandelbrot set.  The name "The Mandelbrot 
; Set" is a little confusing.  To begin, there is not one 
; Mandelbrot set, but an infinity of them.  The Mandelbrot shape 
; is kind of a universal shape, much like the parabolic shapes 
; that appear so often when the graphs of functions are plotted.
; 
; Actually, the scene shows a tiny minibrot just east of the large 
; Minibrot on the main negative spike of the Mandeloid that 
; results when the familiar M-set just starts changing into the 
; Z^(-2) Mandeloid.  At this early stage of the changeover, only a 
; few extra rings around the original M-set are obvious.
; 
; Most of the effect of the image is a result of rendering it with 
; the outside set to 'summ'.  The apparent X-axis symmetry is an 
; illusion.  A close look will reveal that no symmetry exists.
; 
; If I had more time to work on the colors, the image might have 
; rated a 7.  As it is, the predominant theme of orange and green 
; is rather unattractive, holding the rating to a 6.
; 
; The calculation time of a fireball 50 seconds makes up for the 
; less-than-great colors.  And the finished image is posted for 
; instant viewing on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Two centimeters of snow overnight Tuesday changed to rain at 
; daybreak Wednesday here at Fractal Central.  By midday, the 
; temperature had reached 37F 3C, and the snow was gone, making 
; the fractal cats happier.  But the cats' main interest was 
; watching the squirrels, which were unusually active gathering 
; nuts all day.  Maybe the squirrels know something about the 
; coming weather that the weather people don't.  We'll keep our 
; eye on things for the next several days.
; 
; My day was very busy, making for another hasty FOTD.  The next 
; in the apparently endless series of FOTD fractals will be posted 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and check for reason.
