; FOTD -- December 01, 2008 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I sometimes receive e-mails asking how I find the fractals I 
; post in the FOTD.  I wish the question were not so difficult to 
; answer.  In a recent posting to the Fractint List, Mike actually 
; had it right when he said I must have developed an intuition for 
; fractals, and the ease with which I find them causes me to under-
; rate them.  When searching for fractals, I simply get a feeling 
; that a particular set of parameters or a particular spot in a 
; certain parent fractal will yield something worth the effort.  
; And as often as not I am right.
; 
; Even more surprising, at least to me, is the fact that I some-
; times have little idea of the connection of the math to the 
; shape of the fractal.  This is quite the case in the images I 
; make with formulas like the HyperMandelbrot2, where I can see no 
; connection at all between the infinitesimal parameters I enter 
; and the images that appear on the screen.
; 
; When I was considering today's image, I had an instinctive 
; feeling that the Julia aspect of yesterday's image might hold 
; something interesting.  As today's FOTD shows, I was right.  The 
; unexpected result, which is due entirely to the coloring, is 
; quite striking, even though it hardly looks like a fractal.
; 
; I named the image "Julia Surprise".  After all, that's what it 
; was to me.  The rating of a 9-1/2 is exceptionally high.  It 
; includes 1/2 point for my serendipitous coloring, but still 
; leaves room for improvement.  The coloring took less effort than 
; one would expect.  Actually, I colored the image with a single 
; strike of the <enter> key and one ot two register tweaks.
; 
; The image is a ghostly one.  It is not evaporated, since it 
; started with nothing to be evaporated.  Regardless, the 'bof60' 
; inside fill once again worked its magic on a blank screen, and 
; today's image is the result.
; 
; The other inside fills work with much less success, with the 
; 'bof61' being the best of the lot.  I think the 'bof60' fill 
; colors the bands according to how close the trapped points come 
; to the origin in their limited wanderings, while the 'bof61' 
; fill colors the bands according to which iteration brings the 
; points closest to the origin.
; 
; Perhaps the best feature of today's image is its faster-than-
; light calculation time of 8 swift seconds.  This speed will give 
; no one reason for impatience.  But those with over-qualified 
; machines that panic and freeze when booted with a DOS program 
; will still need to view the finished image on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Sunday began with sleet here at Fractal Central, but by noon 
; the sleet had changed to a cold rain that, together with a 
; temperature of 34F +1C, made the day quite unpleasant.  The 
; fractal cats divided their time between searching for the 
; warmest places they could find, chasing each other up and down 
; the 40-foot (12-meter)-long hallway, and asking for food.
; 
; My day was spent doing little of value.  (Except for the fractal 
; fun.)  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and when things go wrong, shift the aspect of your 
; attitude from the Mandelbrot to the Julia.
