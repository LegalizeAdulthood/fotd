; FOTD -- December 07, 2008 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD fractal image is late because I somehow let myself 
; get dragged into a shopping trip on Saturday.  IMO, wandering 
; aimlessly through one store after another is one of the most 
; boring activities ever devised by the mind of man.  Luckily, I 
; managed to find an electronics store and a book store in which 
; to pass the time, while FL spent several hours browsing through 
; totally useless places such as clothing outlets and trendy gift 
; stores -- (the kind with scented candles and teddy bears).  If 
; the snow had not started, we might still be there.
; 
; By the time the snow set in, I had wasted so much time that 
; there was little time available for fractals.  But I still found 
; one that rates good enough to be honored as FOTD for December 7.
; 
; The parent fractal combines various negative portions of 
; Z^(-1.44) and Z^(-7.75).  This parent consists of the usual 
; string of circular bays with a prominent 'fan' extending east 
; from the origin.  (There is also a very large disconnected 
; 'circle' some distance to the northeast, but this circle does 
; not figure in the main part of the parent fractal.)
; 
; Today's scene is located in a tiny disconnected dot of activity 
; near the edge of the 'fan'.  I named the image "Skeletal 
; Remains" because when I finished the coloring, little of the 
; original scene was left but its skeletal outline.
; 
; The basic fractal itself rates about a 6.  The rating of 7-1/2 
; includes a 1-1/2 point reward for the coloring, which is what 
; makes the entire image.  Without the skeletal effect, the image 
; would be just another throw-away.
; 
; The calculation time of 49 seconds is lightning fast, as fast as 
; a trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to view the finished image there.
; 
; The morning sun disappeared by midday here at Fractal Central on 
; Saturday.  The cloudy afternoon that followed turned into light 
; snow by 4pm, much to the annoyance of the fractal cats, who were 
; left alone all afternoon.  And the temperature of 16F -9C didn't 
; help at all.  My day was, well, how good can a day of boredom 
; be?  The next hopefully glorious FOTD will be posted in about 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and be patient.
