; FOTD -- July 04, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In a recent letter to the Fractint list, JoTz noticed that the 
; parent fractal of the "Order Septemdecem" FOTD image, which 
; resembles a Mandelbrot set and was posted on June 27, has a bit 
; of unexpected detail in its interior.  I have known about this 
; extra stuff since I started working on the DivideBrot formulas.  
; The extra detail in the parent of the septemdecem fractal is 
; actually the fragmentary remains of a Z^17+C Mandeloid, which 
; appears when the imag(p1) parameter is set very close to but not 
; exactly at zero.  (I usually use the number 0.0000000001 instead 
; of zero.  In this case, the exponential form [1e-010] inserted 
; in the formula does not work.  This will be corrected in version 
; number 5.)
; 
; When imag(p1) is set to virtually zero, the resulting fractal is 
; the normal Z^17+C Mandeloid.  But as imag(p1) is increased, this 
; Mandeloid gradually grows in size and morphs into the tradition-
; al Mandelbrot set, leaving order-17 debris to dissolve in the 
; interior of the forming M-set.  Some of the intermediate steps 
; are quite interesting, but due to the size change, an animation 
; with consistently sized elements would be difficult.
; 
; The basic rule is: the smaller the value of imag(p1) the smaller 
; the size of the resulting fractal and the more prominent the 
; higher order shape, while at the same time, the greater the 
; value of imag(p1) the larger the size of the resulting fractal 
; and the more prominent the classic Mandelbrot-set shape.
; 
; Today's scene takes advantage of the dissolving high-order 
; debris in the center of the main bay of the parent 'almost-a-
; Mandelbrot set'.  The scene is located in what first appears as 
; a tiny dot, but when blown up reveals itself as an entire 
; fractal universe.
; 
; Due to the unusually large magnitude of the image, an outzoom 
; to the parent fractal is quite a trip, but very interesting.  
; But be sure to turn off the logmap feature before taking the 
; backwards trip.
; 
; BTW, the DivideBrot4 formula will soon be superseded by the 
; DivideBrot5 formula, which will be used for all future fractals 
; of today's type.
; 
; I rated today's image, which shows an unusually well-defined 
; cubic minibrot, at an 8.  It's worth it.  I named it "Perfectly 
; Cubic" for the same reason.
; 
; The calculation time of 47 seconds will cause no pain to those 
; with computers that are not over-qualified.  Those with machines 
; that can surf the web in a flash but cannot run Fractint may 
; still see the image by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and enjoying there the image that Paul calculated.
; 
; Lots of clouds, only a little sunshine, high humidity, a tempera-
; ture of 84F 29C, and a threat of rain followed by actual rain, 
; made Thursday less than ideal here at Fractal Central.  Not 
; concerned with weather, the fractal cats spent a good part of 
; the day trying to catch a fly.  When one of them eventually 
; caught it, the exhausted duo settled down to sleep.
; 
; My day was busy, mostly because tomorrow is a holiday.  The FOTD 
; does not take time off for holidays however, and will be posted 
; on schedule in 24 hours.
