; FOTD -- July 29, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we return to the DivideBrot5 formula to check a fractal 
; that is quadratic on the surface, but of order-7 in its depths.  
; This oversized fractal at first appears to be a Mandelbrot set 
; blown up like a balloon, but it is totally different once one 
; wanders beneath its deceiving surface.
; 
; At first the quadratic minibrots appear merely distorted, as 
; though they were not critical, but they soon evolve into perfect 
; order-7 minibrots, with far more interesting detail surrounding 
; them than could ever be found in the simple Z^7+C Mandeloid.
; 
; Today's surprisingly rich minibrot is located near a minor bud 
; on the northwest shore line of the main bay of the parent near-
; Mandelbrot set.  I especially enjoy the awkward way the 7 arms 
; radiating from the minibrot merge into the quadratic pattern a 
; little farther out.  An outzoom will reveal more detail of this 
; merge area.
; 
; I named the image "Frankenberries".  I think I did it because 
; the wine-colored basins remind me of the color of rasperry 
; ice-cream, which strangely enough I have a sudden urge for.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is about FOTD average.  The calculation time 
; of 2-1/3 minutes can be eliminated by surfing to the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and enjoying the already-completed GIF image there.
; 
; The weather report, back by popular demand, for Monday at 
; Fractal Central in central Pennsylvania is one of typical 
; midsummer conditions -- partly cloudy skies, a temperature of 
; 86F 30C and contented fractal cats.  The cats are contented 
; because the wandering tomcats that had a noisy catfight in the 
; yard a few nights ago have apparently moved on to other 
; territory.
; 
; My Monday was just a little busier than average.  Tuesday will 
; probably be the same.  Early Wednesday the 30th I must take a 
; 140-mile-each-way trip back to Old Fractal Central to arrange to 
; have some repair work done on the old place, but I'll be back to 
; New Fractal Central by Wednesday evening.  As a result, there 
; will most likely be no FOTD for July 31.  The next FOTD, the one 
; for July 30, will be posted in 24 hours or less.  Until then, 
; take care, and maybe what really is, really isn't.
