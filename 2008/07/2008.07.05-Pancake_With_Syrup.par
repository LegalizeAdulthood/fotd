; FOTD -- July 05, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image I introduce the ultimate, final, absolutely 
; last version of the DivideBrot series of formulas -- version 
; number 5.  It draws the same images as version 4, but with two 
; minor changes.
; 
; I have added a value of 0.00000000000000000001, or 10^-20, to 
; the imag(p1) parameter.  This insignificant addition avoids a 
; blank screen when the parameter is set to zero, and has no 
; effect on the calculation time or image.  I have also elimina-
; ted the real(p2) parameter and inserted a hard-coded bailout 
; radius of 1,000,000, which eliminates the need to raise the 
; bailout as the imag(p1) parameter is increased.  The result is a 
; simpler formula with less chances for mistakes.
; 
; I named today's image "Pancake With Syrup".  (The syrup is 
; blueberry flavored.)  I rated it at a 6, which indicates that 
; I do not consider it anything out of the ordinary.
; 
; The magnitude of the image is large enough to make the math-
; tolerance entry necessary.  This assures that the parameter file 
; calculates at the correct magnitude.
; 
; The parent fractal is another almost-Mandelbrot set, with 
; today's image located on a spike on the northeast shoreline of 
; the main bay of the large midget on the negative spike of the 
; parent M-set.  As is true of many almost M-sets, the main bay as 
; well as the buds are filled with tiny bits of debris, which 
; prove to be entire universes when enlarged.
; 
; The calculation time of only 42 seconds exceeds the speed of 
; light, showing that the theory of relativity is flawed.  The 
; completed GIF image is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; While we were relaxing in our lawn chairs this afternoon, FL 
; casually asked me whether I believed in science or religion.  
; Not being in the mood for philosophical rambling, I replied that 
; I believe in both of them, since both science and religion are 
; real.  This reply saved a lot of words, but I'm not sure what I 
; would have said if she had worded the question differently and 
; asked me whether I consider faith or reason to be the the better 
; path to ultimate truth.  The question brought my philosophical 
; muse to life however, so expect some enlightening or not so 
; enlightening words about faith and reason before long.
; 
; Heavy clouds and threatening rain made Friday less than ideal at 
; Fractal Central.  And the temperature of 73F 23C hardly felt 
; like Independence Day, which is usually as hot as a firecracker. 
; But it stayed dry, the neighborhood cookouts were a success, and 
; the fractal cats made the most of the marginal conditions.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and watch for runaway fractals.
