; FOTD -- July 01, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's FOTD we continue the investigation of higher order 
; minibrots in apparent classic Mandelbrot sets.  Today's order-7 
; minibrot was found in the star of a high-order bud rather deep 
; in the East Valley of its parent.
; 
; To add a bit of oomph to an otherwise routine image I rendered 
; it with the outside set to 'tdis', which is really quite useful 
; when no other coloring options seem to work.
; 
; But even with the 'tdis' outside the image rates only a 6.  This 
; is not too bad, but I would like to have a rating a bit higher.  
; I named the image "Feeling Testy", which has nothing to do with 
; my mood.  The words simply came to mind as I studied the scene.
; 
; In comparison with yesterday's image, which calculates in 20 
; seconds, today's image takes almost 9 minutes to finish.  To 
; ease impatience, I recommend going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; Monday turned out quite pleasant here at Fractal Central, with 
; enough sun to keep everyone happy and a temperature of 82F 28C, 
; which was made quite comfortable by the lower humidity.  The 
; fractal cats agreed.  A moderate thunder-shower came up at 9pm 
; to end the day with a bang.
; 
; My day was very average.  I only hope tomorrow can be the same.  
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and if you know it and know that you know it, then you know it 
; is true.
