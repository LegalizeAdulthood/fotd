; FOTD -- July 15, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I spent most of the time on today's philosophy, which appears 
; below, so I have little time for the fractal discussion.
; 
; Today's image is from the same parent fractal as yesterday's 
; image.  This parent was created by combining 0.4 part of (1/Z) 
; with Z^100 and adding C.
; 
; Whereas yesterday's image is located on the west side of the 
; open area of its parent, today's is found in a vestigial East 
; Valley on the East side.
; 
; I named the image "Hyper Ultra Hyper", which means nothing.  I 
; rated it at a 6, which is a half step down from yesterday's 
; image.
; 
; The calculation time of one minute will bring only happiness.  
; And that happiness may be assured by visiting the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished GIF image there.
; 
; Out of the blue Monday afternoon, FL made one of her comments 
; that are intended to be innocent, but really get me pondering.  
; She commented that she thinks I might be losing faith in 
; science.
; 
; How insightful a statement!  Science is supposed to work in 
; exactly the opposite way from faith.  The claims of science must 
; be objectively provable and falsifiable, while faith is based on 
; unverifiable and unfalsifiable doctrines stated by priests, plus 
; lots of hope, and yes, a bit of wishful thinking.
; 
; When one loses faith, it means that the person can no longer 
; believe a particular religious doctrine.  A person may lose 
; faith in the existence of a supernatural creator God because so 
; much of the universe has been shown to have a perfectly natural 
; explanation.  They may lose faith in the existence of an immor-
; tal soul because the conscious mind is known to be intimately 
; connected with a healthy functioning brain.  Or the person may 
; simply be unable to believe in things he cannot observe.
; 
; But at the same time, science also requires us to have faith in 
; things that we cannot observe.  No one has ever directly seen 
; an atom or any of the sub-atomic particles.  We see only the 
; written scriptures of physicists serving as high priests, who 
; claim to have observed some high-energy phenomena that only they 
; can interpret for us.
; 
; We have the words of the religious priests written in the holy 
; scriptures of religion; we have the words of the physicist 
; priests written in the holy scriptures of published scientific 
; papers.  We have apologists for religion; we have apologists for 
; science.  The religious faithful are quick to defend their 
; religious beliefs; the scientific faithful are just as quick to 
; defend their scientific beliefs.  I see little difference.
; 
; In my case, my greatest doubt is that it is possible for a 
; theory of everything to even exist, much less be worked out 
; mathematically.  Not the least problem is that the concept of 
; 'everything' is an unrealizable ideal, not an objective reality. 
; Finding a theory of everything is as likely as finding every 
; possible fractal.  Physicists have been chasing a chimera for 
; over a century.
; 
; But the chase is fun, and the chasers get their books published, 
; and their shows fill the television channels, so the futile 
; chase will likely continue well into the 22nd Century.
; 
; But even then, the number of calculated fractals will have yet 
; to scratch the surface of the total number of fractals that 
; potentially exist.
; 
; Monday opened with clouds here at Fractal Central, but by late 
; morning the clouds had cleared away, leading to one of the most 
; delightful afternoons of the summer.  The fractal cats were too 
; busy watching a tailless cat hanging around the area to bother 
; with the 84F 29C weather.
; 
; In my department, the real work was finished early, leaving 
; ample time for today's image, which, despite sufficient time, 
; still fell short.  The next FOTD image will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and keep the faith.
