; FOTD -- July 06, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD takes us to an overblown Mandelbrot set contamina-
; ted with remnant Z^49+C debris.  The scene is located on the 
; west-northwest shore of the main bud of the M-set, rather deep 
; in Scepter Valley.
; 
; The more I use the DivideBrot5 formula, which is an unusually 
; simple one, the more I find in it.  As today's image shows, it 
; can change those normally hopeless high-order minibrots into 
; 'brots with recognizable quadratic and other types of patterns 
; around them.
; 
; Today's minibrot consists of 48 lobes, but don't try to see 
; them.  The image is at the absolute limit of definition, and any 
; further enlargement will cause a breakdown that might serve as 
; a new style of art, but is most unattractive when seen in a 
; fractal.
; 
; When I named the image "It's Stuporfractal", I was thinking of 
; an old Daffy Duck cartoon, where Daffy, as Stuporduck, tries to 
; save the world from the forces of evil.
; 
; The rating of a 7 means the image could have been better but 
; also could have been worse.  The calculation time of under 
; 3-1/2 minutes means relief for the time challenged.  The 
; finished image will also be posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; as soon as Paul can run the parameter file and post it.
; 
; The weather turned unexpectedly pleasant here at Fractal central 
; on Saturday, so FL and I decided to take another day off.  The 
; fractal cats gave no complaints as we filled their dishes and 
; headed for the outdoors.  The only thing to suffer was the FOTD 
; for July 6, which is now almost one day late.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted nearly on time in about 10 hours, so keep close 
; watch on your e-mailbox until then.  Until next time, take care, 
; and when you philosophize about the meaning of existence, be 
; sure to come to a conclusion you can live with.
