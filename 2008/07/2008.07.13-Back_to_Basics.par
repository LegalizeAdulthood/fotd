; FOTD -- July 13, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's modest effort takes us back to the warhorse formula, the 
; MandAutoCritInZ.  I was away from this formula for so long that 
; I almost forgot how it works.  After a few minutes trial and 
; error however, my memory was refreshed, and I found today's 
; image in the fractal that results when various negative portions 
; of Z^(-1.6) and Z^(-6) are combined and (1/C) is added.
; 
; The parent fractal is a string of four large north-south 
; oriented bays, with today's image located just inland from the 
; western shoreline of the southernmost bay -- the bay with the 
; shoreline that most closely resembles the shoreline of the M-set.
; 
; The scene lies in a field of scattered and disconnected debris.  
; The character of this debris is reflected in the patterns of 
; today's image.
; 
; I named the image "Back to Basics" because it is a return to the 
; basic workhorse formula.  I rated it at a 6 because I think it's 
; worth no more.
; 
; The calculation time of 20 seconds is blessedly brief, as is the 
; trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to view the pre-calculated image there.  But due to the unusual 
; hour of this posting, give Paul a chance to get the image up.
; 
; Saturday here at Fractal Central was on the hot side, but the 
; temperature of 91F 33C was made bearable by a moderate breeze 
; and humidity that was not too high.  The fractal cats spent much 
; of the afternoon playing with a few japanese beetles that some-
; how got inside.
; 
; After clearing the beetles from FL's roses and giving the plants 
; a good spraying, I had an acceptable day.  The next FOTD, good 
; or bad, will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; if the world is not really out there, then where is it?
