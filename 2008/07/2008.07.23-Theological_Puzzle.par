; FOTD -- July 23, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's image we return to the formula that has supplied 
; more FOTD fractals than any other -- the MandAutoCritInZ 
; formula.  We check the fractal that results when 1.5 negative 
; parts of Z^(-5.5) are combined with 1.3 negative parts of 
; Z^(-1.3) and (1/C) is added.
; 
; The parent fractal reminds me of a large ant complete with head, 
; thorax and abdomen, crawling southward across the screen.  
; Today's image is located in the east branch of the valley where 
; the thorax meets the abdomen.
; 
; When I named the image, I was pondering one of the unanswerable 
; theological questions that I once pestered my religion teachers 
; with -- why does an all-good, all-knowing and all-powerful god 
; permit bad things to happen to good people.  This explains the 
; name I gave the image --"Theological Puzzle".
; 
; I really should curb my theological pondering.  It constantly 
; gets me into trouble.  God, whatever truth lies behind that 
; idea, must lack at least one, and possibly all of these attri-
; butes.  Perhaps God is not all-good.  After all, goodness is a 
; human concept, and why should God's idea of ultimate good be the 
; same as ours?  Or perhaps God is not all-knowing.  Could even a 
; god know absolutely everything, which by definition must include 
; what every sub-atomic particle in the universe has ever done, is 
; now doing, and ever will do -- things that by their nature are 
; unknowable?  Or perhaps God is not all-powerful.  Could even an 
; all-powerful god do something that is impossible, such as making 
; 2 plus 2 equal 7?
; 
; Of course, theology is not the only discipline with unanswerable 
; questions.  Check one of the popularized science books about cos-
; mology or quantum theory, or grab one of those currently trendy 
; books about new-age mysticism.  As I often say, 'we don't know 
; what we don't know'.
; 
; And to make matters worse, I don't even have the option of avoid-
; ing the theological question by trying to convince myself that 
; God does not exist and then claiming to be an Atheist.
; 
; Now that I have indulged myself in this theological diversion, 
; it's time to get back to the fractal business at hand.  I rated 
; today's image at a 6, which is all I think it is worth.  The cal-
; culation time of under 3 minutes will not be much of a problem.  
; The finished image is also posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A light midday shower did not spoil the otherwise near-perfect 
; midsummer weather on Tuesday here at Fractal Central.  The high 
; temperature of 86F 30C and lower humidity were great for 
; everything but snowmen.  The fractal cats imagined themselves 
; tigers as they watched a chipmunk in the back yard grass.
; 
; My day was average, which means nothing happened.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and ponder 
; the hard questions.
