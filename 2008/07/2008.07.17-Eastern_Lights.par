; FOTD -- July 17, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Due to an excess amount of real work, the fun work of fractals 
; was cut short on Wednesday.  But I did find time to delve into 
; the parent fractal that results when the formula Z^(1.875)+C is 
; calculated 36 levels up the logarithmic ladder with the 'floor' 
; function in effect.
; 
; This parent fractal resembles a Mandelbrot set that has been 
; put through a wringer.  Its most interesting feature is a much 
; smaller distorted Mandelbrot set just to the east of the main 
; set.  Today's image is located in the East Valley area of this 
; mini-M-set, which curiously lies on the mini's west side.
; 
; There is not much more to be said about the image, though there 
; is much to be seen when viewing it.
; 
; I named the image "Eastern Lights" because it's on the eastern 
; side of its parent, and rated it at a 7 because that's what I 
; think it's worth.
; 
; The calculation time of a nominal 2-1/2 minutes may be avoided 
; by viewing the finished fractal on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With added haze, higher humidity and a temperature of 88F 31C, 
; Wednesday was a comedown from the previous day here at Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal-cat duo showed their displeasure by 
; camping most of the day under the cool-air vent.
; 
; My day was busier than I would have preferred.  With any luck at 
; all however, tomorrow, when the next FOTD will ne posted, will 
; be an improvement.  Until then, take care, and speak softly with 
; nature.  I hear that, at its smallest scale, it may well be a 
; fractal.
