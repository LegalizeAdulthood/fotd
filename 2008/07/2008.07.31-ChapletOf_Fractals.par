; FOTD -- July 31, 2008 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yes, I know I said there would be no FOTD for July 31, but the 
; repair work at Old Fractal Central went astonishingly fast this 
; morning, and by 11am I was on my way back to New Fractal Cen-
; tral.  The only downer was Thomas, the one remaining old fractal 
; cat.  My sister said he has been very depressed since his 
; brother Tippy passed on to cat heaven about 5 months ago.  I 
; tried to cheer him, and he did raise his head and murmur a few 
; small purrs when he saw me, but then he rolled over, curled up 
; and returned to sleep, where he likely is still with Tippy.
; 
; Today's image shows an order-7 minibrot lurking in an almost-
; Mandelbrot set.  The scene is located on the northwest shoreline 
; of the bud immediately west of the large period-2? bud of its 
; parent fractal.  I never realized these higher-order minibrots 
; could be so interesting.
; 
; I rated the image, perhaps a bit liberally, at a 6.5.  I named 
; it "Chaplet of Fractals" when I noticed the ring of blossom-like 
; elements surrounding the central minibrot, each blossom with a 
; still smaller minibrot at its center.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-4/5 minutes is worth the wait.  And 
; equally worthwhile is a trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to view the finished product there.
; 
; Hot muggy conditions prevailed Wednesday morning at Old Fractal 
; Central, while the conditions at New Fractal Central in the aft-
; ernoon were noticeably better.  The temperature ranged from 95F 
; 35C at O.F.C. to 88F 31C at N.F.C.  The fractal cats greeted me 
; reservedly when I arrived back at New Fractal Central unexpected-
; ly early, with enough time remaining in the day to crank out an 
; unexpected FOTD.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take much 
; care, and search for good fractals.
