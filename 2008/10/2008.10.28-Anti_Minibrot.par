; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- October 29, 2008 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's rare that I stumble upon something entirely new in the 
; world of fractals, but today it appears to have happened.
; 
; I named today's image "Anti-Minibrot" because that's what it is. 
; The image is exactly the opposite of a minibrot.  Instead of 
; growing larger as the center of symmetry is approached, the 
; iteration count grows smaller.  And instead of the expected 
; 2...4...8... sequence of symmetry as we near the center, we have 
; an 8...4...2... sequence.  The backwardness is immediately 
; noticeable in the reverse direction of the color cycling.  
; Instead of visualizing today's image as the expected bottomless 
; pit of a minibrot, we must see it as a mountain peak.
; 
; The rating of an 8-1/2 reflects the mathematical interest of the 
; image and includes 1/2 point for my coloring effort.  Its 
; artistic worth alone is closer to a humdrum 5.
; 
; I have not yet had a chance to open my P4-2000mhz machine 
; dedicated to fractals to see why it will not start, so today's 
; image was created on the P200 unit with the broken exhaust fan, 
; which served the fractal world faithfully for over 10 years.  
; The 4-1/2 minute calculation time on the older machine would be 
; closer to 1-1/2 minutes on the 200mhz unit.
; 
; However, calculation time is of no consequence for those who 
; view the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Cloudy skies, cold rain with a few wet snowflakes mixed in, high 
; winds with gusts to 50mph 80kph, and a temperature of 41F 5C 
; allowed the fractal cats only brief periods of comfort on their 
; TV seats in the side window.  They complained, but were silenced 
; by several treats of half-and-half coffee creamer.
; 
; My day was appropriately busy.  The next FOTD will be posted in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if nothing is real, then 
; everything is an illusion.  Since I am included in the set of 
; everything, what is having the illusion that I exist?
