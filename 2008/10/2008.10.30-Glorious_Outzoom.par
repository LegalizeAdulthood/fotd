; FOTD -- October 30, 2008 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is an outzoom from yesterday's image.  It's not 
; exactly glorious, but I felt like exaggerating when I chose the 
; name, so I named it "Glorious Outzoom".  The rating of a 7-1/2 
; includes 1/2 point for my extra coloring effort.  Coloring in 
; GIF mode takes effort.  It's not easy to get smooth colors with 
; only 256 colors to choose from.
; 
; The purplish spot just southwest of the minibrot at the center 
; of today's image is the source of the break in the smooth 
; sequence of bifurcating features surrounding the minibrot, which 
; itself has been caught in the act of shifting from quadratic to 
; cubic.  This purplish spot is in fact yesterday's anti-minibrot 
; image.
; 
; Today's minibrot itself resembles one of order 2.718 but lacks 
; the discontinuities that I always thought 'must' exist in such 
; fractals.  I have not yet figured out what is happening, but 
; whatever it is, it sure is interesting.  (And since the universe 
; is a giant fractal, and keeps breaking the rules that seem so 
; intuitive to us, why should it be surprising to see our small-
; scale fractals doing the same?)
; 
; Since my 2000mhz fractal machine is still out of action, and 
; will remain so until I find the time and energy to tackle it, 
; today's image was run on the ancient but faithful 200mhz unit.  
; On the old unit it takes 4-1/2 minutes to finish.  On the ailing 
; 2000mhz machine, it would finish in about 1-1/4 minutes.
; 
; But why worry about calculation time when the completed image is 
; or soon will be posted for instant enjoyment on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; What a minor let down!  Gerald D. has informed me that 
; yesterday's 'anti-minibrot' is actually an example of 'reverse 
; bifurcation', which I assume is relatively rare, but not totally 
; unknown.  And a further examination of yesterday's image has 
; shown that in this image at least, the symmetry totally vanishes 
; beyond the stage of 2-part symmetry.  (Then again, what else 
; could it do?)
; 
; In yesterday's trivial closing comment, I speculated that every-
; thing is an illusion, and wondered what then is having the very 
; convincing illusion that I myself exist.  Alex Dukay replied 
; that in his opinion it is the conscious mind that creates the 
; illusion of an individual identity.  Now I wonder what is having 
; the illusion that the conscious mind exists.  (The logic seems 
; to be going in circles here, but the flaw is hard to pin down.)
; 
; Chilly temperatures around 39F 4C, mostly cloudy skies, and 
; occasional showers of cold rain and wet snow made Wednesday less 
; than perfect here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats agreed 
; and wasted little time hunched on their shelf by the drafty 
; window, watching the TV show outside.
; 
; My day was about average, which still leaves some things to be 
; desired.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and prosper.
