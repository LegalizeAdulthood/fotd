; FOTD -- October 06, 2008 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The minibrot at the center of today's image looks like an 
; ordinary quadratic one.  But do not be deceived by appearances.  
; It is actually a minibrot of order 1.95, basically indistinguish-
; able from a quadratic minibrot.  The parent fractal appears to 
; be an oversized Mandelbrot set, but some minor differences along 
; the negative X-axis spoil its perfection.  Today's image lies in 
; one of these differences.
; 
; The image is located in an almost totally swallowed up scepter, 
; its remains barely peeking out from a discontinuity.  I named it 
; "Kaleidoscope Color" when I remembered how, as a child, I spent 
; hours gazing into one of those toy kaleidoscopes, watching the 
; broken bits of colored glass create ever-changing 6-sided 
; patterns.
; 
; I rated the image at a 6.5, giving myself a half-point bonus for 
; the work I put into the coloring.  Had I put a little more work 
; into the colors, I might have been able to rate the image at a 7.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes is within reason.  Viewing 
; the completed image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; is also quite reasonable.
; 
; The trip back to Old Fractal Central on Saturday was uneventful. 
; But curiously enough, even though I moved away 2-1/2 years ago 
; and only one of the old fractal cats is still alive, it still 
; seems like I'm returning home from a vacation trip.
; 
; The Saturday weather at New Fractal Central was miserable -- 
; cloudy with light rain and a temperature of 54F 12C, while at 
; Old Fractal Central it was sunny and 72F 22C.  Sunday here at 
; New Fractal Central was mostly sunny and quite pleasant, with a 
; temperature of 64F 18C.  The one remaining old fractal cat, 
; Thomas, slept through the fine weather on Saturday.  The two new 
; fractal cats, Nicholas and Cassandra, stood watch in the window 
; most of Sunday, making sure no unwanted cats intruded into the 
; yard.
; 
; I simply took both days as easy as possible, which is not too 
; easy on a day with a 300-mile round trip included.  The next 
; FOTD, undoubtedly glorious, will be posted in an incredibly 
; brief 24 hours.  Until then, take care, but leave a little room 
; for fun.
