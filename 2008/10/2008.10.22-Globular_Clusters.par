; FOTD -- October 22, 2008 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Another hyper-busy day here at F.C. means another abbreviated 
; discussion.  Suffice it to say that today's image lies in an 
; evaporated fractal.  What is seen on the screen is nothing but 
; empty 'inside' stuff made visible by the 'bof60' inside fill.  
; (The image is actually a zoom into yesterday's image.)
; 
; Today's image reminds me of a deep-sky photograph, perhaps taken 
; by the now broken-down Hubble Space Telescope.  The object at 
; the center so closely resembles a globular cluster surrounded by 
; smaller clusters that I named the image "Globular Clusters".
; 
; I could not rate the image, which I found almost automatically.  
; But I feel that running the 10-minute parameter file will result 
; at least in fractal satisfaction, even if it does not rescue the 
; economy.
; 
; To enjoy the image without trying to rescue the economy, view it 
; in finished form on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A mostly cloudy, blustery autumn day prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central on Tuesday, with occasional showers of falling and 
; drifting leaves keeping the fractal cats occupied.  The tempera-
; ture of 55F 13C was not too chilly, but in the wind it was 
; unpleasant.
; 
; My day was very busy, with a repeat expected tomorrow.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  The only question is whether a 
; discussion will accompany it.  Until then, take care, and 3.5 
; billion years of geologic time can accomplish the miracle of 
; creating life and eventually intelligent human beings by pure 
; chance. . . or can it?
