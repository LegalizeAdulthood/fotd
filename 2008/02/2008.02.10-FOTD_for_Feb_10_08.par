; FOTD -- February 10, 2008 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Due to an unexpected rush job on Saturday, today's FOTD is late. 
; It's the same job that came in rather unexpectedly last February 
; and caused me to miss about 2 week's FOTD's.  Luckily, this 
; year the job is much smaller.
; 
; In a pinch on Saturday, I tracked down a miniscule minibrot on a 
; filament of a larger minibrot on a filament extending northwest 
; from the next bud beyond the large period-2 bud on the main 
; spike of the Mandelbrot set.  At the magnitude of today's image, 
; the minibrot itself is still far beyond sight, but I have been 
; down there and can report that it is a rather routine one, sur-
; rounded by a basin of attraction that consists of little more 
; than fancy circles.  Most of the action lies much farther out in 
; the magnitude range of today's image.
; 
; Since the image more or less found itself, I gave it neither a 
; name nor a rating.  And the calculation time is a rather slow 
; 18 minutes.  But to save calculation time I have sent the comple-
; ted image on ahead to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it will soon be posted for real-time viewing.
; 
; Saturday proved rather unpleasant here at Fractal Central, with 
; cloudy skies, a temperature just above freezing, and about 2 
; inches, 5cm, of wet sloppy snow.  The inclement day ended with 
; lightning and thunder.  As the fractal cats watched the action, 
; they were glad to be inside.  I was glad to be inside also, 
; though I will be even more glad when the work is wrapped up.  If 
; all goes well, this will be Sunday evening.  The next FOTD will 
; hopefully be ready in 24 hours. Until then, take care, and keep 
; hopping and hoping.
