; FOTD -- February 02, 2008 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Unless I have an operational time machine hidden in the garage, 
; the year it was 24 hours ago is, always was, and always will be 
; 2008.  But old habits are like old fractals.  They die hard.
; 
; Today's image takes us to a bud on the north shore of HyperEast 
; Valley.  I named the image Deep HyperRadical because it sits 
; deep in the interior of the bud, and buds, along with their 
; associated elements, are sometimes called radicals.  This parti-
; cular bud is a very tiny one with a very high periodicity, which 
; lies comfortably between much larger buds of much lesser periodi-
; city.  I have no idea why today's image, which lies inside this 
; tiny bud, should appear to have a cycle of 6.
; 
; Yes, there are more unusual scenes of varying cycles lying as 
; deep as it is possible to go into the center of today's image, 
; and likely extending to infinitesimal infinity.  These scenes 
; are not mere boring fractalish repeats of the top scene.  Each 
; level has a character of its own.
; 
; The maxiter of today's image is an arbitrary choice.  As the 
; maxiter is increased, the open areas with the twisting greenish 
; arms gradually fill in, until ultimately they are filled solid 
; with fractal debris.
; 
; In my opinion, the image rates an honest 9.  It is worthwhile 
; artistically and interesting mathematically.  And its calcula-
; tion time of 3 minutes is not bad either.  Of course, for extra 
; convenience, the finished image is posted on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Absolutely miserable weather prevailed here at Fractal Central 
; on Friday.  The day began with one inch, or 2.5cm, of sleet on 
; the ground.  The sleet changed to freezing rain by 9am, and it 
; rained steadily for the rest of the day, while the temperature 
; slowly rose to above freezing by afternoon, leaving an inch of 
; heavy wet slush everywhere.  The fractal cats watched from the 
; front window shelf as I squeegeed away the sloppy mess by hand.
; 
; The rest of my day was easy enough, though a small but hurried 
; design job is expected tomorrow.  The next FOTD will appear in 
; about 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and is the Mandelbrot 
; set infinite or half infinite?
