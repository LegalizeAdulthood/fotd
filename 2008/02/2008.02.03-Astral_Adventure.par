; FOTD -- February 03, 2008 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Skeptics know that ghosts are not real, though I doubt that the 
; ghosts know it.  Ghosts or no ghosts, today's image is a picture 
; of a bonafide ghost, or what I call a ghost bud.  The perturbed 
; Mandelbrot sets are filled with ghost buds that can be returned 
; to their unperturbed glory by resetting initial Z to 0,0.  But 
; the ghost in today's image cannot be returned to its full glory 
; because I don't know where to find it.  All 4 parts of initial 
; Z, (p1) and (p2), are already set to zero.  Like all ghosts, the 
; one in today's image seems to exist in another world, and only 
; fleeting glimpses of it can be seen in this world.
; 
; The location of today's scene is in the vicinity of East Valley, 
; though some distance offshore, where nothing but trapped inside 
; points should exist.  I named it "Astral Adventure" because the 
; astral plane is where ghosts are supposed to exist.  The actual 
; nature of the astral plane is another topic for another day, but 
; at this time I will say that, though I am a skeptic, I am not a 
; born-again skeptic.  And I hear a lot of talk among theoretical 
; physicists about many, though not necessarily astral, worlds, as 
; well as much rebuttal from the born-again skeptics.
; 
; I would like to have been able to rate the image at an 8 or 9, 
; but I just couldn't find anything in it worth such a rating, so 
; the scene ended up rated at a 7.5.  The parallel comb-like fore-
; ground arms plus my coloting add the extra point.
; 
; The calculation time of 9 minutes is not too much for such an 
; unexpected image.  But if this time is a little inconvenient, 
; convenience may be regained on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the finished image will soon be posted.
; 
; I'm slightly sorry for the lateness of today's image, but I had 
; to make an unscheduled trip to Old Fractal Central on Saturday, 
; and didn't get back to New Fractal Central until near midnight.  
; I can report that the old fractal cats, Thomas and Tippy, are 
; still as lazy as ever.  They actually raised their heads when 
; I walked in.  The new fractal cats, Nicholas and Cassie, stayed 
; here with fractal lady all day, and she says they hardly noticed 
; that I was gone.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in around 12 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and rational thinkers know that ghosts are mere fantasies 
; in the minds of the superstitious, but the ghosts, who have not 
; heard that they are mere fantasies, continue their haunting.
