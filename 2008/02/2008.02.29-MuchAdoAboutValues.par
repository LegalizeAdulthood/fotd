; FOTD -- March 01, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things are still tight here at Fractal Central.  Fractal lady is 
; in the recovery stage, but still out of action, while I do 
; double duty.  And the reason I cannot send e-mail through Mind-
; spring (Earthlink) is because they now require authentication.  
; I'll need to change some settings in my e-mail client, but I 
; have not yet found the time to search for the way to do it.
; 
; In the meantime, today's fractal is a scene in the East Valley 
; of the (-Z)^(2.0000001)+C Mandeloid.  It is just unusual enough 
; to earn a rating of a 7.  The name "Much Ado About Values" can 
; mean whatever the individual FOTD viewer wants it to mean.
; 
; Curiously, in the area of today's image, the inner features of 
; the Z^(2.0000001) and (-Z)^(20000001) Mandeloids are virtually 
; identical, while by contrast, the Z^2.5 and (-Z)^2.5 Mandeloids 
; are entirely different.  
; 
; Today's parameter file calculates in 3-1/4 minutes, about the 
; same time it takes to hustle to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and enjoy instant satisfaction there.
; 
; Morning sun was followed by midday clouds and light afternoon 
; snow here at Fractal Central on Friday.  By FOTD post time about 
; 3/4 inch 2cm had piled up on the fractal sidewalk.  The fractal 
; cats watched with curiosity, then settled by the heat for a long 
; warm nap.
; 
; My day continued very busy, and I see no reason tomorrow will be 
; different.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and work to make it a better world.  You might 
; even do a little good before you find out it's impossible.
