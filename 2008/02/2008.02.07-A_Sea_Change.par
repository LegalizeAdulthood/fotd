; FOTD -- February 07, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD pictures the same scene as yesterday's image, which 
; was kind of split in half.  But what a change the different 
; parameters have made.  I have gone negative with the real(p3) 
; parameter and increased the real(p4) paremeter to 1.5*(10^-101). 
; As a result, the minibrot that lies at the center is no longer 
; half folded up, it is totally transformed.  A real 'Sea Change' 
; has taken place, which is the name I gave the image.
; 
; Once again, I will not even try to explain what is going on in 
; the image, mainly because I have no idea.  It's hard enough to 
; think in 4 dimensions when dealing with the Julibrot figure, 
; much less the 8 dimensions of the HyperJulibrot.  All I can do 
; is sit back, study today's image, take a deep breath, and say 
; 'wow'.
; 
; The rating of an 8 reflects the mathematical interest.  The 
; pictorial worth is closer to a 6.5.  But I'm just getting 
; started with the HyperMandelbrot set.  There's a whole new world 
; waiting there, ready to be explored.  Sooner or later some great 
; fractal images are sure to emerge.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes is quite fast, and if 
; 'quite' is still too slow, the completed image may be viewed at 
; leisure on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The mild temperature of 57F 14C here at Fractal central on 
; Wednesday was not spoiled by the cloudy skies and fog bank 
; hanging over the river.  The fractal cats agreed that the day 
; was pleasant, and renewed their demand for an early treat.
; 
; My day was spent working and wondering what fractal wonders will 
; be found.  The next FOTD, most likely another variation of the 
; scene of yesterday and today, will be posted within 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and if empty space holds dark energy, is 
; it possible for absolutely 'nothing' to have ever existed?
