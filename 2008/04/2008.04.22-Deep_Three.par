; FOTD -- April 22, 2008 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yesterday's FOTD took us deep into Scepter Valley, the next 
; valley beyond Seahorse Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  Today's 
; image takes us deep into the third valley out the negative 
; X-axis, located around -1.368.  I think this valley is named 
; Double Scepter Valley.
; 
; Unlimited intricate detail characterizes the scene.  In fact, 
; there is actually so much small detail that it becomes overwhelm-
; ing.  Some of this excess detail is due to rendering the image 
; with the 'outside' set to 'summ', which works best with this 
; difficult-to-color fractal.
; 
; Due to the unusually large maxiter of over 3-million, all 
; variations of the logmap coloring method spread the bands much 
; too wide, resulting in large areas of a single flat color.  And 
; shutting off the logmap gives an image of near total chaos.  The 
; 'summ' option is far from perfect, but it is about as good as 
; can be done with this image.  The 'real' and 'imag' options work 
; almost exactly the same
; 
; I named the image "Deep Three" because it lies deep in the third 
; valley out the negative X-axis.  I declined to give it a rating 
; because I feel that if I had really worked on the raw image, I 
; could have done notably better.
; 
; But I have good news!  The calculation time is a sizzling 1/100 
; of one second under 3 minutes.  And even better news is that the 
; finished image is posted for instant gratification on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Partly cloudy and mild conditions prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central on Monday.  A high temperature of 70F 21C was very close 
; to normal.  The fractal cats enjoyed the sun while it was out, 
; and chased each other around F.C. when it was not.
; 
; In my department, the work was finished on schedule, leaving the 
; remainder of the afternoon free for a fractal search.  The next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be a 
; big-time thinker.
