; FOTD -- April 16, 2008 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; On Tuesday morning fractal lady made a remark about the comments 
; I so frequently insert at the close of the FOTD discussions.  
; She said that any psychologist who reads the FOTD could do a 
; pretty good psychological analysis of me.  I agreed with her.  
; And why not?  "After all, that's their job," I reminded her.
; 
; Analysis or not, I certainly do enjoy fractals.  It's not that 
; I'm trying to show that I'm an artist, it's simply that I enjoy 
; exploration, and discovering the abstract things that happen 
; when numbers start doing their thing.
; 
; In today's FOTD for example, I found a minibrot in a most unlike-
; ly place in yesterday's parent fractal -- in the rudimentary 
; East Valley of a larger but decaying minibrot at the edge of the 
; great fan.  Unfortunately, today's minibrot failed to live up to 
; the enthusiasm I felt when I first realized that it was there, 
; so I was forced to rate the scene at a third consecutive 6.5.
; 
; I named the image "Most Indeterminate" when I failed to find 
; what I expected.  To complicate matters even more, the calcula-
; tion time proved to be an unwieldy 8 minutes.  But eternal 
; salvation is at hand in the form of the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the completely calculated image is or soon will be posted 
; for immediate gratification and possible celestial enjoyment.
; 
; Perfect spring weather made Tuesday a near perfect day here at 
; Fractal Central, and the fractal cats agreed by spotting a pair 
; of squirrels scampering about the yard.  The dynamic duo made 
; sure the squirrels stayed out of trouble, while I finished the 
; nominal work.
; 
; The next FOTD is scheduled to appear in 24 hours.  And I would 
; not be surprised if it actually does appear.  Until then, take 
; care, and who cares what the world is made of?
