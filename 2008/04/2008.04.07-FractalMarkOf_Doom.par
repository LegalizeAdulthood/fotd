; FOTD -- April 07, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; One of the most accessible interpretations of the quantum 
; weirdness is the idea of multiple universes with multiple 
; versions of everything and everyone.  But this raises a question 
; that I have never been able to answer.  Are those other versions 
; of myself (and everyone else) really conscious, and if they are, 
; who are they?  Are they identical twins who are constantly 
; popping into existence complete with my stored memories, and if 
; so, how do I know that I am not merely a twin that popped into 
; existence a second or so ago, complete with a brain filled with 
; the memories of the original me, who or what ever that might be?
; 
; And at the other extreme, if those other versions of myself are 
; not conscious, then what is the difference?  Also, if some 
; supposedly conscious people in alternate worlds are not in fact 
; conscious, how many assumed conscious people in this world are 
; not actually conscious?  Finally, perhaps I am the only con-
; scious being in this entire universe.  (Solipsism?)
; 
; It is pathetically laughable to see intelligent and rational 
; scientists twisting themselves into such knots as multiple 
; universes to explain something that simply does not and can not 
; fit into the classical world-view.  I find the concept of a near-
; infinity of different versions of myself and everyone else in 
; multiple universes a prime example of 'clutching at straws'.  
; And IMO, when reason and logic lead to such an absurdity, it is 
; a sure sign that something monumentally important has been wrong 
; right from the start of the scientific method.  It seems as 
; though science is determined to self-destruct.  If so, I wish it 
; a pleasant journey.
; 
; As for today's fractal, it was rendered with the outside set to 
; 'fmod', and the initials of the name, "Fractal Mark of Doom", 
; spell out that option.
; 
; The scene lies in the Z^(1.99)+C Mandeloid as it appears 0.9 
; levels up the logarithmic ladder, where it is rotated about 100 
; degrees, so that the large period-3 north bud intersects the 
; positive X-axis, which in this case is a line of discontinuity.  
; Today's scene is located in the area of this intersection.  The 
; bailout radius of 1.79 is critical.
; 
; The rating of a 6 seems about right.  The picture really isn't 
; all that great.  The calculation time of just over 1 minute will 
; give no one impatience.  And the finished image is posted on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Sunday turned into the best day so far this spring here at 
; Fractal Central, as full sun, gentle breezes and a temperature 
; of 61F 16C combined to bring pleasure to all, including the 
; fractal cats, who spent an unusually long time in the afternoon 
; sun.
; 
; As for me, I did as little work as possible, trying to ignore 
; the grass, which is starting to turn green, but is still a 
; couple weeks from trimming stage.  The next FOTD will appear in 
; 24 hours, give or take a few.  Until then, take care, and would 
; the real me please stand up.
