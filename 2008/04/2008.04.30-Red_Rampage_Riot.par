; FOTD -- April 30, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's fractal "Red Rampage Riot".  After all, it does 
; have a good bit of red in it.  The parent fractal is another 
; variation on the square roots of 2 and 3, which appears as a 
; near-Mandelbrot set rotated 180 degrees.  Its most unusual 
; feature is the two infinitely divided main stems along the 
; positive X-axis, which instead of spreading apart as they move 
; farther from the origin, move together and ultimately join.  
; Today's image lies very deep in the area where the stems merge 
; and vanish.
; 
; The mathtolerance entry assures that the parameter file will run 
; at the correct magnitude.
; 
; I rated the image at a 7, which is close to the FOTD norm.  The 
; calculation time of 46 seconds is unusually fast, so running the 
; included parameter file will be no problem.  But if unexpected 
; problems do arise, the finished image may be seen on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Just before I sent off yesterday's FOTD, fractal lady happened 
; to glance at the end of the FOTD discussion, where I wrote that 
; I wonder if intelligent design and evolution may both be right.  
; She told me the sentence was silly, that only one could possibly 
; be right.  But I replied, "what's the big deal?"  Photons can 
; be either waves or particles, depending on what we want them to 
; be, and this, which is equally as silly, can easily be proved 
; scientifically.
; 
; Chilly but otherwise fair weather with a temperature of 55F 13C 
; prevailed here at Fractal Central on Tuesday.  The fractal cat 
; duo enjoyed the conditions from the less-chilly indoors.
; 
; I observed the conditions from the local garden center, where we 
; spent the afternoon planning for a better yard to come.  I 
; actually enjoyed it a little.  The next FOTD, maybe better than 
; today's, maybe not, will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and if it's not one, it must be the other.
