; FOTD -- April 01, 2008 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is the second consecutive merely average one.
; 
; Good fractals seem to come in clusters.  I named today's evapo-
; rated image "Flowery Failure" because it just doesn't have that 
; certain something that causes me to feel that 'this is a very 
; good one'.  And I can't say what the image lacks.  It has enough 
; sparkling emerald detail, and certainly enough contrast.  The 
; parent fractal seems promising enough, so why then could I give 
; today's image a rating of only a very average 5?
; 
; It must be that there have been too many similar fractals in the 
; long history of the FOTD.
; 
; Regardless, the parent fractal, which was created when I com-
; bined one negative part of Z^(-1.5) with 0.3 negative part of 
; Z^(-3.3) and added (1/C), is one of those rambling things that 
; cannot be described.  basically, it consists of a series of 
; circular bays and smaller sub-bays, with today's scene located 
; in a skeletal valley on the southeast shoreline of a large 
; eastern sub-bay.
; 
; As I mentioned earlier, the image was evaporated by raising the 
; escape radius to 10^50, which is not one-half of 10^100, but 
; 1/(10^50)th of it.  The resulting blank screen was restored to 
; life by rendering the scene with the inside set to 'bof61'.
; 
; Finally, the calculation time of 2-2/3 minutes may be bypassed 
; by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather absolutely stank here at Fractal Central on Monday.  
; Heavy clouds, drizzle and a temperature of 41F 5C prevailed all 
; day.  The local fractal cats checked the outside conditions 
; once, then decided to spend their day, as they do every day -- 
; inside.
; 
; My day was about as busy as expected, though I was a bit disap-
; pointed by the gaudy but somehow humdrum fractal.  I'll try 
; again for fractal excellence in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and if it is true that nothing is real, what just wrote 
; that nothing is real?
