; FOTD -- June 09, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; While FL and I were sitting on the shore of a nearby lake Sunday 
; afternoon, watching the duck families peacefully swim past, she 
; innocently commented on how cynical I am becoming in my later 
; years.  She said that I seem to be turning against everything, 
; especially science, religion and politics.  She asked me what, 
; if anything, I now approve of.
; 
; Well, I replied, it's rather hard to approve of a science that 
; fails to include the most important thing of all -- self-aware-
; ness -- in its search for a theory of everything.  (This is why 
; I refer to this theory as 'the theory of almost everything'.)  
; Perhaps the omission is an oversight, or perhaps the physicists 
; do not yet realize that self-awareness is included in the set of 
; everything.  If so, this omission should be acknowledged and 
; corrected.  Or could it be that they fear ridicule, or even 
; worse, that their venerated scientific method is powerless?
; 
; And it's just as hard to approve of the world's religions, 
; which, after pronouncing conflicting doctrines for thousands of 
; years, have still not found a way to demonstrate that the super-
; natural things they teach, such as God and the afterlife even 
; exist.  As I often comment, "It seems as though God gave us the 
; faculty of reason so we couild understand his universe, but when 
; we use this gift of reason, we are led to the conclusion that He 
; does not exist."  As the nuns used to say, 'it's a mystery'.  Oh 
; well, I guess a mystery is better than an accident.
; 
; As for politics, the less said the better.  And this is no 
; mystery.
; 
; But this leaves the big question unanswered.  What do I approve 
; of?
; 
; Why I approve of fractals.  And today's fractal is a typical 
; example.  The image consists of the entire parent fractal 
; created by the formula Z^(1.237)+C as it appears 14 levels up 
; the logarithmic ladder when the 'floor' function is used.
; 
; Without the 'bof60' inside fill, the fractal is rather dull, 
; but with this fill the inside explodes to life.  And check those 
; crazy orbit paths of the points around the edges of the circle 
; inside the fractal.  It's those wild orbits that led me to try 
; the various inside options on the originally bland fractal.  Too 
; bad the orbits cannot be included in a parameter file.
; 
; I rated the image at an 8.  It's worth it.  And I named it "On 
; Fire Inside", which the fractal most certainly is.  The calcula-
; tion time of just over 2 minutes means that no one will suffer 
; fractal exhaustion waiting for the parameter file to finish 
; running.
; 
; An even better way to stay refreshed in such hot weather is to 
; visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the finished GIF image there.
; 
; Hot sun, high humidity, and a temperature of 95F 35C made Sunday 
; another lazy day here at Fractal Central.  Luckily, Fractal 
; Central is only 1/4 mile from Lake Augusta, where peeping 
; duckling and gosling families make it seem 10 degrees cooler.  
; The fractal cats see baby ducks and geese as food however, not 
; as psychological air conditioners.  So they spent the day safely 
; indoors, keeping cool as best they could.
; 
; My fractal search went well enough, and hopefully, tomorrow's 
; search will go even better.  The next FOTD fractal will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if we don't know 
; what we don't know, how will we know what we know when we find 
; the answer?
