; FOTD -- June 26, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; My thoughts today are rambling, but here goes:
; 
; Today's image introduces us to a higher fractal reality.  Yes, I 
; know that skeptics amd materialists grow uncomfortable when the 
; subject turns to metaphysical philosophy, which they distrust.  
; But I am fascinated by metaphysical things, particularly the 
; things commonly known as paranormal, some of which I have 
; discovered in recent years to be true.
; 
; This interest in the paranormal goes back to the seven days 
; immediately preceding 9-11-01, when I had seven consecutive 
; precognitive dreams that changed me from a questioner to a 
; believer, or more accurately, a knower.)
; 
; The TV channels are filled with not-too-convincing shows about 
; paranormal things such as Astrology, ghosts and fortune telling 
; etc., but where are the shows about fractals -- things that do 
; not exist in the normally accepted way, yet can still be object-
; ively pictured with the correct equipment?
; 
; I can remember only one or two TV shows devoted entirely to 
; fractals, and they were aired many years ago.  Perhaps people 
; are now more concerned with alien space ships and getting a 
; message from the recently departed uncle George than with that 
; dull mathematical stuff.
; 
; Or maybe things are not so bad, and there actually are a few 
; hard science channels that I have yet to hear of which actually 
; program real rational science.  Of course, if all the paranormal 
; stuff is for real, which it very well might be, then it is the 
; hard-core science channels that are behind the times when they 
; try to explain everything in a common-sense rational way.
; 
; Now back to the fractal at hand.  I named today's image "A 
; Higher Reality" in recognition of the higher realities that 
; visionaries, including the fractal variety, sometimes 
; experience, and also the fact that the minibrot in today's image 
; is of an unusually high order.  And yes, get those skeptical 
; knees jerking in disbelief.  By higher realities I do mean 
; higher spiritual planes as depicted in occult lore.
; 
; Today's image lies on the main spike of the parent fractal, 
; which on the surface resembles a Mandelbrot set but deep inside 
; has order-12 characteristics.  It is located a short distance 
; east of the large main-spike minibrot, which must be seen to be 
; believed.
; 
; With the DivideBrot2 formula, the order of the deep minibrots is 
; the sum of the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts 
; of the p1 parameter.
; 
; I rated the image at an 8, since it's just about the best 
; order-12 minibrot I have ever seen.  The calculation time of 42 
; seconds is one of the briefest of all time.  Of course, nothing 
; could be briefer than the few seconds required to visit the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the finished image there.
; 
; Another near perfect day prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Wednesday.  I knew the day was near perfect when it earned the 
; seal of approval of the fractal cats, who enjoy lots of sun and 
; a temperature around 82F 28C.
; 
; In my departmant the day was suitably busy.  Tomorrow will not 
; only likely be the same, but it will also bring another FOTD.  
; Until then, take care, and I have found that it is indeed 
; possible to enjoy rational science, which can demonstrate the 
; truth of its statements, and at the same time know that some 
; claims of the paranormal, which are scientifically impossible, 
; are true nevertheless.
