; FOTD -- June 18, 2008 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I seem to be in one of those occasional fractal ruts, where I 
; just can't seem to come up with a fractal that meets even my 
; lowly standards of fractal worth.  Yesterday's image was 
; probably the least impressive FOTD of the past 11 years, and 
; that's talking about a lot of fractals.
; 
; Today's image is a small bit of an improvement.  It is a view of 
; Seahorse Valley, a slit view that I can virtually guarantee has 
; never before been seen.  The view is almost in the Rectangular 
; direction, oriented so close to it that it was necessary to 
; stretch the scene about 75 times in the vertical direction 
; before the remnant of Seahorse Valley became recognizable.  (The 
; rectangular orientation is determined by the imag(z) and imag(c) 
; axes of the Julibrot.)
; 
; Where is the rest of the Mandelbrot set?  This is a question I 
; cannot answer.  It is probably off somewhere, a lost potentia in 
; a space of five or more dimensions, making the quest absolutely 
; futile.  I have been trying unsuccessfully for 20 years or so to 
; visualize something with only four spatial dimensions, so far 
; without success.  Apparently I need to have my consciousness 
; expanded before higher-dimensional awarenedd becomes possible.  
; Maybe the local mystic, Madam Zucchini, can be of help.
; 
; I named today's image "Portal to Infinity" and rated it at a 5.  
; The calculation time of under 2 minutes should cause no 
; hardships.  And to be doubly sure no hardships are incurred, the 
; completed GIF image has been posted for instant viewing and 
; enjoyment on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A very pleasant and refreshing day here at Fractal Central on 
; Tuesday, with a temperature of 72F 22C, was made even fresher by 
; a quick shower that passed over at 6pm, followed by a brilliant 
; rainbow in the east.  The fractal cats, not appreciating the 
; small pleasures of nature, slept through it all.
; 
; My day was busier than I would have preferred, but much better 
; than yesterday, when I posted a hasty fractal that virtually 
; duplicated and was a poor imitation of the not-all-that-great 
; image of the day before.  The current work rush has about ended 
; however, so tomorrow's FOTD, which will appear in the usual 24 
; hours, will likely be a vast improvement over today's.  Until 
; then, take care, and walk with the fractal elite.
