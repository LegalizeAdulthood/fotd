; FOTD -- June 02, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Warning!  Expect no answers in this discussion, only questions.
; 
; There is a second fractal 'artist' here at F.C., one known as 
; F.L., who usually prefers to lurk invisibly in the background, 
; but sometimes says things that start an all-day line of thought 
; going in my head.  On Sunday she happened to catch a glance of 
; today's image, and asked "why do the numbers you picked make a 
; fractal that looks like a circle of eight owl's faces and not 
; something like an icy tree?"
; 
; I replied, "for the same reason that one plus one equals two and 
; not three."  But this is no answer at all.  One plus one equals 
; two because that's the way it is and it couldn't possibly be any 
; other way.  (I think it took B. Russell about 50 pages to prove 
; that one plus one equals two, shortly before the whole point of 
; his immense work was disproved by Godel.)
; 
; But it's far different to state that one plus one must equal two 
; than to state that today's fractal parameters must always equal 
; a circle of eight figures vaguely resembling owl's faces.  The 
; first fact is intuitively obvious, the second must be accepted 
; on the faith that the computer's fractal math routine calculates 
; unambiguous truth.  (Something I am not at all certain of.)
; 
; During my no-longer-short life, I have 'wasted' countless hours 
; trying to visualize the fourth dimension, and just as many hours 
; wondering about things such as why I was born at a certain time 
; to live a life as a U.S. citizen, and not 800 years ago to live 
; a life as a nomad in Outer Mongolia or even as a deer to be 
; devoured by a lion in central Africa.  I also find it quite 
; incredible that the universe should at this very moment be in 
; the infinitesimal slice of time in which I will exist to observe 
; and wonder about it.
; 
; It must be true that a fool such as I can invent more questions 
; than a wise man can answer.
; 
; But this is not all.  In addition, I have recently concluded 
; that the perception of an outer universe (reality if you will) 
; of three spatial dimensions is a function of the level of 
; consciousness of humanity.
; 
; As to why I am the person I am, and why the universe is in the 
; infinitesimal period of time in which I will exist, it seems to 
; be a matter of definition.  How could it be any other way?
; 
; Such an answer does not totally satisfy however.  After all, 
; does not the universe obey the mathematical laws of an objective 
; three-dimensional space?
; 
; But mathematics is a human invention, developed to be a symbolic 
; statement of abstract human thought processes.  Man certainly 
; would never have developed a math that would be valid only in a 
; perceived universe of four spatial dimensions.  I now wonder 
; whether our mathematics describes an objective reality at all, 
; or if we intentionally designed and tweaked it to work with a 
; three-dimensional space that we mentally create around us.
; 
; The question of why the universe is in the tiny slice of time in 
; which I exist might be a wrong question based on a wrong percep-
; tion.  Relativity shows that there is no universal time which is 
; true throughout the vast expanse of space.  Each individual 
; exists in his own unique present moment.  We need to somehow re-
; phrase the question.
; 
; I suspect that the question of why I am myself is also a wrong 
; question, based on another misperception.
; 
; So now, instead of searching for the correct answers, I find 
; myself still searching for the proper questions.  Perhaps it's 
; time to turn to fractals.
; 
; Today's image is named "Eight Hooting Owls" because that's what 
; F.L. saw when she caught sight of it.  It rates an 8 because I 
; think it's a rather good image.
; 
; The parent fractal is the same one that produced yesterday's 
; image.  But instead of lying at the edge of the fan, today's 
; image lies almost at the dead center of the fan.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes is logical and provable.  
; Just as logically provable is the fact that the image will soon 
; be posted for viewing on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Near perfect conditions prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Sunday, with low humidity, lots of sunshine, gentle winds, 
; puffy cumulus clouds, and a temperature of 79F 26C 299K 21R.  
; The fractal cats, unconcerned about which temperature scale to 
; use, (Celsius is probably the best), found their comfort in the 
; sunniest window.
; 
; My day was pleasant enough, though thanks to F.L., the nagging 
; and unanswered questions simply would not go away.  But despite 
; this, the next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and there must be aleph^(aleph) questions that never 
; have been and never will be asked, much less answered.
