; FOTD -- June 11, 2008 (rating in doubt)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When the parent fractal of today's image is rotated minus 90 
; degrees, it resembles a Mister Potatohead toy, with a ridicu-
; lously large period-2 bud stuck on its left shoulder, a period-3 
; wart on its right shoulder, and a period-5 pimple on its butt. 
; Today's scene lies in the western valley leading to the period-5 
; pimple.  I have no idea what happened to a potential period-4 
; pimple.
; 
; Anyway, today's image has little to recommend it.  Due to the 
; threat of lightning, I kept the computers unplugged most of the 
; afternoon, which left little time for a proper fractal search.
; 
; The only thing today's image has going for it is its striped 
; appearance, which was created by rendering the scene with the 
; outside set to 'tdis'.  But even the stripes are so finely 
; divided that they lose most of their effect.  As a result, I 
; gave the image no rating.
; 
; The name "According to Hoyle" simply came to mind as I studied 
; the image.  (Perhaps a psych could do a fair analysis of me from 
; the names I give the FOTD images.)
; 
; The final bad news is the calculation time, which is a dragging 
; 25 minutes.  Run the parameter file if you wish, but I recommend 
; visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image is or soon will be posted for instant access.
; 
; Tuesday here at Fractal Central started sunny and very warm.  
; But a series of brisk thunder-showers moved in around 3pm and 
; continued until dark.  The temperature reached a high of 93F 34C 
; just after noon, but by 6pm was down to a very comfortable 75F 
; 24C.  The fractal cats rejoiced.
; 
; And if the next FOTD, which will be posted in 24 hours, is 
; better than today's, I will rejoice also.  Until the rejoicing 
; starts, take care, and as the wise shepherd says, when you see a 
; storm coming, get the flock out of there.
