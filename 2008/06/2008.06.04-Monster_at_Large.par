; FOTD -- June 04, 2008 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The more I watch those popularized 'science' programs on the 
; leading 'science' channels, the more misinformation I notice in 
; the shows, and the more I wonder who, if anyone, is checking the 
; accuracy of the things presented as demonstrated fact.
; 
; As a single example, on a recent show where the topic was condi-
; tions on other worlds, the narrator was describing the condi-
; tions we would find if we were to land on the surface of Titan, 
; the giant moon of Saturn.  Titan is thought to have weather much 
; like earth's, with a surface covered with seas of cold liquid 
; methane, which falls as showers from rain clouds as water does 
; on earth.  The narrator said that there is enough liquid fuel on 
; Titan to power the earth for millions of years.
; 
; This much seemed true enough, but then he said that if anyone 
; were to strike a match on Titan, the entire moon would instantly 
; burst into flame and burn into a barren airless world like our 
; own moon Luna.
; 
; When I heard this, my first thought was how fortunate it is that 
; no lightning exists on Titan, and then I thought about how 
; unlikely a total lack of lightning would be in an active plan-
; etary atmosphere with precipitation like earth's.
; 
; But then I remembered that fuel such as methane burns by combin-
; ing chemically with oxygen, which on Titan must be as hard to 
; come by as methane is on earth.  On Titan oxygen would be the 
; fuel!  A resident on Titan would look enviously to earth and 
; marvel at how energy-rich we are.
; 
; On Titan, if it were possible to strike a match in the cold 
; methane atmosphere, the match would sputter and instantly be 
; snuffed out.  It would not cause the entire planet to explode.  
; Let's get our science straight, guys.
; 
; In addition to wondering about inaccurate statements, I also 
; wonder why the 'science' oriented channels load their schedules 
; with so many programs about possible catastrophes, such as 'the 
; asteroid strikes earth, civilization collapses and mankind is 
; exterminated'.  Maybe when people worry they buy more of the 
; sponsors' products, but that's another story.
; 
; Today's comparatively harmless fractal is unlikely to cause such 
; worry.  I found it lurking in the parent fractal that results 
; when the formula Z^(1.237)+C is calculated 11 levels up the 
; abstract logarithmic hyper-ladder when no function is used.
; 
; This parent fractal resembles some kind of monster stretching 
; out its filamentary arms to engulf the unwary fractalist.  
; Today's image is located in the monster's right filament-arm.
; 
; I named the image "Monster at Large" after this monster of my 
; fancy.  I rated it at a 5 because I don't particularly enjoy 
; monsters, especially of the fractal kind.
; 
; But the brief calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes is nothing to be 
; afraid of.  And if even this is too slow, the finished image may 
; be accessed instantly on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Tuesday morning was fair enough here at Fractal Central, but 
; clouds arrived during the afternoon, disappointing the fractal 
; cats.  The temperature of 81F 27C felt quite muggy due to the 
; high humidity.
; 
; My day was busy but thoughtful.  All I needed was a subject fit 
; to ponder.  The next in the FOTD series is due to be posted in 
; 24 hours, and the odds that this will actually happen are favor-
; able.  Until next FOTD, take care, and settle your thoughts.
