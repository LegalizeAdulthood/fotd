; FOTD -- June 06, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's rather superior image lies in the fractal that is 
; produced by the formula Z^5+Z^3+C, a fractal that consists of 
; two large bays, one stacked on top of the other.  The southern 
; bay is partially cut off; the northern bay is less eroded, but 
; its buds have the distinct look of being non-critical, with 
; spurious arms pointing toward the mouths of the valleys.
; 
; In the fractal world however, looks are sometimes deceiving.  
; I found today's scene on the southern side of the extra arm 
; that fills the large western bud of the north bay.
; 
; The rather impressive silvery color palette is mostly serendipi-
; tous.  The Fractint program should get most of the credit for 
; creating the colors with one strike of the <enter> key.  I did 
; nothing more than tweak a few color registers.
; 
; The image actually consists of half-inside, half-outside stuff.  
; The inside parts have been rendered with the inside fill set to 
; 'bof61'.
; 
; The rating of an 8 might even be a bit of an under-estimate.  
; The name "The Age of Silver" refers to the unusual coloring.  
; The calculation time of 2-1/3 minutes is a far better value than 
; was found in yesterday's loser.
; 
; Downloading the finished 'gif' image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; is always a winning move however.
; 
; A hot muggy day here at Fractal Central on Thursday gave ample 
; warning that summer is not far off.  The temperature of 84F 29C 
; and humidity of 70 percent confirmed the diagnosis.  The fractal 
; cats must have reached the same conclusion.  In the afternoon 
; they switched from sleeping curled-up to sleeping stretched-out.
; 
; I switched from being busy to having free time as the day 
; progressed.  The next FOTD will be presented to the breathless 
; world within 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and wait with 
; anticipation.
