; FOTD -- June 27, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was created with the third version of the 
; DivideBrot formula, which is notably faster and more intuitive 
; than version 2, the version I have been using until now.  I will 
; probably make a few more changes before finalizing the formula 
; as DivideBrot4.
; 
; Today's image shows an order-17 minibrot lying on the negative 
; spike of the parent Mandelbrot set, very near the escape radius. 
; I know that it's impossible to have order-17 minibrots in a 
; fractal that on the surface appears exactly like the classic 
; Mandelbrot set, but I suppose something in the formula never got 
; the message, for this is what we have in today's image.
; 
; The image was spiced up a little by rendering it with the 
; outside set to 'tdis'.  Everything else comes from the numbers 
; themselves.
; 
; I could have used a little more time to work on the coloring, 
; which explains the rating of only a 6.  The name of the image 
; "Order Septemdecem" is simply a fancy way of saying 'order-17'.
; 
; The calculation time of today's image is an astoundingly brief 
; 13 seconds.  So why not take a moment to run the included 
; parameter file.  Those with machines that get a case of 
; indigestion when faced with Fractint may go to the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and see the finished image in its full semi-glory there.
; 
; Thursday began with heavy clouds and light rain here at Fractal 
; Central.  But the rain ended at 10am and the sun appeared around 
; noon, leading to an afternoon that was hazy, warm and humid, 
; with a temperature of 86F 30C.  The fractal cats enjoyed the sun 
; when it first appeared, but sought cooler spots when it got too 
; warm.
; 
; I spent my free time working on the new formula and responding 
; to an e-mail on the Fractint list.  I'll probably make a few 
; more changes in the formula before I have a final version.  The 
; next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; seek the elusive fractal.
