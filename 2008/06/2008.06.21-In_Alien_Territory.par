; FOTD -- June 21, 2008 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Wow!  What a fractal!  Talk about over-qualified!  This is one 
; of the most bombastic fractal images I have ever seen.  It has 
; no idea where to stop.  The super-abundance of detail is so 
; overdone that it actually detracts from the rating, which I 
; could set at no more than a 5.
; 
; The image is a scene in the Mandelbrot aspect of the East Valley 
; of the same parent Julibrot that has supplied the past two days' 
; images.  I named the image "In Alien Territory", though I'm not 
; sure where this alien territory is found.
; 
; I used no gimmicks to produce the overwhelming detail in the 
; image, which was rendered with the inside set to the color zero 
; and the outside set to display equal-iteration bands.  All the 
; excitement lies in the numbers of the image itself.
; 
; The calculation time of just over 3 minutes should give no one a 
; case of impatience.  And for even more convenience, the finished 
; image is or soon will be posted for instant viewing on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A routinely pleasant day prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Friday, with partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 77F 25C.  
; The fractal cats noticed the conditions, then continued eating 
; their dinner.  My day was once again busier than I would have 
; preferred, but not so busy as to affect the attention I gave to 
; the FOTD, which failed to fulfill my hopes on its own account.  
; The next FOTD is due to be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and look before you iterate.
