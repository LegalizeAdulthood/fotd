; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'm not sure whether this borderline stuff is exactly on topic, 
; but fractals certainly hold higher-dimensions, so why not our 
; so-called 'real' world.
; 
; I recently claimed to have experienced precognitive dreams.  But 
; this does not mean that I believe it is possible for Madam 
; Zucchini, who runs a fortune-telling shop down on the corner, to 
; know the future.  If it were possible to do so, she would not 
; need to run such a questionable business.  She would merely need 
; to buy a lottery ticket.  She would know the winning number by 
; using her occult powers.
; 
; What such fortune-tellers do is known as cold reading, where 
; they fish information from their patrons by clever questioning.  
; It's a technique known to every aspiring magician, which in-
; volves nothing more than a bit of everyday psychology and a bit 
; of good old common-sense.  Spiritualist mediums run their busi-
; nesses pretty much the same way.
; 
; But at the same time, I do not claim that it is impossible for 
; information about the future to get into the past.  In the case 
; of my precognitive dreams I did not at any time *know* the 
; future.  After the attack happened, I realized that information 
; from the future had somehow gone back into the past and in some 
; manner had affected my dreams.
; 
; But this in itself is incredible.  It is even more paranormal 
; than so-called communication with spirits of the dead, where all 
; that would be needed would be for spirits of the dead to 
; actually exist and to be able to communicate with the living, 
; two perfectly intuitive, if not apparent, things.
; 
; By contrast, there appears to be no possible way for information 
; to now exist about an event that does not yet exist.  In fact, 
; if such backwards causality were ever shown to be true, we would 
; need to adjust the entire philosophical foundation of science.  
; The only way out of the situation that I am aware of is to claim 
; that such intense precognitive dreams such as mine are one of 
; those extremely unlikely coincidences, which against all odds, 
; sometimes happen -- perhaps a one-in-a-googol chance.
; 
; In comparison with precognition, I am firmly convinced that 
; there are no space aliens visiting earth in their UFO space 
; ships.  The distances involved are far too vast and worm holes 
; are unlikely in the extreme.  Also, no clear pictures of UFO's 
; have ever been obtained even with the ever-increasing number of 
; video cameras and cell-phone cameras, which now are almost 
; everywhere.  In my opinion, aliens in UFO's are an example of 
; suggestibility combined with wishful thinking.
; 
; Yet despite this disbelief of most 'borderline' things, I must 
; still face the fact that information somehow now exists about 
; events that do not yet exist, and this pre-information actually 
; can affect peoples' minds.  If I do not accept an impossibly 
; unlikely coincidence, I must accept that the outer world has 
; hidden dimensions, (which physicists also claim), or the human 
; mind has hidden dimensions, (which occultists claim), or perhaps 
; both.
; 
; One thing for certain however, which can be demonstrated at 
; will, is that fractals have hidden dimensions.  In fact, this 
; might be why I enjoy them so.  Today's image is a perfect 
; example of a hidden dimension.  Inside the parent fractal, which 
; appears as a Mandelbrot set, lies a whole hidden quintic world.  
; The image shows one of the quintic minibrots in the parent's 
; depths.  It is located in the East Valley of the largest mini-
; brot on the filament complex extending from the large period-3 
; north bud of its parent Mandelbrot set.
; 
; I rated the image at a 6.  It's a little too mundane to be worth 
; more.  I named it "Five Strikes and You're Out" when I recalled 
; what the Ednor Gardens Eagles used to yell at the umpire when we 
; thought he was too generous with the opposing batters.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/4 minutes is well within reason even 
; if getting information from the future is not.  And as always, 
; the finished image is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A muggy day here at Fractal Central on Saturday, with a tempera-
; ture of 88F 31C, was climaxed by an exciting thunder-storm at 
; 10pm, which dropped to temperature to 72F 22, making the fractal 
; cats as well as the local humans very comfortable for the night. 
; I totally avoided work during the day, which made both myself 
; and FL very happy.  The next FOTD fractal will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and truth is elusive.
