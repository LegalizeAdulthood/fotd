; FOTD -- March 29, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal began with great promise, but by the time the 
; finished product was ready, the promise had all but vanished.  
; I'm not quite sure what's wrong with the image.  Maybe it's the 
; colors, of perhaps the overly busy appearance.  Maybe it's that 
; the minibrot too closely resembles those in the more remote 
; valleys of the classic M-set.  But whatever it is, I could rate 
; the image no higher than a 6.  The name "Not Quite There" shows 
; my disappointment.
; 
; The formula of the parent fractal subtracts 1/2 part of Z^(-2) 
; from 1/2 part of Z^2 and adds C.  The parent itself consists of 
; a scattering of Mandeloids, with today's scene located in a 
; valley on the south side of the largest bud of the largest 
; Mandeloid.
; 
; In an attempt to add interest, I rendered the image with the 
; outside set to 'tdis', which is the setting I use almost as 
; frequently as the standard equal-iteration bands.  The result 
; was not all that I had hoped.
; 
; The calculation time of 9 minutes could be faster, but it also 
; could be slower.  All calculation problems may be bypassed 
; however by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; Friday started rainy here at Fractal Central, but by mid-morning 
; the rain ended and by mid-afternoon the sun appeared.  When the 
; temperature reached 48F 9C, the day actually became quite 
; pleasant.  The fractal cats enjoyed the sun when it finally 
; broke through.
; 
; My day was notably average.  The next FOTD will make its initial 
; appearance in 24 hours more or less.  Until then, take care, and 
; be true to your fractals or they'll be false to you.
