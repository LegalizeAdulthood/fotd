; FOTD -- March 05, 2008 (Rating 3.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's rare that I post a FOTD that rates as low as a 3.5, but in 
; all honesty, that's all I could give today's image.  It's colors 
; are bland and its theme, if any theme exists, is vague to say 
; the least.
; 
; The parent fractal is a grossly overblown thing created when 4.5 
; negative parts of Z^(-1.5) are combined with 1.5 negative parts 
; of Z^(-4.5) and (1/C) is added.  This parent is better seen than 
; described, though I will remark that today's scene is located in 
; the western branch of the valley that forms the northern border 
; of the largest bay.
; 
; I named the image "Incomprehensibility", which has little to do 
; with the image.  The word was the longest one I knew how to 
; spell in the third grade.  (I had not yet found the longer word 
; "antidisestablishmentarianism".)
; 
; The calculation time of just over 2 minutes can be reduced to 
; next to nothing by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Moderate to heavy rain fell all day Tuesday here at Fractal 
; Central, while the temperature hovered around 39F 4C, making it 
; a most unpleasant day.  The fractal cats interrupted their sleep 
; several times to check the weather.
; 
; My day was busy, and it shows in the lackluster Fractal of the 
; Day.  The next FOTD, hopefully with much more luster, will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and why are we so 
; concerned with a "theory of everything", which few people are 
; really concerned about, when we don't even know the meaning of 
; life, which everyone is concerned about.  (Denying that life has 
; a meaning, or claiming that its purpose is merely to propogate 
; our genetic material is an evasion unworthy of a rational being.)
