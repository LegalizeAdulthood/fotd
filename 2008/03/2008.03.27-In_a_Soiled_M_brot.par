; FOTD -- March 28, 2008 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; One of the reasons I am fascinated with fractals is because they 
; are four-dimensional things, and I waste no end of time futilely 
; trying to visualize a four-dimensional anything.  Many phenomena 
; in 4-D hyperspace have similar things in our familiar 3-D space, 
; which help us to understand hyperspace.  But there is at least 
; one thing in 4-D space (I am sure many others exist.) that is 
; totally unlike anything in our 3-D space.  That thing is the 
; motion called double rotation.
; 
; In 3-D space an object rotates about a line as its axis, and due 
; to the gyroscopic effect, that line will retain its orientation. 
; But in 4-D space a 4-D object rotates about a plane as its axis, 
; which makes the situation more complex.  In a simple 3-D type of 
; rotation, the points of a 4-D object describe a circle, while an 
; entire plane of the object remains fixed in place as its points 
; turn on themselves.  And just as in 3-D space, the gyroscopic 
; effect will keep the object rotating in the same direction.
; 
; But what of that axis plane, where the points remain stationary, 
; while turning in place?  This is the weird thing.  Since the 
; axis-points are not moving, they are not subject to the gyrosco-
; pic effect, and the entire axis-plane can turn on itself around 
; its center point, carrying the entire 4-D object with it, while 
; the entire object continues to rotate in the first direction.  
; The object is now in a state of double rotation, a motion 
; totally alien to our familiar 3-D objects.
; 
; While fantasizing a walk on a 4-D hyperplanet recently, and 
; trying to imagine the apparent motion of the heavenly bodies, I 
; realized that I was perilously close to visualizing double 
; rotation, (as projected into 3-D space of course.)  What I 
; imagined is extremely difficult to put into words, but I'll give 
; it a try in a near-future FOTD discussion.
; 
; As for today's image, it lies in the parent fractal that results 
; when 0.01 part of Z^(-2) is subtracted from the classic 
; Mandelbrot set.  This fractal is a distorted M-set, filled with 
; debris.  Today's image is located in the East Valley area of the 
; remains of the large minibrot on the negative X-axis of the 
; M-set.
; 
; I named the image "In a Soiled M-brot", which the parent fractal 
; most certainly is.  I rated it at an 8-1/2 -- 8 points for the 
; underlying fractal, 1/2 point for my coloring work.
; 
; The calculation time of only 49 seconds means that no one will 
; be disappointed with the result.  Some may prefer to avoid the 
; calculation however, so for convenience, the finished image is 
; or soon will be posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Good weather in early spring never lasts long in Central 
; Pennsylvania, so we were not too disappointed here at Fractal 
; Central when Thursday turned out cloudy, chilly and drizzly.  
; The temperature of 45F 7C kept people well wrapped, while the 
; drizzly mist kept the rain gear handy.  The fractal cats kept 
; cozy near the heat.
; 
; My day was on the busy side, though not too busy to affect the 
; fractal.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and there is more to empty space than meets the eye.
