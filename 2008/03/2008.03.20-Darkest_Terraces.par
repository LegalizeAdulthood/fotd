; FOTD -- March 20, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I often see TV shows about true-believing psychics who know that 
; psychic powers do exist, and I see TV shows about true-disbelie-
; ving skeptics who know that such powers are not real, and both 
; sides are adamant in their opposing convictions.  My opinion is 
; that both sides are correct.  Psychic powers are not real but 
; they do exist.  (Don't ask for an explanation, just add this 
; paradox to the long list of other paradoxes uncovered by our old 
; friend, 'modern science'.)  The dispute is as silly and meaning-
; less as debating whether fractals exist.  Fractals are not real, 
; but they do exist -- just like ghosts and bigfoots.
; 
; Take today's fractal image for example.  Run the included para-
; meter file and a minute later you will see the image on your 
; screen.  There is no doubt of it, fractals do exist, for you can 
; see one with your own eyes, and what you see most certainly does 
; not exist only in your mind (whatever that means).
; 
; But now try to find the physical object that was photographed to 
; produce the image on the screen.  No matter where or how far you 
; search, you will never find the actual physical object.  No such 
; object exists.  When we imply the fullest meaning of the word 
; 'real', fractals do not quite measure up.
; 
; Today's image lies in the parent fractal that comes about when 
; various portions of Z^3 and Z^5 are combined and 1.038i is added 
; to initial Z.  I think this is the first time I have used the 
; ability of the MandAutoCritInZ formula to vary the automatically 
; preset value of initial Z.  The result appears a lot more like a 
; critical fractal than the one the formula calculates automati-
; cally when imag(p4) is left at zero.  But the resulting fractal 
; is not exactly critical.  Today's image shows a 'dry valley', 
; which is a sure sign that a fractal is not exactly critical.  
; 
; To add interest I rendered the image with the outside set to 
; 'tdis' and the inside set to 'fmod'.  The result reminds me of 
; vaguely threatening terraces, so I named the image "Darkest 
; Terraces".  The calculation time of 1-2/3 minutes will pass like 
; lightning for the true fractal fan.  The trip to the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to view the finished image will also pass like lightning.
; 
; With a temperature of 48F 9C, it was not too chilly here at F.C. 
; on Wednesday, but thick clouds, fog, and near continuous showers 
; kept it far from being pleasant.  The fractal DSH cats agreed, 
; and spent the day sleeping on the couch.
; 
; My day was uneventful; the work was finished by 3pm.  If the 
; next 24 hours are just as uneventful, the FOTD for March 21 will 
; appear at the end of that period.  Until then, take care, and 
; where was the Mandelbrot set 100 years ago?
