; FOTD -- March 14, 2008 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The March issue of 'Sci-Am' magazine has an article about the 
; expanding universe that I found interesting.  It appears that in 
; the unimaginably distant future the universe will have expanded 
; until all the galaxies except those of the local cluster will 
; have receded beyond the event horizon.  And also by that time, 
; all the galaxies in the local cluster will have condensed into 
; a single giant elliptical galaxy, consisting of very slowly 
; dying red-dwarf stars.  The most distant objects visible will be 
; dim red stars perhaps 200,000 light-years distant, and all 
; evidence of the expansion of the universe and therefore of the 
; 'big-bang' that we presently assume created the universe will 
; have vanished.
; 
; If any astronomers still exist in that remote future time, the 
; thought of an explosive 'big-bang' origin of the universe would 
; never have entered their minds.  They would have no clues as to 
; how the 'universe', which by then would be a single elliptical 
; galaxy filled with small dying red stars, came into existence.  
; Most likely the astronomers of the year 10-trillion would invent 
; ingenious scientific theories that would appear logical to them, 
; but would seem ludicrous to us with our present broader view.
; 
; Of course, when we consider our current 'big bang' hypothesis, 
; we are in the same situation as those distant future astronomers 
; would be.  We have no idea of what might have caused the assumed 
; 'big bang' that created the universe.  The simplest way out is 
; to brush the problem aside by claiming that time as we know it 
; did not exist before the 'big bang'.  If we assume this, we can 
; then claim that it is meaningless to ask what happened 'before' 
; the 'big bang'.  But this is really spinning our way out of the 
; problem.  As I said a week or two ago, we don't even know what 
; we don't know, and this is especially true of me.
; 
; I do know something about today's image however.  It exists in 
; the same parent fractal as the past 3 days' images, and lies 
; just beyond the edge of the 'fan'.
; 
; The name "Arc of Evaporation" describes the prominent dividing 
; line that runs diagonally through the image and separates the 
; 'evaporated' from the 'unevaporated' parts of the scene.  This 
; apparently straight line is actually an arc of a circle that is 
; centered at the origin of the parent fractal.  The line appears 
; straight because only a tiny part of the whole circle is visi-
; ble.  The evaporation is spreading from the lower left toward 
; the upper right, and is controlled by changing the escape 
; radius, which is set by the imag(p3) parameter.  
; 
; To add a bit of spice, I rendered the scene with the inside set 
; to 'atan', though a couple of the other inside fills also do a 
; good job.
; 
; After careful study, I rated the image at a 7-1/2.  The calcula-
; tion time of under 1-1/2 minutes is speedy enough for all but 
; the most restless fractalists.  And as always, the finished 
; image can be seen on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; An enjoyable end-of-winter day prevailed here at Fractal Central 
; on Thursday, with sunny skies and a temperature of 54F 12C.  The 
; cats of F.C. were more concerned with the local pigeons than the 
; generous sun.
; 
; My day was as close to normal as days get.  With any luck at 
; all, tomorrow will be the same.  The next FOTD fractal will 
; appear in 24 hours or so.  Until then, take care, and time will 
; never come to a complete halt, but it will never stop slowing 
; down either.
