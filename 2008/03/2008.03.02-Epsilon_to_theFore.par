; FOTD -- March 03, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Sunday was not too busy here at Fractal Central.  When the 
; necessary work was finished, I gave myself a well-deserved break 
; in front of the TV.
; 
; Today's fire-and-brimstone image takes us to the minus-zexpe 
; fractal, where (-Z) is raised to the power of the number 
; epsilon.  This parent fractal resembles a Mandelbrot set that is 
; splitting at both its east and west ends.  Today's scene is 
; located in a valley inside a bud on the northwest shore of the 
; main bay of the parent.
; 
; Though today's image was created with the MandelbrotMiN formula, 
; there are actually an infinity of zexpe fractals to explore when 
; the MandelbrotBC formulas are used.  There are so many in fact 
; that I might make March the month of the zexpes.
; 
; I named today's image "Epsilon to the Fore" for no particular 
; reason.  I rated it a 6 because I could find little in it that 
; might be worth more.  The calculation time of 3-1/2 minutes is a 
; bit slow, but the wait can be avoided by viewing the finished 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Warm sun, only a few thin clouds and a temperature of 41F 5C 
; made Sunday rather pleasant here at Fractal Central.  The 
; fractal cats spent the day lounging in the sun and asking for 
; food.  I spent the day watching TV, which as long as it is not 
; carried to an extreme, can be quite a pleasant occupation.
; 
; The next glorious (IMO) FOTD fractal will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, don't claim there is no reason when you 
; don't know the reason, and don't be surprised if nothing turns 
; out to be everything.
