; FOTD -- March 07, 2008 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The rush continues here at Fractal Central, made more difficult 
; by a DSL modem that appears to be going kaput.
; 
; The problem with the missing FOTD's on the philofractal list is 
; that the mailing list apparently does not accept posts from AOL, 
; and with Mindspring having problems in the local area, I must 
; post some FOTD's through AOL.
; 
; Today's image shows a complex minibrot, thus the name.  Since I 
; found it almost without effort, I could give it no rating.  But 
; it's still a bit interesting to study.
; 
; The scene, with its mixture of total chaos and bits of semi-
; order, is located in a mis-shapen valley in yesterday's image.  
; The calculation time of 2 minutes will be inoffensive.  Perhaps 
; the most convenient way to view the image is to visit the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the fully-calculated image is posted.
; 
; A really nice day prevailed here at Fractal Central on Thursday, 
; with lots of sun and a temperature of 50F 10C.  Too bad we were 
; too busy to enjoy it.  The fractal cats did enjoy it however as 
; they spent most of the afternoon lounging in the sun streaming 
; in the front window.
; 
; As stated above, my day was quite busy.  But busy or not, the 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and wonder why I end the FOTD discussions with silly statements 
; and questions, such as: last night I dreamed of an elephant.  
; When I woke up, I realized that the elephant was a dream and had 
; therefore existed only in my mind.  But my mind is in my head 
; and my head is much too small to hold an elephant.  Where then 
; was the full-sized dream elephant located?
