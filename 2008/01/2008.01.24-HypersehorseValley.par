; FOTD -- January 24, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's circular image is a scene in Hyperseahorse Valley of the 
; Hypermandelbrot set.  I know that it looks nothing like a scene 
; in the familiar Seahorse Valley, but Hyperseahorse Valley is a 
; horse of an entirely different color.  The HyperMandelbrot 
; formula that created the image is the most enigmatic one in my 
; active list.  It appears to draw some of the Mandelbrot slices 
; that the type=hypercomplex formula misses, though actually, I am 
; not sure exactly what it does draw.
; 
; We know that these hyper-elements exist in the 8-dimensional 
; Hyperjulibrot figure because we see them in the images created 
; by the type=hypercomplexj formula, which draws a far greater 
; variety of slices than the type=hypercomplex formula, but some 
; of the images appear so unlikely that I cannot shake the 
; impression that they are artifacts of mathematical imprecision 
; rather than true fractals.  But whatever the images are, the 
; HyperMandelbrot formula is infinitely versatile, and I have 
; barely scratched the surface of what it can do.
; 
; The rating of an 8 is based mostly on the mathematical interest 
; of the image.  The artistic worth is merely average.  The name 
; "Hyperseahorse Valley" describes the location of the scene in 
; its parent fractal.
; 
; The calculation time is a disappointingly slow 1/2 hour even on 
; the super-speedster 2000mhz machine.  The calculation is so slow 
; because the periodicity must be turned off when working with the 
; HyperMandelbrot formula.  But all is not lost, for the completed 
; image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it may be enjoyed at leisure.
; 
; A fairly average but brilliantly sunny day here at Fractal 
; Central on Wednesday went un-noticed by the fractal cats, who 
; spent the day chasing each other up and down the hallway.  By 
; the time the evening tuna treat was served, they were totally 
; exhausted.
; 
; My day was fairly busy, but under control.  The next FOTD, 
; which will be another scene in Hyperseahorse Valley, will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and what the heck 
; are those 'rods' the UFO fans are talking about.  I doubt that 
; they are discussing the anatomy of the eye.
