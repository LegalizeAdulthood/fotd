; FOTD -- January 14, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we introduce a new formula, which draws the slices of the 
; Julibrot that are missed by the other odd-slice and oblique-
; slice formulas.  This formula draws only the oblique slices in 
; which there is no annoying stretching or skewing that must be 
; unstretched to be properly seen.
; 
; I named the image "New View of Seahorse", and indeed, this is 
; what it is.  In the image we see the entire Julia set of 
; Seahorse Valley as well as an enlarged view of a deep part of 
; the valley itself in the same frame.  And don't miss the peanut 
; holes where the vertical valley meets the edges of the Julia 
; parts of the image. 
; 
; The blank outer shape is immediately recognizable as one of the 
; Julia sets of Seahorse Valley, while the colorful vertical inner 
; stripe is a grossly enlarged but unstretched view of Seahorse 
; Valley as it appears at a depth of y=0.004.  The sides of the 
; valley are parallel not because it is stretched, but because it 
; is sliced at a depth where its sides actually are parallel.
; 
; The inner part of the image is enlarged for the same reason that 
; a 2-D slice of a circular cylinder can appear as anything from a 
; circle to a stripe with straight and parallel edges.  A cross-
; section of a similar 4-D cylinder is a sphere, and the cylinder 
; can be sliced by a 2-D plane in a direction that stretches the 
; projection equally in 2 dimensions.  Such a two-dimensional 
; stretching appears as a simple magnification.
; 
; I rated the image at a nominal 7, a fair rating for an image 
; with a rather slow calculation time of around 22 minutes.  But 
; why not forget about calculating by going to the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the image there?
; 
; Sunday turned out pleasant but a bit colder here at Fractal 
; Central.  The clouds that moved in during the afternoon held the 
; temperature to 43F 6C and led to a cold rain mixed with snow 
; after nightfall.  The fractal cats and myself as well spent most 
; of the day taking it easy in front of the TV.  The next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and I wonder 
; what happened to all the wonder I once felt as I read those 
; early books about the wonders of science and the physical world.
