; FOTD -- January 30, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene somewhere in HyperSeahorse Valley.  The 
; area of near total chaos at the center of attraction is the 
; remains of a perfectly normal M-set minibrot.  (To see the true 
; minibrot, reset all parameters to zero.)
; 
; As I continue to experiment with the HyperMandelbrot2 formula, I 
; am becoming more convinced that the images it draws are true 
; slices of the 4-D HyperMandelbrot set, and not mere artifacts. 
; In the true classic M-set version of today's image, there are 8 
; well-defined yellow-orangish elements surrounding the minibrot, 
; while in today's version, there are 14.  What has happened is 
; that the original 8 elements have each split into two, but two 
; of the split pairs overlap in such a manner that they both 
; appear as a single broader element, giving the impression of 
; only 14 elements in all.
; 
; Inside the space that once was the original minibrot, much the 
; same thing has happened, but the area is so chaotic that little 
; sense can be made of it.  I will continue to work with this 
; formula for a while, trying to figure it out.
; 
; The image is named "Minibrot Madness", which is a fair name for 
; it.  The rating of a 7 means that I think it is above average, 
; though not exceptional.  The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes 
; may be eliminated by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Tuesday began with freezing rain and icy pavements here at 
; Fractal Central.  But by midday the temperature rose above 
; freezing, and the rest of the day brought just plain rain.  The 
; fractal cats enjoyed the view for a while, then went to sleep.
; 
; My day was busy enough for satisfaction, but not too busy for a 
; fractal.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and it was hard enough to think in four dimensions.  
; Now we have eight dimensions to worry about.
