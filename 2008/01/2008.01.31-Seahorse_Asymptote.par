; 
; FOTD -- January 31, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today is the last day of January, and the last day of the theme 
; of January -- scenes in Seahorse Valley.  The tour has taken us 
; far afield, even into spaces of 8 dimensions to explore Hyper-
; Seahorse Valley.  Today's image focuses on a point very near the 
; point where the classic valley's two branches would reach the 
; X-axis if they were calculated to infinity.
; 
; I named the image "Seahorse Asymptote", a name that makes it 
; look like I know what I'm talking about when I discuss fractal 
; mathematics.  Then I gave it a rating of a 7, a rather generic 
; rating which means that, even though I can find nothing excep-
; tional in the image, I am not disappointed by it either.
; 
; It is immediately apparent that HyperSeahorse Valley is a far 
; more complex thing than classic Seahorse Valley.  The hyper 
; version of the valley has networks of arms spanning the empty 
; spaces between major elements that are far more intricate than 
; those in the more familiar valley.  Today's image is but a small 
; example of the intricacy lurking in the HyperSeahorse Valley.
; 
; It is also apparent that the image is actually a perturbed one.  
; Since the HyperMandelbrot set is 4-dimensional, the hyper-mini-
; brots within it must be 4-dimensional also.  And I assume they 
; are oriented in any possible direction within the 4-D Mandelbrot 
; set, just as the classic minibrots are oriented in all possible 
; directions in the classic 2-D M-set.  But who knows what variety 
; of perturbed slices this means are possible.
; 
; The theme for February will be HyperEast Valley of the Hyper 
; M-set.  I will not refer to it as HyperElephant Valley, since 
; elephants are already hyper enough without expletives added.  I 
; expect quite a few strange and perhaps entirely new things to 
; show up on the eastern fringes of the main hyperbay.
; 
; The calculation time of today's image is 6-1/2 minutes.  This 
; time may be cut by 1/3 by using one of the faster calculating 
; algorithms, but when this is done, there is always a chance that 
; some of the finer detail will be missed.  Considering all of the 
; above, the best way to see the complete scene intact is to visit 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it is or soon will be posted for instant gratification.
; 
; Overnight rain ended at daybreak Wednesday here at Fractal 
; Central, and the sky cleared by 9:00am, but the high winds of 
; 50mph (80kph) that prevailed for the rest of the day made the 
; temperature of 34F 1C feel far too chilly for comfort.  The 
; fractal cats agreed and rolled over on their shelf on top of 
; the radiator.
; 
; My day was fairly busy; tomorrow will likely be the same.  The 
; next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; be at one with the secular universe.
