; FOTD -- January 22, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows the outline of a large twisted minibrot in 
; East Valley of the Mandelbrot set, which in itself is nothing 
; unusual.  But inside this East Valley minibrot lies a smaller 
; minibrot from Seahorse Valley, which at first is quite puzzling.
; 
; The puzzle is solved when we see that the image was created by 
; the type=hypercomplex formula, which draws four-dimensional 
; Mandeloids consisting of two overlapping classic M-sets.  By 
; changing the cj and ck parameters, the two sets may be made to 
; overlap at any two points chosen.  Today's parent fractal was 
; drawn with East Valley overlapping Seahorse Valley in such a way 
; that a small Seahorse Valley minibrot shows through a larger 
; minibrot in East valley.
; 
; (The c and ci parameters of the formula are fixed to the screen 
; and cannot be changed, but the z, zi, zj, zk axes are all perpen-
; dicular to the screen.  It would be nice to have a way to 
; perturb the images in these four directions, and also to rotate 
; the orientation of the images through the entire 4-D Mandeloid.)
; 
; Since it took a bit of effort to find the overlapping midgets, I 
; decided to add an extra point to the rating in recognition of my 
; effort.  The image itself is perhaps a bit above average, though 
; similar images have been seen in some earlier FOTD's.
; 
; The name "Minibrot Minibrot" accurately describes the image.  
; The rather slow calculation time of 5-3/4 minutes is due to the 
; maxiter of 14400, but it was needed to get full definition 
; inside the outer minibrot.  And all but a minute or so of this 
; time may be saved by viewing the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Full sun could not offset a temperature of only 25F -4C here at 
; Fractal Central on Monday.  The fractal cats avoided the more 
; drafty windows to keep warm on their shelf by the window over 
; the radiator.
; 
; My M.L.K. holiday was reasonably slow.  The next FOTD will come 
; from nowhere in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if free 
; will is but an illusion, why is it such a convincing one?
