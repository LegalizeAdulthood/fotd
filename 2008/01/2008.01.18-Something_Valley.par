; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is named "Something Valley".  I gave it this 
; name because I'm not sure which type of valley it lies in.  It's 
; parent valley is kind of like a Seahorse Valley, but it's on the 
; east side of the parent fractal's main bay.  And it's kind of 
; like an East Valley, but there are two of it.
; 
; But regardless of what one calls the parent valley, the minibrot 
; in the image betrays the fact that the exponent of Z is between 
; 2 and 3.  In fact, the exponent is 2.5, and to make matters even 
; more confusing, it is not Z being iterated, but negative Z.
; 
; With so much confusion floating around, I could hardly give the 
; image a proper rating.  And the calculation time is a frustrat-
; ingly slow 18-1/4 minutes even on the P4-2000mhz fireball.
; 
; With all this in mind, I recommend that all interested fractal 
; fans exercise their free will by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the moderately impressive finished product there.
; 
; As for the problem of free will, I doubt that God's image can be 
; much damaged by the lack of or existence of human free will.  To 
; me, the paradoxes raised by God's assumed nature merely show how 
; insufficient are the God-images created by the infinitesimal 
; imaginations of puzzled theologians, which reduce the creating 
; power to the status of a glorified human being.
; 
; Light snow fell all day Thursday here at Fractal Central in 
; central Pennsylvania, but the temperature remained just above 
; freezing and the snow melted on the pavement.  Only on the grass 
; did a measly 1-inch (2.5cm) pile up.  The fractal cats were fas-
; cinated for a time by the big sloppy flakes, but soon grew bored 
; with the show and started chasing each other up and down the 
; long F.C. hallway.
; 
; My work-day was pleasingly average, as average as the day's 
; fractal.  And the next fractal, hopefully considerably above 
; average, will be posted to this very same list in a short 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and exercise your free will.
