; FOTD -- November 19, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have heard it said that life is the most complex thing in the 
; universe.  I hate to throw doubt on that near-mystical state-
; ment, but with their infinite complexity, fractals are more 
; complex than even physical life.
; 
; As far as I can tell, today's image is not alive however.  It is 
; only a fractal.  This is not as rational as it might seem, for 
; who can say with absolute certainty that fractals, in all their 
; mathematical complexity, cannot be alive?  The quantum theory of 
; the sub-atomic realm is basically composed of number gyrations, 
; and living things are composed of that sub-atomic stuff.
; 
; The name I gave today's image is "Iterative Zygote", which needs 
; some explanation.  Before a human is an adult, he is a child.  
; Before that he is an infant, a fetus, an embryo, and first of 
; all, a zygote, which is a fertilized egg.  Today's image reminds 
; me of a fertilized egg just starting the countless divisions 
; that will culminate (hopefully) in a mature adult human being.
; 
; The image is located in the Seahorse Valley area of the large 
; minibrot on the main negative spike of the parent fractal, which 
; is a grossly enlarged Mandelbrot set.  The tiny blips on the 
; hairline arms and major arms surrounding and extending from the 
; 16-lobed minibrot in the image are actually small Z^2+C Seahorse 
; Valley Julia sets filled with similar 16-lobed minibrots.  Some 
; of the arms terminate in very curious fragments of Julia sets, 
; while other arms simply die out into infinity.
; 
; I was so impressed when I found such a picturesque minibrot of 
; order-17 that I rated the image at an 8.  The fireball calcula-
; tion time of a mere 19 seconds is also quite impressive.  And as 
; always, the already-calculated image is posted on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The fractal cats soundly disapproved of the clouds and freezing 
; temperature of 32F 0C that prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Tuesday.  The occasional heavy showers of snow, which left a 1cm 
; coating on the grass, did nothing to help things.
; 
; My day was about average.  Tomorrow will likely be the same.  
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and when Sister Mary Thomas told me my questions about God 
; were childish, and told me to sit down and shut up, I reminded 
; her that the bible says we must become like children before we 
; can get into heaven.
