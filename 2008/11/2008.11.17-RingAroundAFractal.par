; FOTD -- November 17, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In yesterday's discussion I said that the image is located in 
; the interior of the main bay of its parent fractal.  But I made 
; a mistake.  Yesterday's image is actually located in an island 
; near the distorted northwest shore line of a small minibrot on 
; the main spike of its parent fractal.  I'll try not to make such 
; a non-apocalyptic error again.
; 
; Today's image, with its overlapping and squashed minibrots of 
; order 17, is much the same as yesterday's, but with more vibrant 
; colors.  It is located in a similar location in its parent 
; fractal.
; 
; After a modicum of thought, I named today's image "Ring Around a 
; Fractal".  Then, because I felt like it, I rated the image at a 
; reasonably glorious 7.
; 
; The calculation time of 6-1/3 minutes will vary according to the 
; speed of the individual machine.  The time required to hop out 
; to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; will be shorter in almost all cases.
; 
; Heavy clouds and blustery winds made the temperature of 43F 6C 
; feel colder than it actually was here at Fractal Central on 
; Sunday.  The fractal cats, who have been getting very little sun 
; lately, continued to complain.  A saucer of half-and-half and a 
; teaspoon of tuna eased their disappointment.
; 
; My day was good enough, and if all goes well, tomorrow will be 
; even better.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and if the current economic 'crisis' was caused 
; by having too much cheap credit available, how can it be cured 
; by getting even more credit flowing?
