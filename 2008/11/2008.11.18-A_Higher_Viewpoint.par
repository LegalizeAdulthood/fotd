; 
; FOTD -- November 18, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a downright attractive minibrot of order 17, 
; which means it has 16 interior lobes with 17-part symmetry 
; surrounding it.  It might not be fully worth the rating of an 8, 
; but I gave this rating because it's a surprise to see something 
; this interesting and attractive in the range of Z^17 fractals.  
; I was tempted to add an extra half-point for my coloring skill, 
; but my humility made me decide against it.
; 
; The name "A Higher Viewpoint" refers to the high-order circular 
; minibrot that fills the center of the image.  The mathtolerance 
; entry in the parameter file is necessary because of the extreme 
; magnitude of the image, which is already causing a breakdown of 
; resolution.
; 
; The scene is simply a blow-up of a minibrot in the center of the 
; kind of fractal objects that have appeared in the FOTD's of the 
; past two days.  But this will be the last of the series.  I must 
; be moving on.  An infinity of fractals lies out there, waiting 
; to be discovered.
; 
; The calculation time of 31 seconds is lightning fast, though the 
; result may not be quite as shocking.  As always, the calculating 
; may be avoided by surfing to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and enjoying the finished image there.
; 
;                *****Philosophy alert!*****
; 
; With extra spare time on Monday, my philosophical energies came 
; to life.  I thought of how unlikely it is that I should be here 
; at this particular time and place, or how unlikely that I should 
; ever have existed at all.  I'll not go through the mathematical 
; calculation, but as I figure it, the chance of myself, (and of 
; everyone else as well), ever coming into existence is exactly 
; zero.
; 
; It's impossible for any one of us to be here, yet here we all 
; are.  It's a miracle that reason cannot explain, a miracle so 
; subtle and omnipresent that even its existence is difficult to 
; recognize.
; 
; The high priests of science are helpless to explain it.  They 
; brush aside talk of the miracle by claiming it is a childish way 
; of thinking.  The high priests of philosophy are also helpless.  
; They claim that, however unlikely it may be, we are here now, 
; and this makes the probability of our existence 100 percent.
; 
; The high priests of religion are a bit more able to offer an 
; explanation.  They claim that each of us is here because God had 
; each of us in mind for all eternity before He manifested us as 
; individuals.  However, this is only a different way of stating 
; the miracle.  But religion at least goes one step beyond science 
; when it claims that God will never forget us.  The problem with 
; the religious explanation is that God has concealed Himself so 
; deeply that many of us doubt He is there at all.
; 
; At this point it is best that, as Sister Mary Thomas told me in 
; the seventh grade, I should sit down and shut up.
; 
;              *****Weather and Cat report*****
; 
; Clouds and sun alternated here at Fractal central on Monday, 
; while the temperature reached only 41F 5C.  The fractal cats 
; complained when the clouds predominated during their afternoon 
; nap in the southwest window.  A little tuna and coffee cream 
; ended their complaints.
; 
; My day was unexpectedly slow.  And tomorrow has a very good 
; chance of being exactly the same.  The next FOTD fractal will be 
; posted for all the world to admire in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and every one of us is a necessary part of the 
; complete universe.
