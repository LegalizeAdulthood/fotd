; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- November 12, 2008 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yes, there is a minibrot in the lower part of today's image, and 
; there is a less obvious upside-down cubic bud in the upper part. 
; And this has anything to do with the number of iterations a par-
; ticular point takes before reaching an arbitrary distance from 
; the origin.
; 
; Escape time is not involved in the image because it consists 
; entirely of trapped points that have been made visible by the 
; 'bof60' inside fill, which colors the points according to how 
; close to the origin they come in their trapped wanderings.
; 
; The most amazing thing is that the small Mandelbrot set and the 
; ghostly cubic bud are actually there at all.  The more I work 
; with fractals, the more I come to see the Mandelbrot set as a 
; universal presence, created in potential by mankind when he 
; invented and defined complex numbers.
; 
; With all this in mind, I named today's image "Mystical Mini-
; brots".  Of course, only one obvious minibrot exists in the 
; image, but I see other brilliant yellow points scattered about. 
; Could these be other minibrots?  Only a further investigation 
; will tell.
; 
; The rating of an 8-1/2 includes a self-awarded half point for 
; the effort I expended in getting smooth gradation with only 256 
; colors.  The calculation time of 3-3/4 minutes is extrapolated 
; from the 14 minutes the image took to run on the P200 machine.  
; The 2000mhz unit is still out of action.
; 
; The image may also be seen and hopefully enjoyed by surfing out 
; to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing it without effort there.
; 
; Leaden gray skies and a chilly temperature of 43F 6C made 
; Tuesday a rather forgettable day here at Fractal Central.  The 
; fractal cats again complained when the sun failed to appear as 
; scheduled on their shelf in the southwest window.  I eased my 
; own gloom by treating myself to a genuine New York egg cream.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, a fact that hardly 
; needs to be repeated.  Until that (IMO) wonderful moment, take 
; care, and choose wisely.
