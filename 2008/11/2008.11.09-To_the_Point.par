; FOTD -- November 09, 2008 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The lateness of today's FOTD tells that things were busy here at 
; F.C. on Saturday, as a couple more customers called in, needing 
; quick changes on their jobs as a result of the recent election.  
; This left but little time for work on the glorious (IMO) FOTD.
; 
; I could give today's image no rating because it's not a finished 
; image, it's only a study in getting a smooth color gradient from 
; a palette of 256 colors.  But the result turned out good enough 
; to qualify as the FOTD for November 9.
; 
; The image shows parts of both Seahorse Valley and East Valley.  
; The solid area at the left is part of Seahorse Valley of the 
; Mandelbrot set, while the sharp spike shooting in from the right 
; and stabbing into Seahorse Valley is actually a part of the East 
; Valley of a second Mandelbrot set, which partially overlaps the 
; first M-set.
; 
; The 2 overlapping M-sets form a four-dimensional unit that can 
; be explored in limited orientations by the hypercomplex formula. 
; There are entries for four parameters in the formula, but only 
; the last two have any effect on the image.  Apparently the form-
; ula is still in an unfinished condition.
; 
; But finished or not, the formula creates some images that can be 
; quite unusual, with elephants eating seahorses, and minibrots 
; filled with smaller minibrots.  I have written several formulas 
; that are supposed to expand the range of the hypercomplex form-
; ula, though they produce such weird results that I'm not sure 
; exactly what they do.
; 
; The name "To the Point" refers to the point of East Valley 
; jabbing into Seahorse Valley from the right.  The calculation 
; time of 2 minutes will cause no impatience.  And the finished 
; image will soon be posted to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; but due to the odd hour of this posting, there may be a delay of 
; several hours before Paul gets it calculated and posted.
; 
; Early morning rain was followed by afternoon sun here at Fractal 
; Central on Saturday.  The fractal cats enjoyed the sun to the 
; maximum.  The temperature rose to 64F 18C by 2pm, but by sunset, 
; just before 5pm, it had dropped to 52F 11C.  As stated earlier, 
; my day was busier than expected.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in around 12 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and wait for the new world with bated but not abated 
; breath.
