; FOTD -- May 17, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; On a recent visit with fractal lady to one of the nearby antique 
; emporiums, I came upon an old book printed in 1856 and titled 
; "Wells's Familiar Science".  Being in a state of moderate bore-
; dom, I opened it and found it to be a book of popularized 
; science as science was understood in the middle of the 19th 
; Century, with the text presented in a question-and-answer 
; format.  Since the price was quite reasonable, I purchased the 
; book, which now lies on the desk beside me.  I have yet to read 
; it thoroughly, but the small part I have browsed through is 
; quite interesting.
; 
; It is surprising how much our scientific understanding of some 
; phenomena have changed in the past 152 years, and how little our 
; understanding of other phenomena have changed.  The velocity of 
; light is given as around 190,000 miles per second, a bit too 
; fast.  And there is a section explaining the constitution of the 
; so-called luminiferous ether.  One of the greatest questions 
; about light at the time was what happens to it when it is 
; absorbed by a dark body.  The source of the sun's energy was a 
; complete mystery, though it was speculated that the sun emits 
; heat and light as a bell emits sound when it is struck, without 
; exhausting its reservoir of sound.
; 
; I'll relate further interesting tidbits from the book as I come 
; upon them, but now we have a fractal to investigate.  The 
; fractal was generated by calculating the formula Z^(1.375)+C at 
; a level 1.375 units down the logarithmic ladder, while applying 
; no function.
; 
; I'll not describe the parent fractal in much detail.  It is 
; basically a distorted Mandeloid standing on its head.  Today's 
; unusually gaudy scene is located in a small valley near the 
; parent fractal's 'nose'.
; 
; I gave the image the rather poetic name, "Under the Equinox", 
; though I have since forgotten what moved me to give it this 
; name.  The rating of an 8 might be a bit optimistic, especially 
; for an image with no true minibrot at its center.  The central 
; blue triangle is no real substitute.
; 
; To add some extra zip, the image was rendered with the outside 
; set to 'tdis'.  The calculation time of 16-1/3 minutes is 
; admittedly slow, but instant gratification is available on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Steady rain all day and a very un-springlike temperature of 52F 
; 11C made Friday a day to be forgotten here at Fractal Central.  
; The duo of fractal cats watched the dripping water for a few 
; minutes, then viciously attacked their catnip rats and mice.  My 
; day was close to normal.
; 
; The next semi-glorious FOTD will appear in 24 hours or so.  
; Until then, take care, and don't be too sure of things you're 
; not sure of.
