; FOTD -- May 04, 2008 (What Rating?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To create today's image, I dredged up an old formula that I have 
; not worked with for quite a while.  I forget what the formula 
; was originally supposed to do, but that doesn't matter.  As 
; today's image shows, the formula creates some strikingly unusual 
; scenes, fractal or not.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is not a fractal.  It's only 
; an empty circle.  Regardless of how the parameters and function 
; are tweaked, the Mystic2 formula draws nothing but flat black 
; empty circles.  But when those circles are rendered with an 
; active inside fill and the parameters are set just right, all 
; kinds of strange things happen.  Today's image is but a tiny 
; part of the unexpected things that can happen invisibly inside 
; an empty circle.
; 
; I named today's image "Where's the Fractal?".  Actually I'm not 
; sure that it is technically a fractal, consisting entirely as it 
; does of 'inside' stuff.  But it has enough fractal characteris-
; tics to pass muster as the FOTD for May 4.
; 
; Since I'm not sure that the image actually is a fractal, how 
; could I rate it?  If I were pressed to give it a rating however, 
; I would choose something around an 8.
; 
; The 1-2/3 minute calculation time should cause no grief out 
; there in fractal land.  And with the finished image posted on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; satisfaction is virtually guaranteed.
; 
; The sky was cloudy here at Fractal Central on Saturday, and the 
; temperature never rose above 61F 16C, but the rain held off 
; until 7pm, when all the outside stiff had been completed.  The 
; fractal cats, never ones to be worried about weather, spent 
; the day guarding their chosen catnip rats.
; 
; My day was uneventful.  If tomorrow is the same, I'll consider 
; the week-end a success.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and to be considered the greatest thinker 
; in history, find the answer to the riddle of the universe.
