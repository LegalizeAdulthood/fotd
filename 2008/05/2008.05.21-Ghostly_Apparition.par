; FOTD -- May 21, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "Ghostly Apparition" because the minibrot 
; near its center barely exists.  The spooky apparition manifested 
; itself when I combined 6 negative parts of Z^(-1.66) with one 
; negative part of Z^(-6.6) and added (1/C).
; 
; The parent fractal consists of a number of irregularly shaped 
; bays surrounded by countless interesting nooks and crannies to 
; explore.  But instead of exploring the nooks, I checked a blob 
; of material near the inside center of the fractal, near the 
; point where two large bays appear to merge.
; 
; I found there a strange arrangement of bits and pieces, which 
; when enlarged formed the skeletal outline of a ghostly minibrot. 
; To return the ghost to life, I rendered the scene with the 
; inside set to 'bof60' and the outside set to 'atan'.  The result 
; is an image different enough to rate a 8.
; 
; The calculation time of under 11 seconds can hardly be a burden. 
; And the already-calculated image is posted for instant viewing 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; About a week ago I told of a 152-year-old book I recently found 
; in a local antique emporium while tagging along with fractal 
; lady on one of her antiquing expeditions.  The book is a popular-
; ized presentation of the scientific and practical knowledge of 
; the day.
; 
; Some of the old ideas are now absurdly, almost comically wrong, 
; while others are still totally accurate, and still others, such 
; as how to shoe a horse, and how to bank a fire, are still true, 
; but of importance to very few.
; 
; While idly turning the weathered and stained pages, I sometimes 
; wonder how our current scientific and practical ideas will seem 
; 152 years from today.  Will our descendants laugh at our futile 
; search for a 'theory of (almost) everything'?  Will they wonder 
; how we could possibly fail to grasp the obvious (to them) mean-
; ing of our own quantum discoveries?  Will they shake their heads 
; at our silly addiction to 'cell phones' and the rhythmic noise 
; we now call music?  But most frightening of all, are we now see-
; ing the beginning of a new era of techno-civilization or is it 
; actually the start of a neo-dark age?
; 
; Rain fell steadily all morning and most of the afternoon here at 
; Fractal Central on Tuesday, while the temperature hovered just 
; above 50F 10C.  The fractal cats spent the day looking for the 
; catnip rat, which they have somehow misplaced.
; 
; I spent the day working and thinking deep (IMO) thoughts.  The 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours or so.  Until then, take 
; care, and I had a clever closing comment in mind, but I forgot 
; to write it down, and have since forgotten it.
