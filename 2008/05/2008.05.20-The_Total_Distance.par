; FOTD -- May 20, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After all these years, I think I might be growing bored with 
; quadratic minibrots.  But despite my best efforts, the 
; ubiquitous things keep coming.  Today's little fellow lies in 
; the parent fractal generated when negative Z^(1.25) is combined 
; with negative Z^(3) and (C) is added.
; 
; This parent is shaped somewhat like a lopsided eggplant, with 
; some pretty ordinary Mandelbrot buds on the east shore but a 
; more chaotic landscape along the west shore.  A very prominent 
; minibrot lies a bit inland on the western shore, and today's 
; scene is located in the East Valley of this minibrot.
; 
; Today's FOTD is a full five point improvement over yesterday's.  
; But yesterday's image rated only an abysmal 1, which means that 
; today's rates a 6, a rating that, while not too bad, is nothing 
; to celebrate either.
; 
; I named the image "The Total Distance" since it was rendered 
; with the 'outside' set to 'tdis', which colors the points 
; according to the total distance they travel before escaping 
; beyond the specified bailout radius.
; 
; Perhaps the best thing about the image is its speedy calculation 
; time of 1-1/4 minutes.  And the next best thing is that the pre-
; rendered image is available for immediate viewing on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; As the FOTD progresses, I find myself getting more and more 
; involved in the philosophical aspects of fractals, which are so 
; obviously made of numbers.  But after trying to get through a 
; few advanced books of quantum theory, I find that atoms are 
; made of numbers also.  And I wonder whether the quantum world 
; determines the numbers or the numbers determine the quantum.
; 
; I guess we might soon have to admit that the world, including 
; ourselves is composed of numbers, which begs the question 'what 
; are numbers?'  Sometimes I wish I could return to the days when 
; things were so much simpler, when I thought the real world was 
; really real and atoms were tiny solar systems made of little 
; orbiting particle-energy things which existed even when no one 
; was looking.
; 
; But like my faith in the mysterious invisible things of 
; religion, my faith in the equally mysterious invisible things of 
; science has vanished also.  In my opinion, Santa Claus is 
; unreal, God as described by religion is unreal, and atoms as 
; described by science are unreal also.  If it's all a dream 
; however, who or what is doing the dreaming?
; 
; Chilly and blustery conditions made Monday quite unseasonal here 
; at Fractal Central.  The temperature of 55F 13C and brisk winds 
; made it feel more like mid-March than mid-May.  The fractal cats 
; watched the scudding clouds for a few minutes before they got 
; into a spat over who would claim the best window shelf.  Cassie 
; won the dispute with a good slap on Nicholas' head.
; 
; My day (Monday the 19th) was unexpectedly busy, and tomorrow 
; (Tuesday the 20th) will be just as busy.  But despite the rush, 
; there will most likely be another FOTD posted in 24 hours.  At 
; this time, I'll make no predictions as to its potential quality. 
; Until then, take care, and sometimes putting it off until later 
; is the best choice.
