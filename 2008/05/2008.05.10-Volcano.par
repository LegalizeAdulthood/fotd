; FOTD -- May 10, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Once again, the philosophy, or whatever it is, leads off the 
; discussion.  To reach the fractal stuff, skip ahead seven para-
; graphs.
; 
; I recently watched a 'skeptical' (read Atheist) show supposedly 
; devoted to debunking paranormal claims.  Not surprisingly, after 
; demonstrating that Madam Zucchini, the local psychic, could not 
; predict the future, the topic soon wandered to the so-called 
; 'delusion' of spiritual life after death.
; 
; During the entire show, the announcer repeatedly stated that 
; extraordinary claims, such as the existence of spirits of the 
; dead, demand extraordinary evidence.
; 
; So far, so good, but the point of the program was to show the 
; viewers that ghosts are nothing more than images created in the 
; brain and mistaken for reality, or else outright fabrications.
; 
; But with legends of ghosts, etc. existing in every culture on 
; earth, and with many of those who see ghosts aware of the possi-
; bility of mistaking a hallucination for reality, the claim that 
; absolutely everyone who claims to see a ghost is either mistaken 
; or inventing the story is in itself quite extraordinary.  Accor-
; ding to the 'skeptics' own words, this claim also must demand 
; extraordinary evidence.
; 
; But such evidence cannot be found.  The high (or low) point of 
; the show came at the end, when the announcer said that, since it 
; is impossible to prove a negative, there can be no scientific 
; evidence that ghosts do not exist.  And since there is so much 
; admittedly non-scientific and anecdotal evidence that ghosts do 
; exist, this totally negated the entire message of the show.
; 
; The only thing the show convinced me of is that skeptics and 
; Atheists are out to convert others to their belief system.  IMO, 
; this makes Atheism as much a religion as any other religion on 
; earth.
; 
; And now on to the fractal stuff.
; 
; In today's image I see a picture of an erupting volcano as 
; viewed from a few thousand feet directly above the crater, 
; complete with billowing clouds of ash, zig-zagging lightning, 
; and oozing lava.  The name 'Volcano" is quite appropriate, since 
; a volcano is currently erupting in Chile.
; 
; The formula behind all the volcanic action adds straight Z to 
; Z^(2.1) to create a parent fractal that is quite hard to 
; describe.  Perhaps the best description would be a disembodied 
; Mandelbrot main bay with two lopsided sausages where the single 
; large bud should be.
; 
; A large field of scattered zig-zagging debris lies off to the 
; west of the two sausages, with today's image located very deep 
; in one of these zig-zags.  It lies so deep in fact that the 
; resolution is starting to break down.  Luckily, this is hardly 
; noticeable, but I did include the mathtolerance entry to assure 
; that the parameter file calculates at the correct magnitude.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is arbitrary, but the calculation time of 42 
; seconds is as fast as a photon.  As always, the finished image 
; is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; An all day rain and temperature of 54F 12C made Friday less than 
; ideal here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats took one look 
; at the water running down the sidewalk and returned to attack 
; their catnip rats.
; 
; My day was average.  With any luck at all tomorrow will be the 
; same.  Look for the next FOTD in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and if I had not seen a ghost, I would never believe that 
; they exist.
