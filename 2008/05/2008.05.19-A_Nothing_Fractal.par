; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Warning:  I'm in a strange mood today, so have fun.
; 
; Since today's fractal image is nothing to write home about, or 
; to write about anywhere else for that matter, I might as well 
; start the discussion by broaching the topic of the nature of 
; the mind and reality.  Only a fool would claim it is foolish to 
; waste time discussing the nature of reality, a problem which can 
; never be solved.  At the same time, only a fool would actually 
; waste his time writing about it.  Since I must be a fool, I will 
; discuss the problem.  But expect no solution.
; 
; One thing I think is certain is that my awareness exists, though 
; sometimes I doubt even this.  I never ask myself where my 
; awareness goes when I go to sleep.  Only a fool would do so.  
; But for countless days it has been there to greet me when I wake 
; up in the morning, unchanged from the evening before.
; 
; I am not foolish enough to wonder what it is that stays the same 
; while the material of my brain as well as my thoughts constantly 
; change, but it might be a soul, whatever that is.  Oops, I just 
; forgot that souls are supposed to be a by-product of the body, 
; so this is no answer either.
; 
; Let's make an assumption -- whatever my self-aware mind is, it 
; does indeed exist, and it is somehow miraculously generated by 
; the electro-chemical interactions of the neurons in my brain.  
; If this is so, the question now becomes how unconscious matter 
; can create self-awareness.  I have read over a dozen books about 
; this miracle, but I am no closer to grasping what is going on in 
; my brain than I am to grasping what is going on in the quantum 
; realm.  But one thing for certain is that speculation among the 
; cognitive scientists is currently rampant.  One of the most 
; recent theories is that I am a strange loop, whatever a strange 
; loop is.
; 
; I rather enjoy being a strange loop.  It's rather like being a 
; fractal, and if I am a fractal, then everything else must also 
; be one.  The universe is a big fractal, with God doing the 
; iterating.  (I assume He uses Fractint.)  Oops, I forgot that 
; God is supposed to be only a feel-good superstition.
; 
; I have no idea where I'm going with this, so I guess it's time 
; to turn to the fractal.  As for that fractal, it's a disgrace.  
; It's the first FOTD ever to rate a humiliating 1.  And it 
; doesn't even deserve its 1.  It actually deserves a zero.
; 
; The image lies in the parent fractal created by the formula 
; Z^(1.618)+C when it is calculated at ground level of the log 
; ladder with no function applied.
; 
; I named the image "A Nothing Fractal", which is exactly what it 
; is.
; 
; At least the calculation time is a mercifully brief 41 seconds.  
; And the finished image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Morning rain here at Fractal Central on Sunday was followed by 
; early afternoon sun and late afternoon rain squalls, while the 
; temperature hung around a very chilly 61F 16C.  The fractal cats 
; noticed the rain, but were more interested in the pigeons 
; scrounging for sustenance on the sidewalk.
; 
; For me the day was busier than I would have preferred, but not 
; as busy as I might have feared.  The next FOTD will be along, if 
; I feel like doing one, in 24 hours or so.  Until then, take 
; care, and if nothing is really real, are illusions real?
