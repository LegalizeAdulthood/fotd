; FOTD -- May 07, 2008 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today, I'm in more of a philosophical mood than a fractal mood, 
; so pardon me if I make a little diversion before getting to the 
; Fractal of the Day.  Those bored with opinionated philosophy may 
; skip to the ninth paragraph.
; 
; In the distant past, when I was just learning about the world, I 
; read every book of popularized science that I could get my hands 
; on.  The books answered most of my childhood questions such as: 
; how far away are the stars?, why does the wind blow?, how old is 
; the earth?, what is the tallest mountain and the tallest water-
; fall?, (I found it was not Yosemite), where does lava come 
; from?, where do meteors come from?  My list of questions was 
; nearly endless, and I found the answers to most of them in the 
; 'science' books I read.
; 
; But now that I am closer to the other end of life, my list of 
; questions has changed, and I feel that the science I once almost 
; worshipped has let me down.  True, my questions are now more 
; difficult.  My head is filled by unanswered and perhaps unans-
; werable questions, such as: what is the meaning of life?, where 
; did our unique individualities come from and where will we go 
; from here?
; 
; Answers such as: the meaning of life is 42, (ask a deaf person 
; what 42 means), we came from oblivion and we will return to 
; oblivion, are merely silly.  Equally silly are attempts to avoid 
; answering the questions by blaming our genes for programming us 
; to invent such ultimately meaningless questions.
; 
; But perhaps the most evasive and offensive thing I have heard is 
; the standard Atheistic reply that men lack the courage to accept 
; the harsh reality that deep inside they fear is actually true.  
; This is perhaps the most destructive philosophy ever embraced by 
; a thankfully small segment of humanity.  Many years ago I tried 
; and discarded such nihilistic Atheism, which like conventional 
; dogmatic religion, raises more questions than it answers.  (An 
; Atheist once actually said to me that the physical universe is 
; his god and science is his religion.)
; 
; Perhaps it would be better for those running the oversized scien-
; tific corporation to stop wasting such immense sums of money in 
; search of useless dream things such as 'higgs particles' and a 
; 'theory of everything', and pause to find the courage to address 
; the questions that people are really concerned about.
; 
; Does all this mean that I believe in the supernatural?  Maybe it 
; does, or maybe not.  But if things seem to be pointing in that 
; direction, I will not curl into a ball and hide in the corner in 
; fear of the unknown.
; 
; I make no claims of having any answers, but of one thing I am 
; certain.  I have so far found even more unanswered questions in 
; fractals than in the so-called 'real' world.
; 
; Today's fractal image, by the way, lies in the parent that 
; results when the formula Z^(2.01+0.03i)+C is iterated six levels 
; up the complex logarithmic ladder.
; 
; This parent fractal is basically a distorted Mandelbrot set 
; rotated so that its main spike faces southwest.  Today's scene 
; showing an equally distorted minibrot is located in the much-
; broadened east branch of the valley setting off the large 
; period-3 north bud.
; 
; Since the image shows a minibrot surrounded by nothing much of 
; interest, I could rate it at only a 5.  The name "Something 
; Imaginary" refers to the imaginary part of the exponent of Z.
; 
; The calculation time of 4 minutes is a bit longer than I would 
; have preferred, but still well within reason.  The most reason-
; able way of all to view the image however is to visit the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and enjoy it as much as possible there.
; 
; A day that could have been perfect was spoiled by a series of 
; light showers in the early afternoon here at Fractal Central on 
; Tuesday.  But despite the rain, the temperature reached 72F 22C, 
; earning the approval of the fractal cats.
; 
; My day was slow enough to be satisfactory, but not good enough 
; to be exceptional.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours, when 
; perhaps I can get out of this fractal rut.  Until then, take 
; care, and I once was sure, but now I'm puzzled.
