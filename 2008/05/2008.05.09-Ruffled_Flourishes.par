; FOTD -- May 09, 2008 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The philosophical blather continues today.  Those who are not 
; philosophically inclined will find the start of the fractal 
; stuff nine paragraphs below.
; 
; Though materialism (Is it now called energism?) was more popular 
; in the 19th Century, I still sometimes hear claims that physical 
; matter is the ultimate reality.  I find this philosophy naive 
; almost to the point of comedy, but some still hold fast to it.
; 
; The first question that comes to mind is, 'what is physical 
; matter made of?'  The answer of course is atoms.  But the 
; regress continues, for then we ask, 'what are atoms made of?' 
; and find they are made of sub-atomic particles, mostly protons, 
; neutrons and electrons.
; 
; If we dare go farther and ask what protons are made of, we find 
; they are made of quarks, but when an electron gets into the mix, 
; the proton becomes a neutron.  Only a fool would ask what quarks 
; are made of, but if he did, he would probably find they are 
; currently thought to be multi-dimensional vibrations of super-
; strings or membranes.  And I assume the strings and membranes 
; are made of pure energy.
; 
; With the electron, things are no better.  The electron has both 
; wave and particle aspects, as do all sub-atomic particles when 
; not observed.  When an electron is observed, it collapses for 
; the observer's convenience into whatever the observer is looking 
; for.  When it spins, and all electrons do something called spin, 
; it must make two full turns before presenting the same face to 
; the observer.  And anyone foolish enough to ask what is waving 
; when the electron is in its wave mode will find that nothing is 
; waving.
; 
; I only hope no one asks how nothing can actually start waving 
; and thereby become something.  The last I heard, it is logically
; impossible for something to come from nothing.
; 
; Mass and energy have been shown to be different forms of the 
; same thing.  Mass is a parcel of energy tied into a knot.  But 
; what the heck is energy?  Yes, we know it is the ability to do 
; work, but what is it made of?  No one seems to know.  They say 
; the question is silly.  (And maybe it is!)
; 
; It appears we have come to the end of the line and answered 
; absolutely nothing.  Physical matter is not the ultimate 
; reality, nor are the atoms that matter is made from.  Sub-atomic 
; particles are even less real.  Energy is the ultimate reality, 
; and without invoking a god, no one has the slightest idea what 
; it is or where it comes from.  And if we invoke a supernatural 
; god, we must then ask where that god came from and what he, she 
; or it is made of.
; 
; Something is wrong somewhere in this dead-end line of thought.  
; Something, perhaps many things, or even everything we assume to 
; be a fact must be wrong.  But I have been searching for over 
; half a lifetime for the flaw.  Dogmatic religion has no answers, 
; equally dogmatic science has no answers, and dreamy-eyed mysti-
; cism, though it might have some answers, is as much a failure in 
; communicating those answers as are the quantum physicists at 
; communicating exactly what goes on down there.  All this leaves 
; the questioning segment of humanity lost in the wilderness, 
; which for all I know might be our natural predestined state.
; 
; Now as for today's fractal image, it rates a 6.  There have been 
; worse and there have been better.  I named it "Ruffled Flour-
; ishes", which has nothing to do with the chief of state.  It was 
; created when I subtracted 1/4 part of Z^3 from the Mandelbrot 
; set to produce a M-set rotated 180 degrees, with lots of extra 
; nooks and crannies (not crooks and nannies) along the X-axis.
; 
; Today's image is located in one of these extra crannies in the 
; East Valley area of the main M-set of its parent.  When rendered 
; in the usual manner, the image falls flat, so I have rendered 
; it with the outside set to 'tdis', which gives it just enough 
; life to make it worth being declared FOTD for May 09.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes is gloriously fast.  But 
; it would be even more glorious to surf over to the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and enjoy the finished image posted there.
; 
; Thursday started with light rain here at Fractal Central.  The 
; rain ended before noon however, leading to a cloudy bright 
; afternoon with a temperature of 73F 23C.  The fractal cats 
; enjoyed the weather from the comfort of their window seats.
; 
; My day was once again slow.  Who could ask for more?  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; my philosophical muse is still raging.  Also, if such a thing 
; as absolute truth exists, where does it lie and how do we 
; recognize it?
