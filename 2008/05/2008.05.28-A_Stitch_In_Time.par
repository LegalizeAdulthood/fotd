; FOTD -- May 29, 2008 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I saw on the news this morning that the cameras on the latest 
; Mars lander have picked up something in the distance that 
; suspiciously resembles an intelligently designed artifact.
; 
; I assume we'll soon be hearing that the artifact was left there 
; by aliens from Vega-3, who have been spying on earth from this 
; secret base on Mars, and neglected to clear all signs of their 
; presence when they returned to their home world to report that 
; the earth is ready to be invaded and conquered.
; 
; I am sorely disappointed.  I thought the space aliens were an 
; alliance from the yet-to-be-discovered third star in the Sirius 
; system and the fourth planet circling Procyon.  Whatever, I will 
; be watching the Pennsylvania skies very carefully in the days to 
; come.
; 
; And I can't help wondering whether fractals exist in the 
; universe as perceived by the aliens.  I often wonder whether 
; fractals really do exist, or are mere inventions of the human 
; fancy.  Since aliens, by definition, must lack human minds, 
; fractals might not exist in their world.
; 
; One thing certain however is that something exists somewhere, 
; for today's FOTD is a picture of it.  The parent fractal was 
; created when I mixed various negative portions of Z^(-1.732) 
; and Z^(-7.32), then added (1/C).  This parent fractal is little 
; more than a chaotic mish-mash of fractal stuff, but even so it 
; has at least some worth.
; 
; Today's scene lies at the terminal of a filament extending from 
; a small bud in the southernmost part of the parent.  Most of the 
; artistic effect is a result of my quasi-skilled coloring efforts. 
; The extreme magnitude of 4.5*(10^12) requires the mathtolerance 
; entry.
; 
; The rating of 7-1/2 includes 1/2 point for my coloring.  The name 
; "A Stitch In Time" has nothing at all to do with the image, but 
; then again I have no idea what "the tropic of Sir Galahad" has to 
; do with "the tin man", yet it's in the song regardless.
; 
; The calculation time of 2 minutes means immediate relief from 
; fractal congestion.  A trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to view the completed image, will bring even more relief.
; 
; With a temperature of 66F 19C, Wednesday was just a bit too 
; chilly for comfort here at Fractal Central, but the light winds 
; and strong sun kept it from being uncomfortably cold.  The 
; fractal cats enjoyed the unbroken sun.
; 
; I enjoyed a day that was not too busy.  Tomorrow looks promising 
; also.  The next FOTD fractal will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and where will you be when the aliens arrive to 
; carry off all of us as slaves?
