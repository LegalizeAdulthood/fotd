; FOTD -- May 08, 2008 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I am often puzzled by dimensions.  What are they?  Are they 
; merely the number of mutually perpendicular lines that can be 
; erected through a single point in a given space?  Or are the 
; lines a mere indicator of dimension?  Where do dimensions come 
; from?  Why is our universe limited to three spatial dimensions 
; when a higher number would allow for far more varied phenomena?
; 
; Since stable planetary orbits are impossible in spaces of 
; dimensions greater than three, maybe intelligent life is 
; possible only in our familiar 3-D space.  But then why is it so 
; easy for computers to work with higher dimensions, and so easy 
; for humans to write about higher-dimensional phenomena, yet 
; impossible for humans to visualize the things they write about?
; 
; Before the 20th Century our universe was obviously three-
; dimensional.  All we had to do was look at it.  Then along came 
; relativity, which made the universe four-dimensional.  Next up 
; was Kaluza Klein theory, which required a five-dimensional 
; universe.  When string theory burst upon the scene, it needed 26 
; dimensions, which were somehow compressed into ten dimensions, 
; with six of them rolled up into infinitesimal hyper-loops.  The 
; last I heard, M-theory has upped this number to eleven 
; dimensions, with seven of them curled-up invisibly, and who 
; knows where we will go from here.
; 
; It is beginning to appear, at least to me, (not at all the 
; rational skeptic,) that the concept of dimensions is a human-
; invented mental construct, and what we know as visualized 
; dimensions are actually manifested levels of consciousness.  
; Humanity is at the three-dimensional level of consciousness.  
; Yes, I know this sounds mystical, but I am no apologist for the 
; hopelessly inadequate, common-sense Newtonian view of the 
; universe, which I now see as a sub-set of a far broader reality, 
; which is probably a sub-set of a still broader reality, and so 
; on to infinity.
; 
; But why worry about theoretical infinities when we have actual 
; infinities in the world of fractals.  Today's image came about 
; when I subtracted 1/2 part of Z^4 from one part of Z^3 and added 
; C to produce a parent fractal that resembles nothing as much as 
; an angel lying on its side with its head facing east and a 
; tongue of fire over its head.  (This Sunday is Pentecost.)
; 
; Today's image is located on the southern shore of this tongue of 
; fire, and indeed has eight tongues of fire circling the central 
; minibrot.  I named the finished work "Tongues of Fire" and rated 
; it at a 6-1/2.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/2 minutes is bordering on slowness, 
; but still brief enough to make running the included parameter 
; file almost a joy.  For those with over-qualified computers, the 
; finished image is posted for viewing on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Perfect spring weather prevailed all day Wednesday here at 
; Fractal Central.  The sky was clear, the wind was light, the 
; humidity was low and the temperature reached 81F 27C.  The 
; fractal cats were more concerned with the pigeons pecking for 
; scraps on the sidewalk.
; 
; My day was slow enough to leave time for both a fractal and a 
; philosophical discussion.  And better yet, it looks like 
; tomorrow will be the same.  Until next time, take care and you 
; can't get a universe from absolutely nothing, which means there 
; always was something rather than nothing.  (Don't ask why that 
; something has always been there.)
