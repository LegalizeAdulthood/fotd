; FOTD -- September 17, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I never took the existence of the evil one very seriously, that 
; is until behind me I heard FL exclaim, 'Oh my!', and saw the 
; dark one himself leering from the screen.  The scowling face is 
; more noticeable at some distance from the screen.  The prince of 
; darkness, complete with his army of imps, came into being when I 
; divided Z^2 by (Z^(-1.1)+0.5) or something like that, and set 
; the bailout radius to a stingy 3.
; 
; The resulting parent fractal is something I'm not going to try 
; to describe, though it contains a Mandelbrot set stretched in 
; the vertical direction, with two large semi-main buds attached 
; to the single period-2 main bud.  Today's scene, which is rota-
; ted 90 degrees, is located on the X-axis just west of the M-set.
; 
; I named the image "The Dark One Rises".  And the only place he 
; could be rising from is the fiery pit.  I rated the image at a 
; 7, not because I admire the evil one, but because the image is 
; a fractal, and a 7 is what I think such a fractal is worth.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/3 minutes is brief, but not too 
; brief for the duke of darkness to work his mischief.  But all 
; calculation may be avoided by going to the FOTD web site and 
; viewing the finished image there.  The web site may be accessed 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Tenacious clouds prevented the temperature of 68F 20C from being 
; perfect here at Fractal Central on Tuesday.  The fractal cats 
; were having a good day until Cassie caught wind of a stray cat 
; that had wandered onto the front porch.  When Nicholas saw her 
; bristled and growling in the window, he joined her, and together 
; they chased the intruder away.  I rewarded their bravery with an 
; extra treat of tuna.  They no longer get cheddar cheese, which 
; their doctor said is not too good for cats.
; 
; As for my day, it was close to average.  And tomorrow promises 
; to be the same.  Until next time, take care, and at least I did 
; not rate today's image at a 6.66.
