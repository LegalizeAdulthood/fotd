; FOTD -- September 18, 2008 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a complete reversal of yesterday's.  Though 
; today's image is a blow-up of a small part of the lower left 
; corner of yesterday's, it has none of the hellish malevolence.  
; Instead of the fiery devilish effect, we have a peaceful almost 
; heavenly effect, consisting almost entirely of various shades of 
; blue.  I can see no saints or angels in the scene, but who knows 
; what we might find if we were to dig deep enough.
; 
; Today's image is so different mostly because I evaporated the 
; scene by raising the bailout radius to 1000 and rendered the 
; resulting 'inside' stuff with the inside set to 'atan'.  The 
; result is an image that could almost have been taken through the 
; space telescope.  It is filled with stars and wispy fractal 
; nebulae, with a few spirals thrown in to remind us that this is 
; the virtual world of numbers, not the presumedly real world of 
; the outer universe.
; 
; I named the image "Beyond the Unknown".  After all, this rather 
; accurately describes most fractals.  The rating of an 8 may seem 
; liberal to some fractalists; to me it seems just about right.  
; The calculation time of 4-1/4 minutes actually grows longer if 
; any of the short-cut algorithms such as passes=g or passes=t are 
; used.  I guess the algorithms use too much time figuring what to 
; do next and too little time calculating.
; 
; But all these minor problems may be bypassed by viewing the 
; finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A foggy morning gave way to a sunny afternoon here at Fractal 
; Central on Wednesday.  The temperature of 75F 24C was just what 
; the fractal cats ordered.  In my department things were notably 
; un-notable.  Just to keep things un-notable, the next FOTD will 
; be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and walk with 
; N. Lightenment, whoever or whatever he is.
