; FOTD -- September 25, 2008 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Between reassuring FL that the end is not yet nigh, pondering 
; the fourth dimension, and finishing an unexpectedly large pile 
; of work, I had less time to devote to the FOTD on Wednesday than 
; I would have liked.
; 
; But all is not lost.  FL is reassured for at least a day that 
; the end is not yet here, and the work is behind me.  As for the 
; fourth dimension -- that continues to puzzle me.  Some things 
; supposedly possible in 4-D space are logically impossible.
; 
; I read recently in a book of four-dimensional geometry that when 
; a hypersphere is subject to double rotation and the two rota-
; tions are equal, then all points of the hypersphere except the 
; single point at the center move in a circle.  The puzzle is what 
; happens to the points at the centers of rotation of the circles. 
; Are these points moving in circles also?
; 
; The description of double rotation, says that they must be.  But 
; if they are, then the points circling them are being carried 
; along, and not moving in perfect circles at all.  As I said 
; above, it's logically impossible.  But one thing certain is that 
; the fourth dimension is fascinating.  It's too bad that, even 
; though my mind is capable of pondering 4-D, I'll never get to 
; see it -- at least not in this world.
; 
; I will get to see more fractals however.  In fact, today's image 
; is a grossly overblown sample of one.  I named it "A Flawed 
; Jewel" because I feel it has potential, but due to the lack of 
; time I was unable to bring out its full luster.  As it is, the 
; colors are far too gaudy, so much so that I dared not give the 
; image a rating.
; 
; Most of the gaudiness was achieved by rendering the scene with 
; the outside set to 'real' and the inside set to 'fmod' with a 
; proximity of 0.75.  A good part of the image consists of this 
; glorified inside stuff.
; 
; The little minibrot at the center suffers from an insufficient 
; maxiter, a flaw that is easily remedied at the cost of a little 
; slowdown by raising the maxiter to 3600.  With the maxiter at 
; 1800, the image calculates in 2-1/3 minutes.  A maxiter of 3600 
; adds about one minute.
; 
; All such problems may be eliminated however by surfing out to 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and enjoying the already-calculated GIF image posted there.
; 
; After the early morning fog cleared off, perfect early autumn 
; weather prevailed here at Fractal Central on Wednesday.  Total 
; sun and a temperature of 75F 19C can hardly be surpassed.  The 
; fractal cats' thrill came in the afternoon, when seven, yes 
; seven, half-grown cats appeared in the yard next door.  A half 
; hour later the seven cats were gone and the fractal cats had 
; settled to sleep.
; 
; As stated earlier, my day was quite busy.  Tomorrow will likely 
; be slower.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and though the country is a clown show, don't lose 
; the faith.
