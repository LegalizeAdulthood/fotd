; 
; FOTD -- September 11, 2008 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The complex logarithm is multi-valued.  To take advantage of 
; this, the MandelbrotBC (Branch-Cut) formulas are supposed to 
; make visible all the fractals that result from the infinity of 
; values that may be given to the 'k' part of the logarithm.  This 
; situation exists because the formula for the complex logarithm 
; is:
; 
;        (1/2)ln(x^2+y^2)+i(atan(y/x)+2kpi)
; 
; where the value of 'k' may be given any value from plus-to-minus 
; infinity.
; 
; I am not sure if any of the MandelbrotBC formulas calculate the 
; different values of 'k' correctly, or even if a correct way 
; actually exists.  In fact, I'm not even sure of where to look to 
; find a correct way.  The correct way, if one exists, would 
; probably fall in the field of 'complex variables' or something 
; like that, but information on 'complex variables' is not easy to 
; find.
; 
; One thing I am sure of however is that the MandelbrotBC 
; formulas, with the various functions applied, make some 
; incredible fractals, so who cares if the images are 
; mathematically correct.
; 
; Today's image lies in the Z^(1-2/3)+C Mandeloid as it appears 83 
; levels up the logarithmic ladder, with the 'floor' function in 
; effect.  At this level, the Mandeloid somewhat resembles a 
; distorted Mandelbrot set standing on its nose.  The scene is 
; located deep in the chaos on the western shoreline of the large 
; period-2 bud, which is actually shaped rather like a nose.
; 
; The minibrot at the center of today's image suffers from an 
; insufficient maxiter, but its surrounding pattern is unusually 
; well-defined for a minibrot in this range.
; 
; All things considered, I rated the image at a 6-1/2, not quite 
; as high as I would have liked, but high enough to make the 
; calculation worth the 4-1/2 minutes required.
; 
; The name "Age of Iteration" has no significant meaning.  
; I simply pulled it out of the air.
; 
; Finally, if all else fails, the completed GIF image is available 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; In comparison to Tuesday, Wednesday's weather began peacefully 
; here at Fractal Central, with singing birds and wisps of fog 
; hanging over the river.  When the fog cleared away, we were left 
; with a day of mostly clear skies and a temperature of 72F 22C.  
; The fractal cats purred approval, then meowed for breakfast.
; 
; After such a hectic week, Wednesday, which actually was about 
; average, seemed unusually slow.  But psychological time ignored, 
; the next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and when it comes, recognize it for what it is.
