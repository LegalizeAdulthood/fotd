; FOTD -- September 23, 2008 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The fourth dimension is all around us, but because we look in 
; the wrong direction, we can't see it.  Then we protest that 
; there are no more directions out there for us to look in.  And 
; this explains the difficulty.  Instead of looking out there, we 
; must look within, into our minds, which is where the fourth 
; dimension, whatever it is, intersects our three-dimensional 
; space.
; 
; After years of looking within, I have created a mental four-
; dimensional hyper-planet, which I sometimes explore when sleep 
; eludes me.  Exploring this planet one 3-D section at a time is a 
; far more efficient way of falling asleep than counting sheep.
; 
; Sometimes, while traveling around the equator of my hyperplanet, 
; I can almost form an image of the whole hypersphere.  As I 
; progress westward, I can see the polar great circle, which is 
; the axis of rotation, appearing to turn on itself, all points of 
; it always 90 degrees from wherever I may wander on the equator.
; 
; At the same time, the equator can be the axis of rotation of the 
; polar circle, resulting in the strange motion known as double 
; rotation, a motion that can exist only in spaces of four or more 
; dimensions.  I am not sure what would be the apparent motion of 
; the heavenly bodies as seen from the surface of a 4-D planet in 
; a state of double rotation, but I suspect it might resemble a 
; 3-D helix.
; 
; One thing totally certain is that today's image has a minibrot 
; at the center, and lies in the fractal that results when the 
; formula Z^(1.9)+C. is iterated 8.7 turns up the logarithmic 
; ladder with no function applied.
; 
; When I named the image "Safe at Home", I might have been 
; thinking of the Orioles baseball team, which I still listen to 
; on the radio.  I was definitely thinking of the coloring when 
; I rated the otherwise humdrum image at a 7.5.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-2/3 minutes will give the eager 
; fractalist little time to think of anything else.  And as 
; always, the finished image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Persistent clouds blocked the sun here at Fractal Central on 
; Monday, but the temperature of 70F 21C was near ideal.  The 
; fractal cats must have agreed, for they spent an unusually long 
; time on their shelf in the side window, watching for any stray 
; cats that might wander by.
; 
; My day was rather good.  The work was out of the way just after 
; lunch, and the fractal is at least adequate.  The next FOTD will 
; be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and live life in 
; the hyper-reality of 4-D.
