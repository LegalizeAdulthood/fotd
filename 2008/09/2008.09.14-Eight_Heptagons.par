; FOTD -- September 14, 15, 2005 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; NEW FORMULA ALERT!  The DivideBrot5a formula is a new one.
; 
; And today's FOTD is good for two days.
; 
; It's hard to be a fractal visionary when you're looking at the 
; stuff someone else threw out, or a lot of wannabe-country stuff 
; such as feel-good slogans, teddy bears and scented candles.  (I 
; think they call this stuff 'primitives'.)  Maybe I'm insensi-
; tive, but to keep FL happy on Saturday, we went down to an old 
; factory in Duncanon, where they once made Lightning Guider 
; sleds, to look at the stuff there.  (I'm ashamed to admit that 
; some of the stuff actually brought back pleasant old memories.)
; 
; But regardless of how I felt about the expedition, when we got 
; back to FC, it was after dark, and I had no time to do the FOTD 
; for Sep 14.  All is not lost however.  The FOTD for September 14 
; is combined with the FOTD for the 15th, and is here now in its 
; full glory.  (No claims are made as to the amount of glory.)  
; It's a scene in the fractal that results when Z^2 is divided by 
; something like (Z^(-0.75)+1) with the bailout radius set to a 
; chokingly small value of 2.
; 
; Look at it and like it, or look and laugh, the image is very 
; fast, calculating in 49 seconds.  I named it "Eight Heptagons" 
; for obvious reasons.  I gave it no rating however, but if I had 
; rated it, I would probably have given it a 5.
; 
; The easiest way to see the image is to give Paul a chance to 
; post it, and then to view it on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Saturday here at Fractal Central was a partly cloudy and plea-
; sant day with light rain in the evening.  Sunday was unusually 
; warm, with a temperature of 88F 31C, which would have been warm 
; even in July.  The fractal cats slept through most of the in-
; action.  Once I survived the antiquing expedition, (It really 
; was not as tortuous as I put on.), the rest of the week-end was 
; easy.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours, and it just 
; might be pretty good.
; 
; Until next time, take care, and reality is all around you.
