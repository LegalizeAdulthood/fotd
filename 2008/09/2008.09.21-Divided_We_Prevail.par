; FOTD -- September 21, 2008 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I somehow got involved in another 'antiquing' expedition on 
; Saturday, this one to a tiny town named Richfield.  And I must 
; reluctantly admit that I am actually starting to enjoy these 
; weekly trips to examine the stuff someone else no longer wanted. 
; We got back to FC by 5pm, which left barely enough time to do 
; the FOTD.  As for that FOTD, it turned out surprisingly good.
; 
; The parent fractal is the Mandeloid that appears when the 
; formula Z^(1.9)+C is iterated 22 levels up the logarithmic 
; ladder when no function is applied.
; 
; Today's scene is located in a wedge-like valley leading to a 
; large bud, where the fractal is divided to an unusual degree.  
; Due to the fortuitous coloring, the image is one of the better 
; ones I have yet found in the exponent range between 1 and 2.
; 
; The rating of 8.5 includes the 1/2 point for my coloring effort. 
; The name "Divided We Prevail" hints at the discontinuities that 
; fill the frame and actually create the patterns.
; 
; The calculation time of 2-1/2 minutes is about what would be 
; expected for such an image.  This is about the same time that is 
; required to surf over to the FOTD web site and view the finished 
; image there.  The web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Thick cirrus clouds occasionally dimmed the sun here at Fractal 
; Central on Saturday, but the temperature of 73F 23C was as 
; perfect as could be hoped for.  The fractal cats must have 
; agreed, for while we were out, they spent the afternoon in the 
; window, wishing they could go out with us.
; 
; My day was spent doing my duty, which isn't all that bad.  The 
; next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours or so.  Until then, take 
; care, and don't let the fourth dimension abstractions leave you 
; all abstracted.
