; 
; FOTD -- August 14, 2008 (Rating Unbounded)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Since space is unbounded though not necessarily infinite, and 
; today's image reminds me of a globular cluster in space, I 
; decided to give today's image an unbounded rating.  Regardless 
; of what this means when applied to a fractal rating, today's 
; image is different enough to be well worth a look.
; 
; I named the image "Cosmic Un-Conquest" in sympathy with mankind, 
; who, because he must carry a clumsy physical body with him 
; wherever he goes, will never conquer even the solar system, much 
; less the infinite multiverse.  A temporary mind of limitless 
; fancy trapped in a body of wet kleenex can do little more than 
; sit here on earth, look up at the night sky and wish it were 
; otherwise.
; 
; But such is not the case with fractals, where we can venture 
; wherever our computers and fanciful minds can take us.  In 
; today's case we journey to the land of Z^2/(Z^(-2)+11)+C, which 
; at first appears to be a blank screen consisting totally of 
; inside stuff.  But, as the 'bof61' fill reveals, this inside 
; stuff is active.
; 
; Today's image is unusual in that it is dependent on both the 
; screen resolution and the choice of passes.  Whenever one of 
; these is changed, a different image will result, since different 
; dots will be chosen or passed over.
; 
; Perhaps the biggest drawback in the image is its rather slow 
; calculation time of 10 minutes.  But this drawback may be turned 
; into an advantage by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image is posted for effortless viewing.
; 
; Fine midsummer weather prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Wednesday, with a cat-pleasing temperature of 82F 28C and sunny 
; skies.  In my department things went pretty well also.  As for 
; the next FOTD, it will be posted in 24 hours, perhaps not as 
; cosmic as today's but interesting nevertheless.  Until then, let 
; your mind soar where your body cannot.
