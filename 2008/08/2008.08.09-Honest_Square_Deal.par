; FOTD -- August 09, 2008 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yesterday's image is a Julia set that closely resembles the one 
; in which the curious rectangle is found.  In today's image I 
; searched the place where the rectangle is found in the other 
; Julia set.  I found no open rectangle, though I did find an 
; interesting rectangular shaped area quite deep at the same place 
; in today's parent Julia set.
; 
; OK, I admit I got out the evolver and fudged the real(p3) 
; parameter a bit, and I also made a few tweaks to yesterday's 
; color palette, but it's all in the name of good art.
; 
; Even though the main feature of the image is a rectangle, I 
; named it "Honest Square Deal".  I gave it this name because no 
; one ever heard of a rectangular deal.  When the time came to 
; assign the rating, I thought briefly and absent-mindedly before 
; rating the image at a 7.  A rating of a 7 is like the word 
; 'nice'.  It sounds pleasant but means nothing.
; 
; The one place where the image really does excel is in its calcu-
; lation time, which at just over one minute will make the job of 
; running the included parameter file as pleasant as a day at 
; one's favorite get-away spot.
; 
; Those whose over-qualified computers have an incurable case of 
; fractintphobia may see the finished image on the FOTD web site 
; at:

; 
; Friday was pleasant enough here at Fractal Central.  There was 
; lots of sunshine and a temperature of 75F 24C, and if the sudden 
; but brief midday thunder-shower was ignored, the day was ideal 
; for any outdoor activity.  The fractal cats had a rough day 
; however.  This morning FL took Cassie to the doctor for a shot, 
; and when Nicholas, the macho one who fears only the doctor, saw 
; the carrying box come out, he dashed under the bed, where he hid 
; for several hours.  All went well with Cassie, who normally is 
; the timid one, but faced the doctor heroically.
; 
; My day was moderately busy, as I got the work out of the way in 
; preparation for a planned day out on Saturday.  If the FOTD for 
; August 10 is late, it will indicate that the day out was a 
; success.  Until next time, take care, and a fractal a day will 
; keep the doctor away, at least until you run out of fractals.
