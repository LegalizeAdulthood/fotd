; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- August 29, 2008 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Everyone is for the underdog, even though the underdog rarely 
; wins.  In today's image however, the underdog actually wins.  It 
; wins by default more or less.  Due to an unexpected rush job, I 
; had no time to explore for a new fractal, so I grabbed an old 
; image that has been lying in the 'maybe' file for months.
; 
; It is obvious why this image never made it beyond the 'possible 
; FOTD' stage.  It has little to show.  This is the kind of scene 
; I usually immediately pass over on the way to the final FOTD, 
; but with today's lack of time, it is where I stopped.
; 
; I'm not going to deceive myself into thinking the image is worth 
; more than a 4.  In fact, even the rating of a 4 might be a bit 
; generous.  The only thing of note in the image is a minibrot in 
; the upper left corner shaped rather like a peanut.  The rest of 
; the scene is a mish-mash of broken-up fractal stuff, some of it 
; arranged into curious patterns, but ultimately dis-satisfying.
; 
; The parent fractal looks much like the minibrot in today's 
; image; the scene is found in the east branch of a valley leading 
; to the northern period-2 bud.
; 
; I named the image "The Underdog Wins".  In a way, due to the 
; rush, this underdog image actually did win its way into FOTD 
; immortality.
; 
; The calculation time of 5 minutes is longer than I would have 
; preferred for an image such as today's, but relief is at hand on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the already-calculated image is posted for immediate 
; satisfaction.
; 
; The weather was far from perfect here at Fractal Central on 
; Thursday, as the remains of the dissipated tropical storm Fay 
; arrived.  Heavy clouds prevailed all day but only a few light 
; sprinkles fell from them, while the temperature hovered around 
; 70C 21C.  The fractal cats spent a good part of the day watching 
; for the manx tomcat who is trying to establish his territory in 
; the small field beyond the back yard.  The intruder cat never 
; appeared and the fractal duo eventually grew bored watching the 
; rain.
; 
; My day was unexpectedly busy, which explains the 'filler' 
; fractal.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and don't mix the concrete with the abstract.  It can 
; lead only to confusion.
