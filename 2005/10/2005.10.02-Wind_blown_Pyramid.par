; FOTD -- October 02, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; One plus one equals two.  That simple fact is true, at least in 
; our universe.  Russell proved it in his masterwork almost a 
; century ago while trying to demonstrate that math is completely 
; self-consistent.  (Godel soon proved him wrong.)  But would one 
; plus one equal two in every possible universe?  Who knows?  And 
; I'm not so sure it's true everywhere in even our own universe.  
; After all, according to relativity, the velocity of light added 
; to the velocity of light equals the velocity of light. If the 
; velocity of light equals X, then X+X=X, (or one plus one equals 
; one).  I guess it's all relative to how one and one are added 
; together.
; 
; The rating of today's image is also relative.  I created it with 
; a formula I wrote around 8 years ago and named TowerExp02.  But 
; I soon put the formula into cold storage.  Yesterday, when I 
; opened it for the first time since then, I found why I had put 
; it away.
; 
; Today's image consists almost entirely of inside material made 
; visible by the bof61 inside fill.  Relatively speaking, the 
; image is average, and therefore rates a 5.  The name "Wind-blown 
; Pyramid" came about when I imagined one of the Egyptian pyramids 
; in a sandstorm.  Of course, pyramids made of solid stone do not 
; bend in the wind like today's fractal pyramid is doing, but 
; neither do fractals obey the laws of the physical world.
; 
; The included parameter file renders in 3-3/4 minutes on my worn-
; out 9-1/2 year old machine with the exhaust fan that must be 
; kick started by hand.  On the newer XP units, it it runs at all, 
; it will finish in a minute or so.
; 
; But all rendering problems may be bypassed by downloading the 
; pre-rendered image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The absolutely perfect weather on Saturday here at Fractal 
; Central was mirrored in the absolutely perfect behavior of the 
; fractal cats.  They are behaving absolutely perfectly so often 
; lately that I am beginning to wonder what has happened to the 
; Thomas and Tippy I knew for almost 15 years, the cat duo who 
; once frantically chased each other all around the house and 
; yard.  I rather miss the thunder of cat feet dashing up and down 
; the stairs, and the thrashing of the bushes as they dash about 
; after each other.  Oh well, the weather can't remain perfect 
; forever, and cats can't be good forever.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours give or take a few.  Until 
; that wondrous moment of enlightenment arrives, take care, and 
; seeking truth is one thing, recognizing it when one finds it is 
; quite another.
