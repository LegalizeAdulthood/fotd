; FOTD -- October 18, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; What can be said about a fractal that takes less than one second 
; to finish?  Not much I fear.  But today's soft, wavy image does 
; just this.  It renders in an impossible 7/8 of one second on my 
; tired old machine.  I doubt that it could render faster, even on 
; the newest units, since it will take them about one second to 
; shift into the chosen vesa video mode.
; 
; Today's resurrected old formula, named Test-01, is something I 
; wrote back in 1996.  Having not seen it for nine years, I have 
; no idea of what I was trying to accomplish when I wrote it.  
; Possibly, I was investigating the four odd planes of the Juli-
; brot.  After all, the small open area at the center of today's 
; image does rather resemble the Elliptic slice of the Julibrot.  
; But whatever its original purpose was, I soon laid the formula 
; aside and forgot it -- until yesterday, that is.
; 
; With its two changeable functions, the formula actually draws 
; some quite interesting fractals.  Today's image, which somewhat 
; resembles a reflection in a puddle of water, is a sample of what 
; it does.  In keeping with the trend of recent days, I named the 
; image "Mandel Variation-7"
; 
; The rating of a 7 is largely due to the extra effort I put into 
; the coloring, which, at least on my monitor, is almost but not 
; quite perfectly smooth.  
; 
; There is little more to be said about the image, which speaks 
; for itself, using light waves instead of sound waves of course.  
; As I said earlier, the image is faster than light, but those 
; without the 7/8 of one second to spare can visit the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download the finished product from there.
; 
; A temperature that was slightly too chilly and a wind that was 
; a little too brisk kept the fractal cats from being perfectly 
; happy on Monday.  But they still managed over an hour in the 
; holly patch, checking the holly berries, which are just starting 
; to turn red.  Once I finished the day's work, my day was equally 
; satisfactory.  Today is starting a bit milder, and with no wind. 
; It looks like a better day coming for the cats.  The next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and then have a 
; bit of fun.
