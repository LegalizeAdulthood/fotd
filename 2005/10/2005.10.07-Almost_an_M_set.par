; FOTD -- October 07, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's resurrected formula was never quite as dead as some of 
; the other formulas in the jim.frm file, which is where I store 
; the formulas that I have almost but not quite forgotten.  I have 
; already used it a number of times to create FOTD images.  But 
; like most of the other half-forgotten formulas, I have no idea 
; what I was trying to accomplish when I wrote it.
; 
; Actually, this particular formula holds quite a bit of 
; potential.  It could be the most under-appreciated in my vast 
; collection of near-forgettable efforts, and certainly deserves a 
; place in my active allinone.frm file.
; 
; With the inside set to number zero, the formula draws nothing 
; but empty circles, regardless of how the parameters and function 
; are tweaked.  But when the inside is set to an active fill, such 
; as the 'bof61' of today's image, the empty circles are filled 
; with strange and often totally unpredictable fractal patterns 
; unlike anything seen in normal inside-outside images.  The bof61 
; fill colors the pixels according to the number of the iteration 
; that takes that point closest to the origin.
; 
; Today's image, which consists entirely of 'inside' material, is 
; named "Almost an M-set".  While studying it, I noticed a shape 
; in the center that looks like it is trying to be a midget Mandel-
; brot set, but is not quite making it.  It comes close enough 
; however to be the source of the name for the entire image.
; 
; Trying to rate the image proved more difficult than expected.  
; When I first saw it, I thought, wow this is great -- it rates an 
; 8!  Then I looked again and thought, now what's so unusual about 
; it -- it's just another fractal like I've seen hundreds of times 
; before, and it rates only a 3.  I finally decided on a rating of 
; an average 5.  That way I could not be too far off.
; 
; The render time of 4 minutes is acceptably fast for an average 
; image.  Simply copy this letter into your Fractint directory 
; (folder) with a .par extension, and run it as you would any 
; other parameter file.  If something goes wrong, do not panic.  
; Simply go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download the completed image from there.
; 
; The clouds hung heavy all day Thursday here at Fractal Central, 
; with short light showers at frequent intervals and a high 
; temperature of 77F 25C.  Though only 0.04 inch (1mm) of rain 
; fell all day, the grass stayed wet, making it just another rainy 
; day from the cats point of view.  They passed the day on their 
; shelf by the window, wishing it were a better day.  Today is 
; starting with flood warnings in effect.  This does not bode well 
; for the cat duo.  For me things look quite average.  The next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and where 
; was today's fractal hiding when the (theoretical) big bang 
; happened?
