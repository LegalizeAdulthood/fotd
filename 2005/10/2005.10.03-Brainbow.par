; FOTD -- October 03, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's FOTD we break out another long ago and far away 
; formula, this one with the rather uninspiring name, TestZero.  
; As is the case with most of these old formulas, I have forgotten 
; what I was trying to accomplish when I wrote it.  But in many 
; cases there is no loss, for there never was a goal in mind.
; 
; The iterated expression, z=z*c^fn1(z), is simple enough, and the 
; fractals it creates are mostly unimpressive, but once in a 
; while, with the aid of an intelligent human, a notable image 
; appears.  Today's image, which shows the entire fractal rotated 
; -90 degrees, is one of those rare cases.
; 
; The image consists of a blue rainbow arching over a cold land-
; scape on an alien planet somewhere on the other side of the 
; galaxy.  I named it "Brainbow" in recognition of the part a 
; human played in its creation.  It is different enough to earn a 
; non-inflated rating of 7.
; 
; The render time of the included parameter file is 7-1/2 minutes 
; on my cranky old machine.  This time will be cut to a minute or 
; two on the newest units that can actually run the file.  In any 
; case, the finished GIF image may be downloaded from the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With total sun and a high temperature of 79F 26C, the Sunday 
; weather was totally perfect here at Fractal Central, keeping the 
; cats perfect also.  My day was uneventful.  Today is starting as 
; near perfect as a day could be, leading me to expect another 
; perfect day in all respects.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours, but take note -- absolute fractal perfection is unlikely. 
; Until then, take care, and don't get over-iterated.
