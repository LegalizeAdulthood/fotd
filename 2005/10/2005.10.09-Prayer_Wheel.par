; FOTD -- October 09, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In the middle ages the politically powerful Catholic Church sold 
; indulgences.  By purchasing an indulgence with earthly money, 
; bereaved relatives could buy their loved one's way out of purga-
; tory and end the soul's suffering.  This required the ridiculous 
; assumption that God's favor could be bought with money, but from 
; what I read, the indulgence business, along with obligatory 
; contributions, under penalty of hell-fire, kept the churches and 
; monasteries going rather well.
; 
; Other religions have similar short cuts to spiritual success.  
; Buddhists had prayer wheels, which worked much like the Catholic 
; indulgences once did.  Instead of spending hours saying the 
; proper prayers, a devout Buddhist needed only to spin the right 
; prayer wheel, and the prayer recorded on that wheel would be 
; sent to the creative higher power, which in this case is not 
; considered a supreme superman-like being.  For some strange 
; reason, today's image reminds me of a Buddhist prayer wheel.
; 
; The formula that did the deed is named 'Mytest09'.  It appears 
; to have been written around the same time I wrote yesterday's 
; 'Mytest07' formula, and like that formula, the purpose of 
; today's formula, if any, is a mystery.  But mysterious or not, 
; today's formula, with its two changeable functions, creates a 
; large variety of fractals.
; 
; The one active function I used in today's image is called 
; 'cosxx'.  (The 'ident' function acts as no function.)  Don't 
; try looking up cosxx in a math book because it will not be 
; there.  The function is actually a mistake that was made in an 
; early version of Fractint and was kept in the program because 
; it creates some interesting fractals.
; 
; Today's image was rendered with the outside set to 'tdis', 
; though there is very little to distinguish this rendering from 
; the outside=iter version.
; 
; The rating of a 6 seems appropriate for today's effort.  And the 
; render time of only 9+ seconds can hardly be beat.  It will take 
; several times as long to go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download the completed image from there.  But for those with 
; Fractint deprived computers, this might be the only way to view 
; the scene.
; 
; The rain fell heavily all day Saturday here at Fractal Central, 
; adding up to something over 7-1/2 inches, 190mm, and creating 
; much local flooding, including the Fractal Central basement, 
; which boasts a brand-new puddle of water.  I guess we can blame 
; it on the farmers, who for several months have been praying so 
; hard for rain.  Now that their crops are lost, God has finally 
; sent the rain.  In fact, He has sent so much rain that in addi-
; tion to losing their crops, some farmers have lost their homes 
; as well.  I guess you just can't win when bargaining with a god 
; who, as the nuns told me in school, works in mysterious ways.
; 
; The fractal cats have far more important things than God to 
; concern themselves with.  Their yard looks like a frog pond, 
; and it will be several days before it dries out enough to be 
; stepped on by sensitive cat paws.  They are not about ready to 
; start praying, but their mood is as dismal as a swamp, and they 
; are demanding all the extra tuna I can give them.  Tuna can do 
; only so much for disgruntled cats however, and better weather 
; will be needed before they are once again themselves.
; 
; Unfortunately, better weather does not seem to be near.  Today 
; is starting very cloudy with showers forecast, and in addition 
; it is much cooler.  It looks like a bum day coming up for the 
; duo.  For me it looks like another average day.  The next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and get your 
; vectors straight.
