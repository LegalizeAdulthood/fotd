; FOTD -- October 12, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's resurrected formula is named MytestAH.  It is a very 
; simple formula which combines positive and negative exponents of 
; the same absolute value before adding C.  Z is initialized at 1 
; because this is the critical point of functions of this type.
; 
; The formula draws some very twisted Mandeloids, especially when 
; complex or imaginary exponents are used.  I think I used this 
; formula to create interesting midgets before I developed the 
; MandelbrotMix4 formula.
; 
; In today's image the exponent has been set to 1.0001, a value 
; which is surprisingly close to unity, yet still creates a 
; fractal.  I have not checked to see how much closer to unity the 
; exponent value could be set before the fractal nature vanishes.
; 
; I named today's image "Purple at Midnight".  The name is based 
; entirely on the deep purple color palette.  And yes, a simple 
; "Purple Midnight" would have been a more poetic name, but I 
; wanted to be different.  Actually, even the midnight effect is 
; questionable, and could be missed entirely when viewed on overly 
; bright monitors.
; 
; The rating of a 5 seems about right for the image.  The same 
; effect is easily achievable with the M-Mix4 formula, and I have 
; already posted several FOTD images that looked much the same as 
; today's.
; 
; Though today's formula does little that is really new, the old 
; formula I have chosen for tomorrow's FOTD is one of the most 
; surprising of all time.  Be sure not to miss it.
; 
; Today's image is quite a bit on the slow side, rendering as it 
; does in 1 hour and 14 minutes.  But relief is always nearby on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the finished image has been or soon will be posted, ready 
; for viewing.
; 
; Heavy clouds, wet ground, occasional showers and a temperature 
; of 63F 17C kept the fractal cats confined to the house all day 
; Tuesday here at Fractal Central.  But due to their excessive 
; sleepiness, their complaints were at a minimum.  Today is start-
; ing cloudy again.  The ground is still very wet, so I doubt that 
; things will be any better.
; 
; I plan on a relaxing day.  Unfortunately, my plans do not always 
; work out.  One thing near certain however is the appearance of 
; the next FOTD in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and know that 
; we have our being in a great fractal.
