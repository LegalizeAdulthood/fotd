; FOTD -- October 10, 2005 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's old formula turned up in an old file dated December 
; 1998.  As is usually the case with these old formulas, I have no 
; idea what I was trying to accomplish when I wrote it.  Most 
; likely, I was simply doing random things to see what would 
; happen.
; 
; The formula combines Z^n and (-Z)^n, a combination that has no 
; effect when 'n' is an integer, but does strange things when 'n' 
; has a fractional value, such as the 1.05 of today's image.
; 
; I named the image "Fractal Bits" when I noticed the bits and 
; pieces that fill the frame.  There is a definite 2-way symmetry 
; in the scene, but I doubt that a midget of order 1.05 lies at 
; the center of symmetry.  The feeling is more one of an endless 
; spiral.
; 
; The rating of a 4 indicates that I do not think too much of the 
; image, which has no real center of attention.  An endless string 
; of images like this are probably why the formula was discarded.
; 
; The render time of under 4 minutes is mercifully short.  But the 
; time it will take to go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download the finished image from there is even shorter.
; 
; Heavy clouds, sopping wet ground and chilly temperatures erased 
; all thoughts of an enjoyable day in the yard from the minds of 
; the fractal cats on Sunday.  Yes, cats do have minds.  They have 
; minds that work better than the minds of some of my customers.  
; The cats satisfied themselves as best as possible with the tuna 
; treat.  Several of my customers are never satisfied with what I 
; give them.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy, chilly and drizzly -- a rather unplea-
; sant combination.  But at least it's a minor holiday and there 
; is not too much to be done.  The next FOTD will appear as it 
; almost always does in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and just 
; think about it.
