; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The topic of politics just will not go away.  While paying the 
; phone bill yesterday, fractal lady wondered aloud whether she 
; should check the box that would add a dollar to the bill to be 
; used to help teach the children to read.  I reminded her that 
; three months ago when we paid the taxes, about one-thousand 
; dollars of the total went to support the city schools that are 
; supposed to teach children to read, and if one-thousand dollars 
; from every tax-payer were not enough to eliminate illiteracy, I 
; doubted that one more dollar from us would help.  I guess this 
; proves I'm a non-caring right-wing extremist.  Oh well, on to 
; the fractals.  At least fractals are non-political.
; 
; I enjoy doing variations of the Mandelbrot set, and today's old 
; retired formula, which for some reason I named "MytestAG", does 
; a very interesting and unexpected variation.  When I wrote the 
; formula I must have been thinking of the fact that an imaginary 
; number multiplied by an imaginary number gives a real number, so 
; in the formula I raised Z to an imaginary power, then raised the 
; result to a second imaginary power to see what kind of real-
; number fractals would result.
; 
; Since 2 raised to the power of 1 equals 2, it is not surprising 
; that the Mandelbrot set appears in today's image.  What is sur-
; prising is all the extra decorative stuff that has mysteriously 
; appeared in the M-set.  Our old friend has become a Christmas-
; tree set, decorated with infinite arcs and rings.  Its basic 
; shape is still there but all the fine details have been oblitera-
; ted by the spurious stuff that has appeared.  Even more surpris-
; ing is the fact that these arcs and circles continue unchanged 
; as deep as one decides to search.  Of course, in the world of 
; fractals, nothing should be considered truly surprising.
; 
; The iterated line in today's formula is z=(z^a)^(-b)+c.  When I 
; saw this, I wondered why I wrote -b instead of b.  After all, I 
; could get the same result by writing the even simpler expression 
; z=(z^a)^(b)+c, and entering -1 instead of 1 as the value of b.  
; Before writing today's parameter file, I made this slight change 
; to the formula, fully expecting no change in the image.  But the 
; image did change.  It was a small change but a change indeed.  
; This leads me to suspect that much if not all of today's image 
; is an artifact of math imprecision.  Switching the changeable 
; parameters also makes a change in the image, which would also 
; seem to indicate that the image is an artifact.  But artifact or 
; not, it is a worthy image that rates a 7.
; 
; I named the image "Mandel Variation-1".  The extra 1 was added 
; to the name just in case I decide to investigate other varia-
; tions, which at the present time I do not expect to do.
; 
; The render time of 12 seconds is about as fast as a fractal can 
; be.  On the most advanced 'state-of-the-art' units, the image, 
; if it runs at all, will likely be completed before the video 
; switches to the chosen mode.  Those with handicapped units that 
; choke when the word 'Fractint' is mentioned may see the festive 
; Mandelbrot set by downloading the finished image from the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The cloudy, coolish and wet conditions prevailed all day Monday 
; here at the center of the fractal world.  The cats dwelling at 
; the center were notably unhappy.  Tippy was so unhappy that he 
; leaped into the refrigerator when I opened the door for an after-
; noon snack, and almost got himself shut in.  Thomas slept on the 
; window shelf most all day.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy with light rain about.  The rain is due 
; to continue, so the cats' bad mood will likely continue also.  
; For me it looks like a rather busy day in store.  The next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and regardless 
; of where one travels, he always finds himself at the apparent 
; center of the universe.
