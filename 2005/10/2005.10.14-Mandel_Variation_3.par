; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's old long-unused formula is named "Test0622".  It is so 
; simple that it barely deserves being called a formula.  It draws 
; only the Mandelbrot set with a changeable parameter and function 
; added to initial C.  But as today's image shows, in the world of 
; fractals, little initial changes can produce great final results.
; 
; Despite its unlikely appearance, the segmented worm-like shape 
; filling today's cropped image is the Mandelbrot set.  The shape 
; and proportions have been changed, but topologically the set is 
; unchanged.  Nothing has been added or taken away.
; 
; It is the exponential function and parameter which have been 
; applied to C that are responsible for the craziness.  I'm not 
; certain how, but when this function is applied to C, the effect 
; is to enlarge the designated point to infinity, resulting in an 
; image something like what one might see if he were actually in 
; the world of the Mandelbrot set, standing at the point and 
; looking at the scenery surrounding him.
; 
; In today's image the point is in a remote valley on the northern 
; shoreline of the main bay of the M-set.  The main bay itself is 
; the open area farthest to the right, where East Valley and the 
; main negative stem are vaguely visible.
; 
; The wide-screen effect does not mean something is wrong with 
; your monitor.  I have changed the proportions of the image to 
; avoid repeating parts of the distorted M-set.  A single outzoom 
; will reveal that today's image is part of an infinite repeating 
; series of identical images.
; 
; In order for the image to render properly in the vicinity of the 
; central point itself, the periodicity must be turned off.  I 
; have done this in the parameter file.
; 
; The maxiter of 45000 would seem to be far beyond what is 
; necessary for an image of the entire Mandelbrot set, but 
; carefully check the left edge of the image.  The maxiter there 
; is barely adequate.
; 
; Though most of the value of today's image is mathematical, it 
; has enough artistic worth to rate a 6.  The name "Mandel 
; Variation-3" is a simple description.  The render time of 9 
; minutes is reasonably fast, but the image may be seen much 
; faster by downloading it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A most unpleasant chilly drizzly day here at Fractal Central on 
; Thursday made the Fractal Central cats most unhappy.  Extra tuna 
; in the evening made them less unhappy.  Today is starting the 
; same as yesterday, but without the drizzle.  I expect little 
; happiness to come the cats' way.  My work is reasonably caught 
; up, so I am neutral.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and look for the fractal lining.
