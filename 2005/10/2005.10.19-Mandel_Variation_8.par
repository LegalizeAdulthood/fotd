; FOTD -- October 19, 2005 (Rating NA)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a variation of yesterday's image.  It was 
; created by the same formula, and the only change is in the real 
; p1 parameter, which has been raised from 1 to 10.  I did not 
; rate the image, since it is a virtual repeat of yesterday's.  
; The name indicates that the image is the eighth in the series of 
; Mandelbrot variations.  The render time of today's image is 
; slightly longer than yesterday's, though I doubt that anyone 
; will complain about an additional 1/10 of a second.  The 
; finished image is available for viewing on the FOTD web site at:

; 
; In yesterday's mail I received the November issue of 'Scientific 
; American' magazine.  When I opened it I found several interest-
; ing articles.  The first article says that a deadly 'bird flu' 
; epidemic is possible.  I'll have to raise 'bird flu' higher on 
; my list of other media-induced things to worry about.  In the 
; meantime, to take my mind off the ever-increasing list of things 
; to worry about, I'll rush out and buy the sponsor's products.
; 
; Another article in the magazine speculates that the force of 
; gravity might be a kind of illusion arising from interactions in 
; a lower-dimensional realm.  (I thought there were supposed to be 
; 10 or 11 dimensions in the world of supermembranes.)
; 
; The last article tackles the question of how the very material 
; brain generates the sense of the very immaterial 'self'.  (Hope-
; fully it goes beyond merely measuring brain activity.)
; 
; I have not yet found time to thoroughly read any of these 
; articles, but I am already intrigued by the fact that in the 
; same publication there is an article about physics, implying 
; that the search for answers must extend beyond the intuitive 
; range of our senses, and another article about neurobiology, 
; implying that we need not search beyond the range of our senses 
; for the answers.  Come on guys, these are big mysteries.  Let's 
; have a bit of philosophical agreement here.
; 
; Perhaps I don't even need to read the articles.  The first 
; article probably is another remotely possible idea that most 
; likely will go the way of the luminiferous ether.  The second is 
; probably a study of what happens in the brain when a person is 
; conscious.  It almost certainly will not bridge the gap between 
; interacting neurons and our inner sense of 'self' in a comprehen-
; sible manner.
; 
; Turning to my own field, graphic design, a very large job has 
; come in, which will leave me little time to ponder other things 
; for the rest of the week.  Due to the rush, the next FOTD will 
; be delayed for several days.
; 
; An unexpectedly pleasant sunny 77F 25C day on Tuesday made the 
; fractal cats very happy.  And even better, today promises to be 
; equally as pleasant.  For me the work has once again piled up 
; and it will take several days to clear things away.  The next 
; FOTD will appear by next Monday or Tuesday.  Until then I will 
; be very busy but not too busy to keep up with the fractal lists. 
; Take care, and if gravity, which seems very real, is only an 
; illusion, how much more that appears real is only an illusion?
