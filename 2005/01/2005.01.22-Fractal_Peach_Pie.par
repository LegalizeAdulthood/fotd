; FOTD -- January 22, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The JimsCompMand formula, which was used to draw today's image, 
; is a new addition to my 'allinone' formula file, the file that 
; holds all the formulas I use most often.  The formula itself is 
; nearly 10 years old, though during most of that time it just lay 
; there unused.  I have added it to my 'allinone' formula file at 
; this time because I have been doing more fractal exploring with 
; it recently.
; 
; The formula is a generalization of the cmplxmarksmand formula of 
; Fractint.  I made the change to see what would happen when other 
; powers of Z were given the same treatment.
; 
; Today's image is part of the parent fractal that results when 
; the exponent of Z is 1.4142 and the exponent of C is 0.4142.  
; The fractal itself is a roughly circular bay, with considerable 
; debris around the edges and a prominent valley jutting in on the 
; west side.  Today's scene is located in this western valley.
; 
; Though the detail surrounding the midget in the image consists 
; of the traditional equal-iteration bands, it is some of the most 
; fractured I have yet come upon.  I have no idea why the picture 
; inspired the name "Fractal Peach Pie", but that is the name I 
; gave it and that is the name it bears.
; 
; The image is not really all that impressive, especially consid-
; ering the 22 minutes required to render it, which results in an 
; overall worth of only 23.  The effort of running the included 
; parameter file may be avoided by downloading the finished GIF 
; file from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The continuation of the philosophy will appear in the philo-
; fractal version of the FOTD within a day or two.  Until then, 
; don't grow impatient.  Unlike foolishness, wisdom comes neither 
; quickly nor easily.
; 
; Bright sun prevailed all day Friday here at Fractal Central, but 
; the temperature never rose above 21F -6C, and this was simply 
; far too chilly for the delicate ears, paws and whiskers of the 
; fractal cats.  They passed the day on the shelf by the side 
; window, watching the birds.  Today is starting snowy, with a 
; temperature of 12F -11C.  The cats already know they will not be 
; going out, and seem to have accepted their confinement.
; 
; I plan on using the bad weather as an excuse to take it easy and 
; prepare for the chore of getting rid of the snow, which will 
; need to be done tomorrow.  The next FOTD will appear in all its 
; glory in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and step through life 
; with enthusiasm.
