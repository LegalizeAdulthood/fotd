; FOTD -- January 28, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There are everyday snails and there are snails of the Wonderland 
; variety, which, along with the caterpillars, sit on mushrooms, 
; smoking water pipes and blowing smoke letters into the air.  
; Today's image shows a highly decorated snail of the latter 
; variety, at a time when he is not smoking his pipe.
; 
; The curious little critter was created by the same formula that 
; gave us the orb that appeared in yesterday's FOTD.  But in 
; today's version we slightly shift the direction of the slice +3 
; and -3 degrees from the Julia aspect.  This small rotation opens 
; the figure and reveals considerable 'inside' area.  The 'fmod' 
; fill, with the proximity set to 1, adds the chaotic detail to 
; the 'inside' areas.
; 
; The final step in the creation of the snail was to stretch the 
; image in the vertical direction.  When this was done, the little 
; fellow came to life for all the world to see, sitting on his 
; abstract mushroom, wondering what happened to his pipe.
; 
; Snails are not my favorite animals.  They make quite boring 
; pets, and they don't taste good either, so a rating of 6 was the 
; best I could do with the image.  But the rendering takes less 
; than a minute, so it is worth the little bit of effort required 
; to see the snail on his mushroom.  The name "Snail on Mushroom" 
; is the only name that could have been given to an image like 
; today's.
; 
; For the convenience of those who dislike rendering snails, the 
; image is available in all the glory it can muster on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The next round of enlightening philosophy is a few days off.  
; But be patient.  The best (or craziest) part is yet to come.
; 
; It was colder than a w-----'s t-t here at Fractal Central on 
; Thursday.  The wind was up and the temperature never rose above 
; 21F -6C, but the sun was strong, and just enough sunlight struck 
; the porch to make conditions bearable for the cats, who spent a 
; full 45 minutes chasing the moving sunbeams that filtered 
; through the upper branches of the holly trees.  When the 
; sunbeams were gone, the duo came inside without the need to be 
; called, to enjoy their treat of tuna.  Today is starting even 
; colder.  Luckily, the sun is once again strong.  The cats should 
; have another acceptable day.
; 
; My other work is light, which means more time for fractals and 
; more time to prepare the next eagerly awaited outburst of 
; philosophy.  Until we meet again in 24 hours, take care, and I 
; still have not decided whether fractals truly exist or whether 
; they are inventions of the human mind.
