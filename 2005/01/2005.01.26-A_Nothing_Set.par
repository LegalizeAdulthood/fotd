; FOTD -- January 26, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I wrote another quick new formula since yesterday's FOTD, and 
; gave it the impressive name 'multXYZWcompjb-min'.  The only 
; difference from yesterday's formula is that today's calculates 
; (-Z) instead of (Z).  The difference in the formula is small, 
; but the change in the appearance of the fractals with fractional 
; exponents of Z is great.
; 
; Today's fractal shows a scene in the four-dimensional Julibrot 
; of the formula (-Z)^1.4142*C^0.03+C.  The orientation of the 
; slice is very close to the Julia direction.  But being close 
; does not make today's image a Julia set, so I have named it "A 
; Nothing Set".
; 
; The true Julia set may be seen by changing the value of (p1) 
; from 81,90.2 to 90,90.  The Mandelbrot aspect of the scene 
; appears when (p1) is set at 0,0.  The point that corresponds to 
; today's image lies in the disconnected triangle in the M-set.  
; The other values of (p1) draw various oblique slices through the 
; Julibrot, some of which are quite interesting, while others have 
; little to offer.
; 
; The image relies mostly on intense coloring for its effect.  As 
; a result I limited its rating to a 7.  But the render time is a 
; fast 2-3/4 minutes, which boosts the overall worth to 257.  And 
; don't forget the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the completed GIF image has or soon will be posted for the 
; convenience of those who would prefer to leave the rendering to 
; someone else.
; 
; The clouds hung tough most all day on Tuesday here at Fractal 
; Central, but the temperature rose to 36F 2C, which was comfort-
; able enough for the fractal cats.  Unfortunately, the warmer 
; temperatures started melting the snow, which then wet the paws 
; of the duo, sending them scurrying back to the porch, where they 
; sat for nearly an hour watching the birds fly by.  The evening 
; treat of tuna was a bit larger than average.  Today is starting 
; warmer with lots of clouds.  But with so much snow still on the 
; ground, it looks doubtful that the duo will have a good day.
; 
; Since the work is still caught up, my day will be good.  And 
; when 24 hours have passed, the next FOTD will appear in all its 
; glory and wisdom.  Until then, take care, and be awe-struck in 
; the presence of a fractal.
