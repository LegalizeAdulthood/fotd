; FOTD -- January 02, 2005 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I relaxed most all day yesterday.  Maybe I relaxed too much, for 
; in the evening, when the time for fractals came, some unexpected 
; visitors arrived, and I had to forego my trip to Fractal Land.  
; As a result I found myself this morning with FOTD post time near 
; and no FOTD to post.  But there is always the Mandelbrot set to 
; fall back on in such emergencies.
; 
; For today's image, I went to the valley of a minor sub-bud on 
; the northern shoreline of the third bud out the main stem.  To 
; add to the interest, I rendered the scene with the 'outside' set 
; to 'fmod' and the 'proximity' set to a rather small 0.0004.  I 
; chose the blue color theme to increase the feeling of infinity.
; 
; The name "Beyond the Infinite" was the best I could come up with 
; on such short notice.  And the time really is short.  It is so 
; short that I have yet to see a full-sized rendering of today's 
; image.  I did all the coloring work on the 3.16x reduction thumb-
; nail image that I use for exploring.  The render time of 50 
; minutes is an educated approximation based on the fact that the 
; thumbnail rendered in 5 minutes and 2 seconds.
; 
; The rating of a 4 is not all that might be hoped for, and when 
; the render time is considered, it gives an overall worth of only 
; 8.  Perhaps the best way to see the image is to download it from 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The new year seems plagued with disappointment.  Not only is the 
; FOTD falling behind, the philosophy is doing even worse.  But 
; the year still has 363 days yet to go -- plenty of time for deep 
; philosophizing.
; 
; Under brilliant sunshine the temperature reached 67F 19.5C here 
; at Fractal Central on Saturday.  Needless to say, the two 
; fractal cats were quite happy, and enjoyed a full afternoon in 
; the yard.  Even the pesky crows were gone.  But today is 
; starting quite cloudy and notably cooler.  The day will not be 
; as good, that much is for sure, but just how bad will it be?  
; Check back in 24 hours to find out.  Until then, take care, and 
; what event failed to take place on January 12, 1992?
