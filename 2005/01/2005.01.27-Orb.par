; FOTD -- January 27, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a Julia set of the fractal that results when 
; both Z and C are raised to the power 1.4142 and multiplied 
; together, and then C is added.  It consists of gaudily colored 
; but broken concentric circles with an interesting area of chaos 
; toward the center.
; 
; Most of the effect was achieved by calculating the formula with 
; the outside set to 'tdis'.  The chaotic parts of the image are 
; filled with curious but hard-to-find Julia basins, one of which 
; appeared two days ago as the 'Hairy Caterpillar' FOTD for 
; January 25.
; 
; I gave the image the name "Orb".  The name was inspired by the 
; nature of the image itself, which basically consists of nothing 
; but circles.  After a modicum of consideration, I rated it at a 
; not-bad 7.  The colors are a bit too brilliant, but still 
; striking.
; 
; The 'passes=b' option is fastest with this image, rendering the 
; entire scene in only 11 seconds.  This option often is the 
; fastest, but it must be used with caution because it can easily 
; miss important isolated features.  The render time of under 11 
; seconds is true only when the image is rendered with the passes 
; set to 'b'.
; 
; I have discontinued the overall worth rating, which was weighted 
; too heavily in favor of the render time.  No one paid much 
; attention to it anyway.  The only important thing is the appear-
; ance of the completed image, which is covered in the rating that 
; appears in the subject line of every FOTD.
; 
; The image is a very fast one.  By the time this letter is read, 
; it should already be posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The continuation of the philosophy that we have been waiting for 
; appears in the philofractal version of today's FOTD discussion.
; 
; The sky was mostly cloudy, but the temperature reached a high of 
; 47F 8C here at Fractal Central on Wednesday.  Only the wet 
; sloppy snow kept the fractal cats on the porch.  Today is 
; starting sunny but much colder.  The temperature is down to 10F 
; -12C, and the snow has frozen rock hard.  I wonder what the 
; dynamic duo will make of it.
; 
; My only problem is where to find the next FOTD.  The search will 
; begin in a few hours.  Until that next FOTD appears, take care, 
; and be serene as a fractal.
