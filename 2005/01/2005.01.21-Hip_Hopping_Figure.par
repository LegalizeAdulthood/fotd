; FOTD -- January 21, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is an outzoom of the 'Golden Rectangle' image of 
; January 18, which is a scene in a Julia set of the formula 
; Z^(2.003)+C.  I even went so far as to reuse the color palette 
; from that image.  The original rectangle is still intact, quite 
; visible at the point where the arms branch off from the main 
; figure.  This fractal area and color palette also appeared in 
; the 'Mainline Railroad' image of January 19, where we examined 
; the Mandelbrot aspect of the scene.
; 
; I named today's image "Hip-Hopping Figure".  This does not imply 
; that I enjoy the so-called 'music' which goes by that name.  In 
; fact I would never listen to it.  The name was chosen because 
; the central figure resembles a person caught up in a wild 
; twisting dance.
; 
; The image has a lively, joyous feeling to it, which earns a 
; rating of 7.  When the rating is adjusted for the render time of 
; just under 2 minutes, the overall worth equals an impressive 
; 377.  All this rating stuff can be bypassed by downloading the 
; completed GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; I might devote the month of February to exploration of this 
; particular area of the Z^(2.003)+C Julibrot.  We'll see how it 
; goes.
; 
; A bit more of the promised philosophical pondering is included 
; in the philofractal version of this FOTD.
; 
; A cloudy cold (34F 1C) day on Thursday here at Fractal Central 
; kept the fractal cats outdoor time limited to two brief trips to 
; the holly thicket, where the birds were finishing off the last 
; of the holly berries.  Both times when I called them, they came 
; without hesitation.  Their evening was uneventful.  This morning 
; is starting bright and sunny but, at a temperature of 14F -10C, 
; it is quite cold.  It will not be the best of days for the 
; dynamic duo.
; 
; For me the work is about average, which means anywhere from 
; three to eight hours, depending on how efficient I am.  Then 
; it's back to the world of fractals.  Until next FOTD, take care, 
; and be lively.
