; FOTD -- January 25, 2005 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It is rare that a hairy caterpillar comes squirming out of the 
; fractal computer (unless it is an Apple, that is), but this is 
; exactly what happened last evening, and today's image is the 
; evidence.  The object in today's image is a Julia basin in one 
; of the Z^1.4142 sets.  It looks so much like a big fat squishy 
; caterpillar that I could not resist the urge to name it "Hairy 
; Caterpillar".
; 
; The image was created by the new 'mult-XY-ZW-compjb' formula 
; that I recently wrote.  The same scene could have been found 
; with a simpler formula, but I prefer today's formula, which can 
; switch between the Mandelbrot and Julia, as well as the other 
; aspects of a scene, with little difficulty.
; 
; The rating of an 8 does not imply that I enjoy hairy caterpil-
; lars.  Actually, I am neutral about them, and it is hardly the 
; time of year when caterpillars are out and about in this part of 
; the world anyway.  I gave the image such a high rating because 
; of the extraordinary definition of the basin at the center, with 
; its odd set of holes.
; 
; When the rating is combined with the render time of 19 minutes, 
; the overall worth registers a 42.  Somehow, the image seems 
; better than that.  In fact, I'm less than satisfied with this 
; whole overall worth thing.  I think I'll stop rating the FOTD 
; images for overall worth, or start figuring the rating in a 
; different manner.  The present method gives far too much impor-
; tance to the render time.
; 
; And the overall worth rating really is pretty useless.  The 
; render time becomes just a curiosity when the completed GIF 
; image is downloaded from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The Morning sun on Monday turned to clouds by 1:00pm and snow by 
; 4:00pm.  Only about 1/2 inch (1cm) fell, but it proved to the 
; cats that a trip outdoors was out of the question.  Their excite-
; ment was limited to watching the snow from their shelf by the 
; window.  The boredom was eased by a treat of tuna mixed with 
; bits of cheddar cheese.  Today is starting milder, but it is 
; still below freezing and the sky is cloudy.  Let us hope for 
; better things for the fractal duo.
; 
; For me, only a little commercial work waits to be accomplished, 
; and then it's back to the fractals.  Until 24 hours have passed, 
; take care, and a fractal a day is better than tuna at keeping 
; boredom away.
