; FOTD -- January 23, 2005 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I am not sure that today's image truly rates the 9 that I have 
; given it, but it is certainly one of the better FOTD's.  The 
; image, which shows the entire parent fractal, was created by the 
; JimsCompMand formula.  This formula can increase the number of 
; arms in Mandel-type fractals, and it can also reduce the number 
; of arms, as it has done in today's image, where the Z^(-1000) 
; Mandeloid has had its arms reduced from 1001 to merely 3.
; 
; This reduction in the number of arms brings out the delicate 
; intricacy of the high-order fractals with negative exponents and 
; large escape radii.  The natural delicate effect was enhanced in 
; today's image by the softly-glowing background, which was 
; created with the 'bof60' inside fill and a bit of applied color 
; theory.  The black-to-orange shading of the foreground elements 
; was achieved by setting the outside to 'fmod' and the proximity 
; to a very high 1650.
; 
; The effect of delicacy can be made stronger by increasing the 
; escape radius beyond the 1100 that was used in the image.  When 
; this is done, the foreground elements gradually grow smaller.  I 
; assume they would eventually disappear entirely, though I have 
; not taken the escape radius this far.  Changing the inside and 
; outside fills also creates interesting effects.  The 'bof61' and 
; 'atan' inside fills are particularly effective, as are several 
; of the other outside options.
; 
; I named the image "Mysterious Triangle", though there is really 
; nothing very mysterious about it -- except that it is a fractal 
; -- and we know how mysterious they are.
; 
; The rating of a cosmic 9 and the brief render time of 1-1/2 
; minutes combine to create an image with an overall worth of 577. 
; This is not the highest overall worth of all time, but those 
; higher worths are somewhat artificial, having been achieved by 
; render times of only a few seconds.
; 
; As always, the finished image is available on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy snow fell all afternoon Saturday here at Fractal Central, 
; piling up to a depth of 6in 15cm.  The temperature reached a 
; high of only 16F -9C.  The fractal cats took one brief smell of 
; the outside air and decided that their adventure would be more 
; comfortable on the window shelf.  A treat of extra tuna in the 
; evening insured their contentment.  Today is starting cloudy.  
; The snow has ended, but the temperature is 12F -11C, and the 
; high winds are blowing the snow into drifts.  The duo have 
; already accepted that it will be another inside day.
; 
; For me, the task is to clear the driveway and sidewalk, but 
; before tackling that job I will wait for the drifting snow to 
; settle down.  The delay will give me a chance to find another 
; fractal hopefully as good as today's.  The next FOTD will appear 
; in 24 hours.  The vaguely fractal philosophy might or might not 
; be included.  Until then, take care, and see the light.
