; FOTD -- January 10, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's scene we return to the most important fractal of 
; all, the Mandelbrot set, to check the north branch of the 
; valley of the large period-5 bud on the northwest shore of the 
; main bay.  We wander quite deep into one of the seahorse spirals 
; on the outside of the valley, though at this point of the M-set 
; I am undecided whether the spirals are more like seahorse tails 
; or elephant trunks.
; 
; We end up at a rather routine midget.  The midget itself is 
; nothing that has not been seen many times before, and by itself 
; would rate a 5.  The extra brilliant coloring however raises the 
; rating to a 6.  When the render time of one minute is taken into 
; consideration, the overall worth equals a resounding 559.
; 
; The magnitude of the image is right on the border of arbitrary 
; precision math.  When the image is rendered with conventional 
; math, it finishes in one minute.  When arbitrary precision math 
; is used, the image drags on for an hour.  The difference in 
; appearance between the images drawn by the two rendering methods 
; is very small, so I have inserted the mathtolerance entry into 
; the included parameter file to insure that the very speedy 
; conventional math is used.
; 
; I named the image "Fractal Delicacy".  At this depth, the 
; spirals are delicate indeed, and do not quite resemble anything 
; in the 'real' world.  Thr best way to see the delicacy is to run 
; the parameter file.  Those with machines that fight the program 
; may wish to download the image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The next installment of philosophy is included in the 
; philofractal version of this discussion.
; 
; The fractal weather was questionable on Sunday here at Fractal 
; Central.  We had many clouds, a little sun, some wind, but no 
; rain.  The temperature of 48F 9C made conditions acceptable to 
; the fractal cats, who spent several hours on the porch, hoping 
; for an occasional shaft of sunlight to filter through to the 
; porch, and several more hours clearing the holly thicket of 
; stray cats.  Actually, Tippy did the clearing.  He is the tough, 
; wiry tabby.  Thomas, the lazy, oversized yellow-orange one, just 
; sat there and watched the intruder dash away up the hill to 
; where he belongs.  This morning is starting pleasant enough.  
; The duo should have another good day.
; 
; My day will be good when I have the work under control.  From 
; the way things are going, the next FOTD will appear in 3 or 4 
; days, when, if nothing unexpected happens, I should have a full 
; week of nearly complete FOTD's on file and ready to go, enabling 
; me to resume the regular daily schedule.  So until late in the 
; week, take care, and as you go through life, wonder about your 
; trip.
