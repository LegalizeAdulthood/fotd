; FOTD -- January 18, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The morning started with an unwanted e-mail with a subject line 
; that read, 'hey jamster i found what you were looking for'.  I 
; was quite puzzled, for I had no idea who jamster is or what he 
; was looking for.  But all the sender wanted was to sell him 
; something or other that he did not need, so no damage was done.  
; I deleted the letter to the trash bin and got to the fractal.
; 
; In today's image we return to one of my favorite fractal 
; objects, the mysterious rectangle that exists in the C=-1.7435,0 
; Julia set of the formula Z^(2.003)+C.  To make things a bit more 
; interesting I added the small imaginary value of 0.00025 to C.  
; The imaginary addition gives the whole scene a twist, making an 
; image worthy of the status of FOTD.
; 
; I named the image "Golden Rectangle".  One glance at the picture 
; will reveal why I chose the name.  The render time of 3-1/2 
; minutes is certainly within reason, and results in an overall 
; worth of 173.
; 
; For the convenience of those who do not enjoy rendering, the 
; completed GIF image will soon be ready for download on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The next installment of 'philosophy' is included in the 
; philofractal version of today's discussion.
; 
; It was partly cloudy but very cold here at Fractal Central on 
; Monday.  The temperature hovered around 23F -5C all afternoon, 
; which kept the dynamic fractal cats safely indoors.  They needed 
; only to stick their noses out the door for a few seconds to know 
; that they would not want to be outside.  Their moods were not 
; too sullen, but I gave them an extra treat of tuna to be sure 
; they were happy.  This morning is starting even colder, with a 
; temperature of 12F -11C.  Luckily, we are well stocked with 
; tuna.
; 
; The work is still heavy, but never fear, I have spare FOTD's 
; waiting.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours, to continue 
; the high standards of the past 7-3/4 years.  Until that golden 
; moment arrives, take care, and of course you can.
