; FOTD -- September 24, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things are still a little busier than I would like here at 
; Fractal Central today, so there will be no time for a long 
; rambling discussion.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image, which is based on the 
; square root of 2, is sliced 1234 levels down the complex log 
; spiral.  At this lowly level, the parent fractal is little more 
; than a lopsided circle with hints of tiny buds, but as today's 
; FOTD shows, it holds no shortage of midgets.
; 
; The rather striking scene is located in some explosive chaos on 
; the western shore of the main and only bay of its parent.
; 
; I am losing track of the number of consecutive 7-rated images we 
; have had.  I think today's is number 8 in a row.
; 
; The name "Square Root of 2-2" indicates that the image is the 
; second in the series of images investigating fractals generated 
; with the expression Z^(sqrt(2))+C.  The series will continue 
; until I grow bored.
; 
; The render time of 4+ minutes is within reason, but those who 
; are having an unreasonably impatient day may download the 
; finished GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; In a recent letter to the list, someone wondered where I get the 
; color maps I use in the FOTD fractals.  The answer is, anywhere 
; I can find them.  Sometimes the program produces a satisfactory 
; color map with a strike of the 'enter' key, and all I need to do 
; is tweak a few troublesome registers.  At the other extreme, I 
; occasionally create the entire map one register at a time, which 
; is a slow process.  Occasionally I run the FOTD images through 
; an image-processing program such as Photoshop, though I never 
; make changes that cannot be entered into a Fractint parameter 
; file.  And finally, though my humility prevents me from admit-
; ting it, my profession does require at least a bit of artistic 
; sensitivity.  Some of it unavoidably rubs off on the FOTD 
; fractals.
; 
; With a high temperature of 93F 34C and increased humidity here 
; at Fractal Central on Friday, it was a bit too oppressive for 
; cat comfort.  But the showers never arrived, and the duo made 
; the best of the marginal conditions, lurking for several hours 
; in the holly thicket.  To ease their displeasure, I gave them a 
; bit of extra tuna in the evening.  Today is starting with 
; clouds and cooler temperatures.  I see no reason why the duo 
; should complain.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear, as it almost always does, in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and be peaceful.
