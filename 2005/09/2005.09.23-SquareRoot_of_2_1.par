; FOTD -- September 23, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Due to an unexpected small but rushed job, which needs to be 
; delivered by this afternoon, today's discussion will be brief.
; 
; Starting with today's image we will begin a series of FOTD's 
; that explore scenes in the fractals created by the formula 
; Z^(sqrt(2))+C.  These fractals are infinite in number, and all 
; are broken by discontinuities, but the midgets in them are 
; relatively easy to find, and though not as varied as those in 
; the classic Mandelbrot set, the midgets still have much variety. 
; The names will merely indicate the number of each image in the 
; series.  The name of today's image is "Square Root of 2-1", 
; which indicates it is the first in the series of images based on 
; the square root of 2.
; 
; Today's parent fractal is the one at ground level of the 
; MandelbrotBC2 formula.  In future FOTD's we will investigate 
; other levels reached by this formula.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is the seventh consecutive such rating.  The 
; render time of 1-1/2 minutes is blessedly brief.  The finished 
; image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With lots of sun, reasonable humidity, and a high temperature of 
; 86F 30C, Thursday turned out virtually perfect here at Fractal 
; Central, especially for the cats, who spent the afternoon hiding 
; in the holly thicket, making sure the cat from two doors down 
; the hill kept his distance.  With only a moderately heavy load 
; of work to finish, my day was not quite perfect, but it came 
; close.  Today is starting with some clouds and quite warm.  
; Possible showers are forecast for later.  We'll see how it goes. 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and dream of fractals.
