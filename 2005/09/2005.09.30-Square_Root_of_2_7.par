; FOTD -- September 30, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's lightning-fast FOTD continues the theme of the square 
; root of 2, but it does so in the Julia orientation.  There are 
; no midgets in Julia sets, so I have wasted no effort searching 
; for them in today's FOTD.  I have instead taken an entire Julia 
; set.  There is also no outside-inside image in today's FOTD.  I 
; have rendered the outside parts totally black and rendered the 
; inside parts with the inside set to 'fmod' with a proximity 
; value of 0.02.  What we have on the screen is actually the 
; inside of the entire ground-level Z^(sqrt(2))+C Julia set.  Its 
; C-value is 0.115.  The set has been rotated -90 degrees to give 
; it a Y-axis symmetry.
; 
; The resulting inside-only image reminds me for some reason of an 
; avacado, though I have given it only a catalog-listing name.  
; The rating of a 6 is some improvement, but not what I was hoping 
; for.
; 
; The image, which was calculated by the julzpower formula, is 
; extremely fast.  On my tired old machine it renders in 1/2 
; minute.  On the speediest units, if it runs at all, it will 
; finish in a few seconds.
; 
; Those who for some reason cannot or would rather not run the 
; included parameter file may see the avacado-colored image by 
; downloading it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The clouds hung heavy Thursday morning here at Fractal Central, 
; but the rain passed off quickly, and by 2pm it was sunny and 
; mild, with a temperature of 75F 24C.  The cats approved.  I did 
; not approve of the heavy work, but work is work, so I did what 
; needed to be done.  Today is starting sunny but chilly.  The 
; cats should find it acceptable.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours, minus the avacado.  Until then, take care, and dream of 
; the answer.
