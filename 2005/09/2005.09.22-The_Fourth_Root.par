; FOTD -- February 22, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In the northern hemisphere today is the first day of autumn.  
; In the southern hemisphere it is the first day of spring.  At 
; 2223 GMT the sun stands directly over the equator somewhere not 
; too far south of Hawaii.  For a brief moment, everything is in 
; balance, the great world fractal is motionless, and it is said 
; an egg will balance on its end.
; 
; This might be true in some parts of the world, but not here at 
; Fractal Central.  The only way I can make an egg stand upright 
; is to place it on a flat surface and prop it up with a few 
; grains of salt.  The big question would seem to be how the story 
; got started.  It is also said that the entire universe might be 
; a fractal, which would mean that eggs are fractals also.  But 
; there is nothing egg-like in today's striking image.
; 
; Today's fractal is part of the larger fractal that results when 
; the formula Z^(1.1892)+C is iterated at ground zero level of the 
; logarithmic spiral.  Actually, I should say 3.14159 levels down 
; the complex logarithmic hyperspiral spiral, for the number pi is 
; actually best considered ground level of the spiral.  (I might 
; write another formula, one that correctly sets ground level.)
; 
; The exponent of Z in today's image is 1.1892, and it is no acci-
; dent that this number is the fourth root of 2.  I chose this 
; value because the midgets are easier to find in fractals whose Z 
; exponents are roots of 2.  I really did not need to choose a 
; root of 2 however, for I have discovered a simple method of 
; finding those elusive hidden midgets in fractals with exponents 
; of Z between 1 and 2.
; 
; After giving today's image full consideration, I rated it at a 
; 7.  This is about the 6th consecutive rating of a 7, which is a 
; sign that, at least in my opinion, I am on a fractal roll.  The 
; name "The Fourth Root" is a simple description of the exponent 
; of Z.  The render time of 2 minutes is thankfully brief.  And as 
; for those with Fractint-deprived machines -- they can see the 
; image by downloading it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; An absolutely perfect day (we sure have been having a lot of 
; them lately) here at Fractal Central on Wednesday kept the 
; fractal cats contented.  Finishing the work early and finding a 
; good fractal kept me contented also.  Today is starting sunny 
; and only the slightest bit cooler.  It seems another good day 
; is coming up.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and don't ignore the minutiae.
