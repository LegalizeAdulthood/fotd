; FOTD -- September 21, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Toward the center of today's image, I see a feature that reminds 
; me of a nautilus.  And nautili always remind me of school.  In 
; Saint Martin's Catholic elementary school we studied the poem 
; "The Chambered Nautilus", a poem that is obviously about reincar-
; nation.  But reincarnation conflicts with the doctrine of the 
; Catholic Church, which teaches that we are given only one life 
; on earth, so the class somehow finished studying the poem 
; without hearing of the possibility that individuals might have 
; more than one life on earth in which to get it right.
; 
; Actually, there is no nautilus in today's image.  There is 
; nothing in it but paths taken by iterated points, which have 
; been colored according to the whims of one human being -- myself.
; 
; The image is a scene in the fractal that results when the 
; formula Z^(1.75)+C is iterated at a point 8 levels down the 
; logarithmic hyperspiral.  This parent fractal is a rather 
; unimpressive thing, kind of a half-there main bay of a lost 
; Mandelbrot set.  But it does have the remnants of an East 
; Valley, and the northern shore of this valley is filled with 
; debris containing midgets such as the one which appears at the 
; center of today's image.
; 
; I named the image "Chambered Nautili".  Actually, I see only one 
; nautilus in the image, but in the world of fractals, things 
; often come in infinities, so I made the assumption that more 
; nautili are hiding in the scene.
; 
; I rendered the image with the passes set to 'b'.  I chose this 
; method because it is always the most fun to watch in action, and 
; with this particular image it works correctly and is actually 
; faster than passes=g.
; 
; The rating of a 7 might be based on the fact that the color 
; theme of the image is blue and orange, my high-school colors.  
; The render time of 9-1/2 minutes is not too bad.  But it could 
; be better.  Perhaps the best way to see the nautilus is to 
; download the finished GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The clouds were plentiful here at Fractal Central on Tuesday, 
; and the temperature reached 88F 31C, but no rain fell, and the 
; fractal cats enjoyed a near-perfect day in the yard.  Today is 
; starting slightly cooler with full sun.  Another good day 
; appears to be on the way for the duo.  For me, little of note 
; is expected.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and be at ease.
