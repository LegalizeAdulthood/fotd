; FOTD -- September 18, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Something is wrong with today's image.  It is actually part of 
; the Mandelbrot set, but nothing in the M-set looks quite like 
; this.  The image looks as though it might be part of a fractal 
; created by some exotic formula.
; 
; The problem lies in the bailout radius, which in today's image 
; has been reduced to 1.  When the bailout radius is reduced to 
; less than 4, the M-set is simply not all there.  Some points of 
; the M-set that are normally trapped do wander beyond a radius of 
; 1, and when the bailout radius is set to 1, these points are 
; mistakenly plotted as escaping points.  Other points are plotted 
; as escaping after too few iterations.  A bailout of 1 removes 
; the entire negative stem of the M-set and a good part of the 
; large period-2 bud, while the part of the set that remains is 
; strangely changed.
; 
; The points that are plotted as escaping after too few iterations 
; form bulging rounded patches.  In today's image, these patches 
; plump up the normally zig-zag filaments in the Siegel-disk area 
; of the M-set, rounding them into the sinuous, strongly colored, 
; curving lanes we see in the image.
; 
; Today's image is hyper-something, but I can't decide what.  I 
; let the name go as "Hyper-Something".  The rating of a 7 might 
; be a bit inflated.  The coloring isn't really that great.  But 
; there is no doubt of the render time, which is a speedy 3-3/4 
; minutes.
; 
; The best part of all is that even the minor task of rendering 
; may be avoided by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the finished GIF image from there.
; 
; As I suspected might happen, no rain fell here at Fractal 
; Central on Saturday, but the temperature reached 90F 32C, and 
; this was too warm for the duo of fractal cats, who spent most of 
; the day indoors on their air-cooled shelf by the window, watch-
; ing the birds.  Today is starting clear and somewhat cooler.  
; Things are looking better for the duo.  For me, it looks like I 
; might have to go along on one of those antiquing expeditions.  
; But regardless of what else happens, the next FOTD will appear 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and don't get hyper.
