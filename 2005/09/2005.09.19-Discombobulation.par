; FOTD -- September 19, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the Z^(1.75)+C Mandeloid as it 
; appears 3 levels down the logarithmic spiral.  The parent 
; Mandeloid resembles a Mandelbrot set rotated so that its east 
; end is on the northwest and its main bud is on the southwest 
; side of the main bay.  All the parts are there, but they have 
; been eroded by the deficient exponent of 1.75.  Today's scene 
; is located in an area of chaos radiating from the south branch 
; of what passes for Seahorse Valley.
; 
; I named the image "Discombobulation", which might or might not 
; be a real word.  If it is a real word, it means 'the state of 
; having one's composure upset.'  I rated the image at an above-
; average 7, most likely in recognition of the extra effort I put 
; into coloring it.
; 
; The render time of 3-1/5 minutes should try no one's patience, 
; but there are those new-fangled machines out there, with those 
; new-fangled operating systems and new-fangled video cards that 
; don't get along with Fractint.  For the convenience of those 
; with such Fractint-challenged units, the finished GIF image has 
; been posted to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; from where it may conveniently be downloaded.
; 
; ;-)  And speaking of new-fangled stuff, I think this Fractint 
; incompatibility is part of a plot by a race of evil space aliens 
; from the Draconian Empire, who are turning us into helpless 
; technology-dependent wards, ready for easy enslavement.  They 
; say they only want to make our lives easier, but their real 
; goal is to make us totally dependent on the technology they are 
; giving us, which they will then unexpectedly withdraw, leaving 
; us helpless to resist their attack.  Watch carefully.  In a few 
; years they will start taking away our technological toys.
; 
; Keep your eyes on the inexpensive old-style TV sets and the 
; still-affordable vehicles powered by internal-combustion 
; engines, which are some of the few things still around that were 
; created by earth beings.  The Draconians are already plotting to 
; change the TV broadcast standards and make fuel for old-style 
; vehicles prohibitively expensive, so that these devices will 
; become useless.
; 
; When the man at the Super-Everything-Mart tells us we'll need to 
; buy super-expensive new-fangled TV's or hybrid vehicles that no 
; human being can understand, you will know that we have reached 
; the state of total dependency on Draconian technology, and the 
; big takeover is near.  Soon thereafter, the mobile phone 
; networks and internet will be shut down, leaving us absolutely 
; helpless, in a technological vacuum.  Hopefully, the Draconians, 
; who will rush in to save and enslave us, will give us at least 
; some choice as to what kind of slave labor we will be forced to 
; perform for them.  ;-)
; 
; The preceeding three paragraphs are not serious, or . . . no, it 
; couldn't be.
; 
; Partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 84F 29C here at Fractal 
; Central on Sunday kept the fractal cats quite content for the 
; afternoon.  This morning is starting about the same.  I expect a 
; similar day.  For me the day will hold both work and fractals.  
; Until the next FOTD appears in 24 hours, take care and always be 
; lucid.
