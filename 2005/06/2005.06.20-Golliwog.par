; FOTD -- June 20, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's fractal we enter new territory.  We are still 
; examining fractals with exponents slightly greater than whole 
; numbers, but we are combining various portions of two different 
; exponents.  In today's fractal, we have combined one part of 
; 2.00001 and 1/10 part of 4.00001 to produce an infinitely 
; divided main stem, creating an effect of a crazy railroad 
; switching yard, but with different inner details.
; 
; At such an early stage of exploration, I have barely scratched 
; the surface of what might exist in the depths of such fractals.  
; I have much more exploration to do before I can come to any 
; conclusion about the potential of today's line of investigation. 
; Luckily, the commercial work is still slow, (in fact, it's a bit 
; too slow), and this will give me lots of time to spend in 
; fractal land, exploring today's theme.
; 
; I named today's image "Golliwog".  The image is not really so 
; grotesque as to deserve that name, but the word is one that is 
; not heard very often, so the name will remain.  Actually, I'm 
; not quite sure what a golliwog is.  I seem to have the 
; impression that it is an ugly, animated doll, perhaps appearing 
; in a story I once read.
; 
; Today's rating of 7 is an improvement over yesterday's sagging 
; rating.  The render time of 19-1/2 minutes on my lazy 10-year-
; old machine is still slow, but the image is at least more 
; worthy of the effort.  Those with machines that suffer knee-jerk 
; reactions to Fractint and its old VESA video modes will need to 
; download the finished image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy clouds hung overhead all day Sunday here at Fractal 
; Central, but no rain fell, which made conditions quite 
; satisfactory for the fractal cats, who spent most of the 
; afternoon in the holly thicket, enjoying the temperature of 73F 
; 23C.  They needed only a small treat of tuna in the evening to 
; keep them in a good mood.  Today is starting with clouds and 
; rather chilly temperatures.  It remains to be seen how the duo 
; will take these conditions.
; 
; For me the work awaits, so I had best get started.  The next in 
; the endless string of fractals will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and I might know everything about everything, 
; but I still don't know what it is that does the knowing.
