; FOTD -- June 23, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After re-reading today's discussion, I almost hit the delete key 
; and wiped out the following five paragraphs, which are more 
; political than fractal.  But at the last second I withheld my 
; finger and let the OT paragraphs stay.  Those who are annoyed by 
; political bluster should skip to the fractal discussion, which 
; begins 6 paragraphs below.
; 
; How can I possibly get the energy to produce a new FOTD almost 
; every day?  Why, after 17 years of playing with fractals, have I 
; not grown bored with the chaotic things?  Why don't I put more 
; effort into being a proper fractal artist rather than a fractal 
; explorer?  Maybe I enjoy co-existing with nature as it is, and 
; dislike trying to bend it to my desires.
; 
; And why do I still use 15-year-old DOS programs, (Fractint and 
; WordPerfect 5.1), to produce the FOTD, when the more modern 
; Windows X.XX programs are so much more trendy?  Maybe it's for 
; the same reason that I don't have a web site and don't own a 
; hand-held mobile telephone.  (And how do I get along without 
; these necessary things? -- Very well indeed!)
; 
; Maybe some of the old ways of doing things were simply better.  
; For example, there were once days when schools actually taught 
; students the skills they need to be productive in our society.  
; Fractal lady has a friend who teaches 7th grade in the Baltimore 
; City school system, or perhaps I should say used to teach in the 
; school system.  She visited Fractal Central last evening and 
; began talking about her situation.  Her contract was not renewed 
; because she was causing trouble by actually failing some of her 
; students.  She failed them because they had not done the work 
; needed to pass.  It is not that they tried to do the work and 
; needed more help.  They did not even try.  In fact, on half the 
; days they didn't even show up for class.
; 
; She showed us a 5th-grade reader that was published in 1896, and 
; compared it with the writing that her 7th-grade students had 
; produced.  The old 5th-grade reader looked like a present-day 
; college-level text, while the writing her students had done 
; would have been considered 2nd-grade level in 1896.  None of 
; this is new to me, but it certainly supports my conviction that 
; something has gone wrong in the past century, and I doubt it is 
; mankind who is growing less intelligent.
; 
; Fractal lady's friend is a fine teacher, and has already found a 
; position in another school system.  As she was leaving F.C. I 
; jokingly told her to use fractals to add a bit of interest to 
; her next class.  They certainly make life more interesting for 
; me.  For all I know, she actually might do it.
; 
; To create today's FOTD I took just plain Z and subtracted the 
; tiniest part of Z^1000 from it before adding C.  Or one could 
; say I took the tiniest negative part of Z^1000 and combined it 
; with just plain Z before adding C.  The result is the same -- a 
; fractal with the nature of high-order Mandeloids but without the 
; lacy effect.
; 
; Today's scene is located on the positive X-axis of its parent, 
; very near the origin.  Due to the intense amber coloring, it 
; rates a 7.  When the time came to name the image, I could think 
; of nothing that describes it, and left it without a name, the 
; word "Un-Named" serving as a kind of name.
; 
; The render time of 20 minutes is on the slow side.  Relief is 
; available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A mixture of clouds and sun, and a temperature of 84F 29C kept 
; the fractal cats busy taking it easy on Wednesday.  In the 
; evening, when distant thunder started grumbling and a short 
; shower fell, the duo decided it was time to come inside.  The 
; threatening storm never materialized, and the cats celebrated by 
; devouring a hefty treat of tuna.  Today is starting sunny and 
; cooler.  It looks like another good day coming for the duo.  For 
; me, the work is picking up, but is not yet enough to conflict 
; with the fractal exploration.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and do as you will.
