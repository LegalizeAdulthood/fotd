; FOTD -- June 09, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Alert: the next paragraph is non-fractal in nature.  The fractal 
; fun starts in the paragraph after the next.
; 
; When I opened my e-mail this morning, I noticed a letter from 
; Earthlink, my ISP, informing me that my password had been 
; changed and I would not be allowed to access my e-mail until I 
; checked in at their web site and re-entered my info.  Curiously, 
; if this were actually the case, I never would have been able to 
; access my mailbox to read the letter telling me that I could not 
; access my e-mail.  And what right does Earthlink have to change 
; my password?  I thought it was up to me to decide if and when to 
; change it.  I get so many of these fraudulent letters that I am 
; beginning to suspect we have a new industry emerging.  At least 
; none of them complain about the hot weather.
; 
; I named today's fractal image "Daisies in the Field" because 
; that's what it reminds me of.  The image is a pleasant diversion 
; from the world of winning phony lotteries, phishing scams, and 
; hot weather.  It is a picture of an invisible midget.  Yes, such 
; things actually do exist, and we have one at the center of 
; today's frame.
; 
; To see the invisible midget in all its non-glory, simply change 
; the inside fill to 'numb' and re-calculate the fractal.  Don't 
; wait too long, for nothing will appear but a blank screen.  The 
; midget and the whole parent fractal as well have become 
; invisible.  Everything has evaporated.
; 
; Sometimes these 'evaporated' versions are better than anything 
; done in the normal manner.  At other times they are worthless.  
; In today's case, the evaporated version is one of the better 
; ones, though several other versions are good enough that they 
; could have been chosen instead.
; 
; The formula combines Z^(-1.4) and Z^(-4.1) before adding (1/C) 
; to produce a typical 'inside-out' parent fractal.  The rating of 
; 6 and render time of under 5 minutes make it all marginally 
; worth the effort.  The completed image is available on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A temperature of 93F 34C on Wednesday here at Fractal Central 
; kept the cats in the coolest spot they could find, which 
; happened to be their window shelf, from where they could watch 
; birds and keep cool at the same time.  I kept my cool by 
; finishing some work and not worrying about global warming.  
; Today is starting the same, so the duo will likely have another 
; day by the window.  The next FOTD will appear as always in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and wait for the new age.
