; FOTD -- June 06, 2005 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is not the ultimate goal of Sunday's fractal 
; adventure, but it is an interesting scene that appeared on the 
; way.  The ultimate goal will appear as the FOTD for June 07.  
; Since I have not yet reached that goal, I have little idea of 
; what I will find there.  I know only that it should be 
; interesting.
; 
; The formula is a new one that calculates Mandelbrot fractals 
; with both variable escape radii and powers of Z.  I might make a 
; few speed-up changes in it before making it permanent, but it 
; works well enough as it is for today's image.
; 
; The name "Simply Simple" means nothing other than what it 
; implies.  Of course, there is nothing simple about fractals, 
; which are some of the most complex things found in nature, if 
; indeed nature is where fractals exist.  (They might exist only 
; in the mind.)
; 
; The rating of a 4 is below average.  Since the image is only a 
; way-station, I could rate it no higher.  The below-average 
; rating is made up for however by the render time, which is a 
; sizzling 35 seconds.
; 
; For the convenience of those with handicapped (challenged in PC 
; language) computers, the completed image is available on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; 88-degree (31C) heat and high humidity kept the fractal cats 
; confined to the shade of the holly thicket on Sunday.  But at 
; least they were outside, which is all that cats of the fractal 
; variety need to keep them happy.  Today is starting even warmer 
; and more humid.  I expect more of the same.  The next FOTD will 
; be ready in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and don't sweat it.
