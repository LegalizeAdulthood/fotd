; FOTD -- June 04, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal takes the 'just under 2' theme of yesterday,s 
; FOTD several steps further.  The exponent of Z in today's 
; fractal is 1.999999; the exponent of the extra C is 0.000001, 
; resulting in a fractal that on the surface cannot be 
; distinguished from the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; But a close examination of the exposed negative stem reveals 
; that things are not as they should be.  What at first appears to 
; be a single negative stem, turns out to be many.  The splitting 
; is not as chaotic as it is in fractals with exponents slightly 
; greater than 2, but there are still many new scenes to be 
; investigated in the area, especially in the East Valley area of 
; the large main-stem midget, which is where today's scene was 
; found.
; 
; I have named today's image "Just-Under Brot" because its parent 
; fractal is so close to being the Mandelbrot set, yet falls such 
; a tiny bit short.  The rating of a 7 is mostly due to the 
; coloring, which I put some extra effort into.  The render time 
; of 3-1/2 minutes is fast enough for all but the most impatient 
; fractalist, if there are such things as impatient fractalists, 
; that is.
; 
; The finished image is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Rain fell most all day Friday here at Fractal Central, keeping 
; the cats well ensconced indoors, where they passed the day on 
; their window shelf, watching birds.  A little extra tuna kept 
; them from becoming too unhappy.  Today is starting cloudy but 
; dry, and it is warmer.  The cats should approve.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and never stop searching for the universal fractal.
