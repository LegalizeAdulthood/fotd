; FOTD -- June 28, 2005 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I am sometimes asked why I have devoted so much effort over the 
; past eight years to searching for these elusive fractals and 
; writing mediocre-quality discussions about the things I find.  
; Taken together, the FOTD writings consume as much disk space as 
; almost 20 average-length novels.  That is a lot of writing.  I 
; am also asked why I don't put my writing energies into writing 
; articles or short stories.  Well, over the past 30 years, I have 
; written quite a few short stories, once again of mediocre qual-
; ity.  I have also written articles much like those I occasion-
; ally post on these lists -- of mediocre quality of course.  I 
; receive no monetary reward for my efforts, and very little fame.  
; But despite this, something drives me to continue.
; 
; Fractals are new worlds, and I fantasize about exploring new 
; worlds.  I suppose I am a bit resentful that I arrived too late 
; to explore the unknown regions of this world and apparently too 
; early to explore the unknown regions beyond.  (I use the word 
; apparently because I am becoming ever more convinced that, other 
; than an occasional lucky astronaut, men will never get into 
; space.  Earth simply lacks the resources to send a large number 
; of people into space.  Our physical needs are far too many, far 
; too specialized, and far too expensive for mass space travel to 
; ever be practical.)
; 
; Exploring fractals is ersatz space exploration, which is why I 
; never grow bored with it.  Whether it is worth the effort is 
; another story.  Sometimes I start to think it is not, but then a 
; great fractal turns up, and my waning enthusiasm is boosted.  
; Unfortunately, today's below-average effort will do little 
; boosting.
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the fractal that results when (1/Z) 
; and Z^(-2) are combined and (1/C) is added.  With its colored 
; disks and patches, the image is very typical of those found in 
; fractals created with negative exponents of Z.  For some reason, 
; I named it "Nest of Termites".  This is termite season, after 
; all.
; 
; The rating of a 4 seems justified for an image that impresses me 
; as being just another in an endless series of similar fractals.  
; The render time of under 4 minutes assures that not too much 
; effort will be wasted in rendering the image from the included 
; parameter file.
; 
; For the convenience of those who would rather not or, or because 
; of over-qualified computers, cannot render Fractint parameters, 
; the pre-rendered GIF image is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The temperature of 82F 28C here at Fractal Central on Monday was 
; fair enough, but the frequent and sudden rain showers kept the 
; fractal cats confined to the shelter of the porch.  When a tough 
; neighborhood tomcat ventured into the yard, Tippy exerted enough 
; effort to chase it back where it belongs, but when the yard was 
; clear of intruders, he returned to the porch to wash himself 
; dry.  Thomas watched the action from his cozy nest on the porch 
; chair.  Today is starting sunny and warmer.  If no showers come 
; up, it should be a fine day for the duo.  For me, the work is 
; increasing, so I had best get busy.  Until the next FOTD appears 
; 24 hours from now, take care, and if life is rough, take heart.  
; It won't last forever.
