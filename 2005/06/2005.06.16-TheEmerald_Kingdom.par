; FOTD -- June 16, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It is sometimes said that advertising is filled with subliminal 
; messaging -- hidden images and sounds that act directly on the 
; subconscious, turning the reader or viewer, without his being
; aware of it, into a proper consumer, who finds himself filled 
; with unexplained and uncontrollable urges to go out and spend 
; his hard-earned money on something he doesn't need and would be
; better off without.
; 
; When I first heard this claim, I didn't believe it.  After all, 
; can't any child find hidden faces in clouds.  The brain has a 
; great ability to imagine familiar things in random shapes.  I 
; assumed that those who told me they saw dirty pictures in 
; advertising illustrations simply had dirty minds.  But even 
; though I wasn't convinced that the subliminal stuff others told 
; me about is actually there, I started looking for it in the ads 
; in the magazines I read.  I soon found enough to make a believer 
; of me.  Some of it is so obvious that it is hard to see how it 
; can be considered subliminal.  Advertising has many levels.  It 
; is filled with things that are not immediately apparent.  And 
; much of this hidden content is sexual in nature.  The effect-
; ivness of this technique is another question, but it is curious 
; that I see those who lived 40 years without a hand-held mobile 
; phone now claiming that they could never survive without one.
; 
; I mention subliminal advertising because I found myself scanning 
; today's fractal for subliminal images.  I found a few vague 
; shapes that could be faces, but these are simply a demonstration 
; that we can find faces most anywhere.  Arrange any three 
; splotches in a roughly triangular pattern and the mind will see 
; two eyes and a mouth.  Luckily, the only thing I am trying to 
; sell is fractals.
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the East Valley of the large midget 
; on the main stem of the large midget on the main stem of the 
; Z^(2.000000003)+C almost-Mandelbrot set.  (HAH)  I named it "The 
; Emerald Kingdom" because of its colors.  Once again, the image 
; is so fractured that the breaks create the shape of the features.
; 
; I rated the image at a 7.  I would have given it an 8, but I 
; have been doing quite a lot of work with similar images lately, 
; and they are beginning to seem routine.  The render time of 18 
; minutes is on the slow side.  Full relief for the fractal delay 
; may be found at:

; 
; With a high temperature of only 88F 31C, more breeze, less 
; humidity, and more clouds, Wednesday was a far more pleasant day 
; at Fractal Central, both for man and cats.  The duo spent over 
; five hours exploring the yard, and ended the day with a generous 
; treat of tuna.  Today is starting even cooler.  It looks like 
; another good day for the cats.  The next in the near-endless 
; series of FOTD fractal images will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and incredibly, we learned enough to invent 
; computers in classrooms without computers.
