; FOTD -- June 17, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The FOTD rating continues to slip.  Two days ago it was 8; 
; yesterday it was 7.  Today's rating is down to a 6, which is 
; only a little above average.  I must do something about this 
; tendency to degradation before it gets out of control.  But even 
; a 6-rated fractal is worth consideration, so before we set out 
; in a new direction, let's consider today's image.
; 
; For today's fractal we go to the Z^(2.005)+C near-Mandeloid and 
; check the area around the large midget on the main stem.  When 
; we do this, the first thing we notice is that the stem has split 
; far enough for the large midget to have divided into two totally 
; disconnected midgets.  Between the two midgets lies an area of 
; mixed chaos and railyard features, filled with an abundance of 
; sub-midgets.  Today's scene is located near the point where one 
; of the railroad tracks merges into an area of chaos.
; 
; I named the image "Switched".  After all, one thing a railyard 
; is full of is switches.  Actually, the scene has more chaos than 
; railroad features, so a better name might have been something 
; like 'Chaotic Express' or 'Journey to Chaos'.  Regardless of the 
; name, the image renders in only 4 minutes, which makes it worth 
; the effort of rendering.  And the completed GIF image is always 
; available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; At this point, a bit of philosophy is included in the philofrac-
; tal version.
; 
; Thursday was near perfect here at Fractal Central.  The sky was 
; fair, the temperature reached only 84F 29C, and the humidity was 
; lower.  The cats showed their satisfaction by spending most of 
; the afternoon out of sight in the holly patch.  Today is start-
; ing the same.
; 
; For me it looks like another slow day.  Slow days are enjoyable, 
; but we don't want too many of them.  Slow day or not, the next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours, complete with fractal.  Until 
; then, take care, and take it easy.
