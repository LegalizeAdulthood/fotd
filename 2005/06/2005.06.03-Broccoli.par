; FOTD -- June 03, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have recently done several studies of what happens in the main 
; stem area of the M-set when the exponent of Z is increased very 
; slightly.  For today's fractal however, I checked what happens 
; when the exponent is reduced.
; 
; A problem immediately arose, since the main stem of the M-set 
; vanishes when the exponent of Z is less than 2.  Luckily, I have 
; a formula, JimsCompMand, that can pull the vanished stem from 
; its hiding place and place it in the full light of day, ready to 
; be checked.  The new formula is a generalization of the formula 
; 'cmplxmarksmand', which has been in Fractint for many years.
; 
; To produce today's image, I set the exponent of Z at 1.9 and the 
; exponent of the extra C at 0.09, which brings the main stem 
; barely out of hiding.  Then I checked the East Valley area of 
; the large stem midget.  Instead of the explosion in a switching 
; yard effect, I found large disconnected chunks scattered around 
; the scene in a near chaotic arrangement.  Today's FOTD image is 
; typical of the situation in the area.
; 
; I named today's picture "Broccoli", which is a vegetable I can't 
; get too much of.  I'm not quite sure why I gave it this name.  
; There must be something suggestive of broccoli somewhere in the 
; image, though at the moment I seem to have lost sight of it.
; 
; Despite being named after my favorite vegetable, today's FOTD 
; rates only an average 5, but its render time of a minute or so 
; makes up for the lack of superior quality.  Those who dislike 
; both broccoli and rendering fractals can see the image by down-
; loading it from the FOTD web site at:

;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The rain held off until after dark on Thursday here at Fractal 
; Central.  The temperature of 66F 19C was cool for the season, 
; but the cats didn't seem to mind as they passed the afternoon in 
; the holly thicket.  At one point another neighborhood cat roamed 
; into the yard, but when Tippy advanced on him ready to fight, 
; the intruder beat a hasty retreat.
; 
; Unfortunately, today is starting with rain in the area.  This is 
; bad for cats, but good for me, for it will give me a chance to 
; catch up on some work that is starting to back up.  The next 
; FOTD, which will appear in 24 hours, will probably be an improve-
; ment over today's, but check back to be sure.  Until then, take 
; care, and why is global warming always worse when it is summer 
; in the northern hemisphere?
