; FOTD -- June 26, 2005 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I think enough of today's near-integer Mandeloid image to rate 
; it at a 9.  The rating comes mostly from the coloring, which 
; happened by accident, with little talent involved on my part.  
; (And it's a good thing it was an accident.  I put little effort 
; into coloring the image.)
; 
; The parent fractal is the Z^3.0001+C Mandeloid, which is being 
; viewed fully 31415 levels up the complex logarithmic hyper-
; spiral, at a level where it has rotated 90 degrees and the 
; valley that normally lies at the bottom center of the south bud 
; now lies on the negative X-axis.  Today's scene is located in a 
; tiny bit of cut-off debris sitting unobtrusively in the middle 
; of the broadened valley.
; 
; Once again, violently cut-up features fill the scene, creating a 
; new pattern by their very numbers.  The resulting image reminds 
; me of nothing I am familiar with in the everyday world.  I 
; therefore named it "Jewel in the Lotus", a phrase which is (or 
; was) popular among those who do a lot of meditating.  I am not 
; sure what the lotus jewel is supposed to be.  Most likely it is 
; something mystical, far beyond human comprehension, as also are 
; fractals, so the name seems perfectly appropriate.
; 
; The render time of only 6-1/2 minutes is surprisingly fast for 
; such a spectacular image.  And even that short wait may be 
; eliminated by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the completed GIF image from there.
; 
; A hot temperature of 91F 33C here at Fractal Central on Saturday 
; did not deter the fractal cats from their habitual afternoon in 
; the holly patch.  When the day ended they returned inside with 
; no complaint to enjoy their treat of tuna.  Today is starting 
; the same.  For me, it looks like a lazy day coming up.  Maybe 
; I'll find excitement in Fractal Land.  The next FOTD will appear 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and see the light.
