; FOTD -- November 08, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When 0.00006 part of Z^100 is added to 0.6 part of Z^2, C is 
; added to the sum, and then the entire thing is reiterated 1,000 
; or so times, the result is a lopsided oval-shaped open area with 
; an area of chaos on its western end.  This chaotic area, which 
; contains strangely shaped midgets and buds that are more reason-
; ably shaped, holds most of the interest in the parent fractal.  
; Today's scene lies near the tip of the main filament extending 
; from the most prominent bud.
; 
; While searching for a name, I glanced out the window and noticed 
; a marigold plant totally covered with late-blooming flowers.  
; The name seemed to fit the feeling of the image, so that is what 
; I named today's FOTD.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is a little above average.  I put too little 
; effort into the coloring to rate the image higher.  What we have 
; is a tweaked random palette created by striking the 'enter' key. 
; In this particular case, it works fairly well.
; 
; The render time of 8-1/2 minutes might be considered a bit slow 
; by those with other things to do.  To speed things up, the 
; finished image is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; It turned cloudy and chilly before noon here at Fractal Central 
; on Monday.  The temperature of 63F 22C held the cats' outdoor 
; time to under an hour, but they made the most of the 50 minutes 
; when they ganged up on an oversized black cat that intruded in 
; the yard and put it to flight.  When they came inside soon 
; after, I rewarded them for their bravery with an extra serving 
; of tuna.  My day was about as close to average as days can come. 
; Today is starting sunny, but it is chilly again.  I don't know 
; how the cats will feel about this, but my day promises to be 
; moderately busy.  The next FOTD will appear 24 hours from now.  
; Until then, take care, and see through the mysteries.
