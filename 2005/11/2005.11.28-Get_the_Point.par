; FOTD -- November 29, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image pictures part of the empty inside of a Julia set 
; of the Z^(1.009)+C Mandeloid as it appears 109 levels up the 
; infinite logarithmic spiral.  This empty inside was brought to 
; life not by a bolt of lightning, as the Frankenstein monster 
; was, but by the bof60 inside fill.
; 
; So far, so good.  But something is wrong.
; 
; The image has no 'bof60' feeling to it.  It consists of a cloud 
; of floating daggers arranged into a large broken spiral, with 
; the bright blue background barely showing through.  Normally, 
; the bof60 inside fill produces a scene with circular bubbles, 
; much like the 'fmod' fill does.  It is this unexpected nature 
; of the image that adds the interest which raises the rating to 
; a 7.
; 
; Also interesting is the fact that the exponent of Z, at a value 
; of 1.009, is so close to unity, a value that does not make 
; fractals.  Curiously enough, in this almost-linear range, most 
; of the action is in the inside parts of the fractals.  The con-
; ventional inside-outside fractals tend to resemble rather boring 
; mis-shaped eggs.
; 
; The coloring appears quite full, but actually only 20 or so 
; different colors appear in the scene.  Luckily, 20 colors are 
; all that is needed to "Get the Point", which BTW is what I named 
; today's image.
; 
; The image is just the center part of the whole inside of the 
; parent fractal.  For an additional surprise do an outzoom and 
; check the entire parent, which is nothing like what one would 
; normally expect.
; 
; Today's FOTD render time of 8 minutes borders on slowness.  But 
; the finished image may be downloaded from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; which will eliminate the task of rendering.
; 
; The partly cloudy skies and mild temperatures of 68F 20C on 
; Monday here at Fractal Central were spoiled by occasional light 
; sprinkles and wet grass, which limited the cats' outdoor adven-
; ture time to under 30 minutes.  My outdoor time was limited by 
; the work that needed to be done after the holiday.  The next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and the 
; FOTD images will one day vanish, but the fractals themselves 
; are eternal.
