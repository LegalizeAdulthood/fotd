; FOTD -- November 10, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; ;-)      ;-)      ;-)      ;-)      ;-)      ;-)
; When I checked my e-mail box this morning, I found a letter 
; telling me that I had been selected to be included in the next 
; issue of Who's Who.  I have no idea what I have ever done that 
; makes me worthy of such honor.  I didn't realize that fractals 
; are so important.  I also wonder why the publishers need me to 
; submit my biography.  They must have already known of my great 
; fractals and my great graphic design ideas when they chose me 
; for inclusion.  But why did they notify me by sending a junky, 
; poorly-written e-mail letter in HTML format, padded by random 
; nonsense text?  One would expect the notification of such an 
; honor to arrive in a fancy snail-mail package or by a personal 
; phone call.  The next thing I know, they'll want me to pay for 
; the honor of inclusion, which would make it no honor at all.
; ;-)      ;-)      ;-)      ;-)      ;-)      ;-)
; 
; While thinking of what to do about this, I'll turn to today's 
; fractal, which is a Julia set of the Z^(1.5)+C Mandeloid as it 
; appears 15 levels up the logarithmic spiral.  The Mandelbrot 
; point of today's Julia image is located in a truncated valley of 
; the associated M-set.
; 
; I named the image "Crazy Trilobite".  For some reason it reminds 
; me of one of those long-extinct creatures that once crawled in 
; the slime of primordial sea floors.
; 
; The rating of a 7 seems appropriate.  Yes, I realize that the 
; image has only one layer, but when it comes to fractals, one 
; layer and a skilled fractalist are all that is needed.
; 
; The render time of 4-1/2 minutes on my machine means that no one 
; will be overly inconvenienced if they find the image not worth 
; the effort.  And as always, the completed fractal is available 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Despite the clouds that hung around all day Wednesday here at 
; Fractal Central, the rain never arrived and the temperature 
; reached 64F 18C.  This was good enough for the fractal cats, who 
; spent the afternoon out of sight in the holly thicket.  Today is 
; starting with sun and clouds, but the winds are up, and the cats 
; dislike high winds that hide the sound of danger.  We'll have to 
; see how it goes.  For me, the day coming up looks average.  The 
; next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, continue taking 
; care, and wonder why so much care is necessary.
