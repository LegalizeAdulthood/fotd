; FOTD -- November 25, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yesterday's discussion was short because I inadvertently deleted 
; the regular discussion and wrote over its disk space before I 
; realized the file was gone.  That's two discussions I've lost 
; this month.  'Wordperfect5.1', the DOS program I use, does not 
; have a waste basket.  The lost discussion was about oddities of 
; the fourth dimension and the three-dimensional slices of the 
; Z^2+C Julibrot.  One of these days I'll re-write it, but today 
; we have more immediate things to discuss.
; 
; Today's image is part of the inside of a Julia set of the 
; Z^1.15+C Mandeloid as it appears 55 levels down the spiral.  It 
; consists almost totally of inside stuff made visible by the 
; 'atan' inside fill, and is one of the most unusual all-inside 
; images I have seen.  The eight leaf-like features surrounding 
; the hole at the center at first appear symmetrical, but first 
; impressions are sometimes deceiving.  In addition to being 
; colored differently, each leaf has a slightly different shape 
; and a different inside pattern.
; 
; I named the image "All Inside Stuff" as a mere description.  I 
; rated it a 6 because I feel it is at least slightly above 
; average.  The render time of the parameter file, just under 8 
; minutes, borders on slowness.  A notably faster way to see the 
; image is to go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download the finished image from there.
; 
; A light snow fell overnight Wednesday here at Fractal Central, 
; but the 1/2 inch (1cm) melted away as soon as the sun rose.  
; Unfortunately the grass remained too wet for the sensitive paws 
; of the fractal duo, who once again passed the day on the shelf 
; by the window.  My day was occupied by the Thanksgiving goings 
; on.  The next FOTD will appear as scheduled in 24 hours or so at 
; this same place.  Until then, take care, and when you row your 
; boat, remember that life is but a dream
