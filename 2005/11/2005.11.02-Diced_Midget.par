; FOTD -- November 02, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It looks like a very busy day coming up here at F.C., so today's 
; discussion will be short, to the point, and perhaps a bit too 
; intuitive.
; 
; For today's image I returned to the workhorse MandelbrotMix4 
; formula, which has been almost totally ignored during the past 
; month.
; 
; Exponents of Z between zero and one do not usually make 
; fractals, but when the difference between two exponents in this 
; range is magnified, as it is in today's formula, a fractal 
; surprisingly results.  Today's image is based on the tiny 
; difference between the square root of Z, which is Z^0.5, and 
; Z^0.5001.  It reminds me of diced vegetables, so I named it 
; "Diced Midget".  The wildly clashing colors might work well as 
; party decorations, but they do not make a great fractal. As a 
; result, I could rate today's image no higher than a 5.
; 
; The surprising thing about differences between exponents of Z in 
; the range between 0 and 1 is that, like negative exponents, they 
; produce fractals that are sensitive to changes in the bailout 
; radius.  If the bailout (imag[p3]+100) of today's image is 
; raised, the image soon breaks apart and evaporates.  But unlike 
; the fractals that result from negative exponents, the empty 
; 'inside' area that is left over from images such as today's has 
; little of interest that might be revealed by an inside fill such 
; as 'bof61'.
; 
; Hopefully, the preceding analysis is reasonably correct, with 
; the rush that is expected, I wrote it without checking.  One 
; thing certain however is that the image takes almost 29 minutes 
; to render on my machine.  But this render time may be avoided by 
; downloading the finished image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Another very pleasant day on Tuesday here at Fractal Central 
; left the cats satisfied.  They enjoted themselves in the holly 
; patch until sunset, which is just after 5pm at this time of 
; year.  My day was reasonably satisfactory.  Today is starting 
; sunny and only slightly chilly.  Until the next FOTD, which will 
; appear in 24 hours, take care, and look for light.
