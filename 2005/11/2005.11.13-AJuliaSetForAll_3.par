; FOTD -- November 13, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's fractal we return to the Z^(2.01)+C Mandeloid and 
; check it 300 levels up the logarithmic spiral, where it has 
; rotated nearly 180 degrees, so that East Valley lies on the 
; negative X-axis.  The local elephant herd has has shifted west, 
; perhaps in search of water.
; 
; But once an elephant, always an elephant.  Since elephants can 
; not become seahorses any more than people can become elephants, 
; the basic shape of the Julia set of our western East Valley is 
; still what one would expect of an East Valley Julia set.  This 
; is where the similarity ends however.  The fine-tooth-comb stuff 
; that fills today's Julia set is a horse of a different color.  I 
; have never seen anything like it in any East Valley Julia set of 
; the classic Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The rating of a 6 is a bit above the average, which however is 
; nothing to crow about.  Perhaps if I had monkeyed around with 
; the colors a bit further, I could have rated it at a 7, which 
; would have made me proud as a peacock, but to be honest, the 
; image really is little more than a humdrum Julia set of East 
; Valley.
; 
; The name "A Julia Set for All-3" indicates that it is the third 
; in the series of similar Julia sets.  I doubt that there will be 
; a fourth in the series, and I'm not lion.  I would be bats if I 
; continued this unimpressive series.
; 
; Today's image renders in only 1-3/4 minutes, which is quick as a 
; bunny.  Those with over-progressive machines that have forgotten 
; how to do DOS may see the image by flying like an eagle to the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the finished image from there.
; 
; A totally perfect day here at Fractal Central on Saturday kept 
; the fractal cats quite happy.  Only the brief incursion of an 
; unwelcome stray cat marred their happiness.  But the other cat 
; quickly departed when Tippy approached him and went into fight-
; ing stance.  The day ended with both cats' noses in their tuna 
; dish.  Today is starting perfect again.  My day will not be per-
; fect, as human beings have too many other things to be concerned 
; about, but it looks like it will be pretty good.  Until the next 
; FOTD appears in 24 hours, take care, and will the real mystery 
; please stand up.
