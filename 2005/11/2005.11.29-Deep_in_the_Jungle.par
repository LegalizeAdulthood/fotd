; FOTD -- November 30, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is an evaporated one.  It once was there but now 
; is gone; it leaves its ghost to carry on.
; 
; The original image, which consisted of the usual inside-outside 
; stuff, was created by combining two negative exponents of Z, 
; (-1.5) and (-8.5).  The image was then evaporated by raising the 
; bailout radius to one-googol, which is quite a large number.
; 
; When the original image vanished, nothing was left but a blank 
; screen consisting entirely of 'inside' stuff.  The situation 
; looked hopeless, but hidden in the inside stuff was the ghost of 
; the original image, and it took only the ghost-hunting 'bof61' 
; inside fill to manifest the spirit.
; 
; The resulting image reminds me of a scene in a jungle.  I named 
; it "Deep in the Jungle".  Since I have done several similar 
; images in the past, I could rate it no higher than a 6.  I am a 
; strict rating master.
; 
; The render time of 1-3/4 minutes means that no one will succumb 
; to boredom while waiting for the included parameter file to run. 
; At the same time, those with computers over-qualified for Frac-
; tint can find the finished image posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The rain held off long enough on Tuesday here at Fractal Central 
; for the cats to enjoy the unusually warm temperatures in the mid 
; 60's Fahrenheit (for the backward USA), around 18 Celsius (for 
; the rest of the world).  They lurked in the holly patch several 
; hours, and by the time the rain arrived they were about ready to 
; come inside on their own.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and if you can find a bald eagle, 
; walk with it.  If not, walk with an eagle with feathers.
