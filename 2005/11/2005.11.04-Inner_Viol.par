; FOTD -- November 04, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yesterday's discussion was brief indeed.  But there is no need 
; for alarm.  I am not running out of ideas, nor am I growing 
; bored with fractals.  The unexciting explanation is that there 
; was a power glitch just as I had finished the regular longer 
; discussion.  The glitch caused my tired old computer to recycle 
; before I had a chance to save the discussion that I had just 
; finished.  With a sizable job waiting I had no time to rewrite 
; the FOTD.  As a result I got mad and took about two minutes to 
; gather the parameter info and write a brief discussion outline.
; 
; The main point of the lost discussion led from the magnified 
; difference between very close exponents of Z in the range of 
; 0.6, to the existence of unanswerable questions of life.  Unfor-
; tunately, I do not recall most of what I wrote, but there were 
; no earth-shaking new philosophical insights included.
; 
; As for today's fractal, it is a scene in the western extremity 
; of yesterday's fractal, which is the parent fractal of today's 
; image.  The name "Inner Viol" indicates that yesterday's image 
; is shaped somewhat like an ancient stringed instrument.  The 
; unusually intricate pattern of filaments in today's image raises 
; the rating to a little-above-average 6.  The render time of 
; 7-1/2 minutes means that not too much time will have been wasted 
; if the image proves disappointing.
; 
; And for those whose new-fangled computers are allergic to 
; Fractint, the completed GIF image is available on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Blue skies streaked with angel-hair cirrus and a temperature of 
; 66F 19C made outdoor conditions near perfect here at Fractal 
; Central on Thursday.  The cats approved heartily and spent the 
; afternoon taking it easy in the holly thicket.  Today is 
; starting sunny and even warmer.  The duo will rejoice.  And all 
; fractal fans will rejoice when the next FOTD appears in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and look to the fractal side.
