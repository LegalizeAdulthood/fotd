; FOTD -- November 05, 2004 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; A rather busy day on Friday left little time for fractaling, but 
; I did manage to find one image that I consider worthwhile.  That 
; image appears as today's FOTD.
; 
; To create the image, I returned to the JuliaBC formula.  The 
; Julia set I found is related to the Z^(1.5)+C Mandeloid as it 
; appears 23 levels up the logarithmic spiral.  The 'Seahorse 
; Valley' effect indicates that the Julia set corresponds to a 
; prominent valley area of the Mandeloid.
; 
; I studied the image for several minutes before coming to the 
; conclusion that it is just another Julia set.  I named it "Julia 
; Variation-9" as a continuation of the previous series, and rated 
; it at a 5.  The 1-1/2 minute render time is fast enough that 
; little time will have been wasted if the image disappoints its 
; viewers.  The easiest way of all to view the image is to down-
; load it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where, if all goes well, it will be found posted.
; 
; Well, I have hinted as much in past discussions, but now it is 
; certain.  Within a few months, how many I am not sure, (8 is a 
; good guess), Fractal Central and its associated graphic design 
; business will be moving from Baltimore, its present location, to 
; a new location in central Pennsylvania.  More details will be 
; known as the time grows closer.  Hopefully, the move will be 
; accomplished with as few interruptions in the FOTD as possible.  
; But until we are settled in the new F.C., things will be a bit 
; hectic and the FOTD schedule might become a bit irregular.
; 
; The fractal cats might or might not move with us to the new 
; Fractal Central.  Moving would be hard on them.  They are 15 
; years old and quite settled in their present location.  Since 
; my sister will be moving into the old F.C. when fractal lady 
; and I move out, we very possibly may leave Thomas and Tippy to 
; finish their lives in the only home they have ever known.  But 
; this means we will find two new fractal cats to occupy the new 
; Fractal Central, so stay tuned for further cat developments.
; 
; Partly cloudy skies, gentle winds and a high temperature of 68F 
; 20C here at Fractal Central on Friday proved satisfactory for 
; the fractal cats, who were in the yard from noon until 5pm, 
; doing little but sleeping.  For me things were a little busier 
; than expected, but by the end of the day everything that needed 
; to be done was out of the way.  Today is starting the same, 
; which will likely lead to the same results.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and keep looking up.
