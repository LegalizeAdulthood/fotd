; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The JuliaBC formula, which I recently found in a forgotten file, 
; is proving to be one of the most useful.  Today it takes us 109 
; turns up the logarithmic spiral to examine a Julia set of the 
; Z^1.09+C Mandeloid.
; 
; The unusually small exponent of Z would not be expected to 
; produce much of a fractal.  But in the world of fractals, first 
; impressions are not always accurate.  The resulting image 
; reminds me of a picket fence, so I named it "Picket Fractal".  
; The image consists of about half inside and half outside stuff. 
; The inside parts have been brought to life by the 'bof61' inside 
; fill, making an image that, at least in my opinion, rates a 7.  
; If I had put a bit more effort into the colors, the image might 
; have rated an 8.
; 
; Today's image would appear to have symmetry around the origin.  
; This is one of those wrong first impressions I warned about.  
; Check those colors more carefully.  They most certainly are not 
; symmetrical.  As I said, first impressions of fractals are not 
; always accurate.
; 
; The render time of under 3 minutes is fairly fast, but not as 
; fast as downloading the already rendered image from the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Bright sun was spoiled by a temperature that never rose above 
; freezing here at Fractal Central on Friday.  The cats displayed 
; their displeasure by showing no interest at all in going outside 
; and getting into a spat over something only they knew about.  
; The tuna only half satisfied them.  My day was average, which is 
; not all that bad.  The next in the near-endless series of 
; fractals will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be 
; alert.
