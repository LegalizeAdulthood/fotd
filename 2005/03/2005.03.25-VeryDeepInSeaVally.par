; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have finally become annoyed with the silliness I have been 
; seeing on TV these past few days, and have decided it's time to 
; spout off.  Those who wish to avoid the resulting political 
; blather should skip to the sixth paragraph, where the fractal 
; stuff starts.
; 
; We're all brainwashed.  We're being manipulated by the media, 
; and it has little to do with fractals.  The media decides it's 
; time for us to become excited about the death of the left-over 
; body of a person almost none of us ever knew, whose mind died 
; many years ago.  We, of course, wanting to see ourselves as 
; caring and politically-correct, become obediently excited, right 
; on cue, about the non-event, even to the point of outrage, and 
; begin bleating like the obedient flock of sheep we have become.
; 
; One of the Fractal Central customers, who is an administrator in 
; a local hospital, tells me that such unconscious but semi-awake 
; bodies are released from their vegetative state several times 
; every year at the institution.  And when it happens, it is con-
; sidered barely worth a passing comment among the hospital staff, 
; who consider such animated bodies already dead.  The current fuss 
; is totally a creation of the media and politicians, who are 
; taking advantage of the public ignorance and gullibility. The 
; real questions under discussion should be, 'what is conscious 
; life, when does it start, and when does it end?'
; 
; Such media-induced hysteria has become part of our modern life.  
; It reaches a peak when media coverage causes us to worry about 
; insignificant health threats such as SARS and bird flu, which 
; have killed perhaps a few thousand, and forget the every-day 
; type of influenza, which kills several millions around the 
; world every year.  It's good to be prepared for the worst, but 
; let's get our list of diseases to worry about in proper order.
; 
; At the same time that the media is raising unnecessary alarm 
; about contagious diseases, it is ignoring serious and very real 
; threats to health such as the overuse of cellular telephones, 
; whose radiation again and again has been shown to cause damage 
; to the brains of test animals.  In our ignorance, we routinely 
; use these instruments as we go about our every-day activities, 
; and give them to our children to use as toys and entertainment 
; devices, so they can be like all the other kids at their 
; schools.  Then we complete the plot by placing our cell-phone 
; antennas on the roofs of our schools.
; 
; Every time I hear someone in his ignorance tell me that mobile 
; phones have never been shown to be harmful to humans, someone 
; who cries that they are now a necessary part of the modern life 
; style, I shake my head in sympathy.  This is a person, I think 
; to myself, who has become fully and hopelessly indoctrinated by 
; the media and has joined the vast flock of obedient media-
; controlled sheep.  Cellular phones should be for emergencies; we 
; obedient sheep who watch the phone company ads on TV, have made 
; them a life style.
; 
; END POLITICS=========================================
; 
; I could go on, but this is a fractal forum and we have a fractal 
; of the day to discuss.  I have been having little luck in my 
; exploration of the Elliptic orientation of the Julibrot, so I 
; have decided to take a break of a couple days to give myself 
; more time to find something worthwhile.  In the meantime, there 
; will be no shortage of fractals.
; 
; It is said that the answers to the secrets of the universe lie 
; at the point -0.75 of the Mandelbrot set.  This is the point 
; where the two branches of Seahorse Valley come together.  Even 
; with the fastest super-computers, it would be impossible to see 
; what lies at the point where the two branches actually join, for 
; the point is at a kind of infinitesimal infinity.  But we can 
; come as close to the mystical point as we wish, and see the 
; wonders that lie there.
; 
; Today's scene lies only 0.00009 from the X-axis.  It is as deep 
; as I have yet gone into Seahorse Valley.  It is not the limit, 
; for the valley has no limit, but it is near the limit of what is 
; practical with my current machine.
; 
; At this depth the seahorses have disappeared and been replaced 
; by pinched-off leaves with scalloped edges.  Due to the extreme 
; broadening of the bands that the logmap feature causes in images 
; of high iteration, it has become nearly useless.  Today's image 
; was rendered with a simple straight-forward setting of zero, or 
; one-band-per-iteration.
; 
; I find myself wondering what lies even deeper in the valley.  I 
; will eventually go deeper of course, but I suspect that when I 
; do, I will find nothing other than a more extreme version of 
; today's scene, with features pinched off even tighter.
; 
; I named the image "Very Deep in Seahorse Valley".  The name is 
; nothing more than a description of the location.  I rated the 
; image at a 7, more for the mathematical interest than the 
; artistic merit.
; 
; The iteration count of the large elements in the image is around 
; 300,000 and the maxiter is 25,000,000, which is still insuffic-
; ient to close all the spurious holes.  This makes the image an 
; extremely slow one, which takes over 8 hours to finish on my 
; machine.  But fret not, for I have sent the image on ahead to 
; Paul at the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; from where it may be conveniently downloaded.
; 
; The rain held off here at Fractal Central on Thursday, the 
; clouds actually broke, and the temperature reached 48F 9C.  The 
; cats were quite happy as they enjoyed an unexpected pleasant 
; afternoon in the holly patch.  Only a small treat of tuna was 
; needed to end their day on the up side.  But this morning, the 
; clouds have moved back in, with rain forecast for this after-
; noon.  I'll try to get the duo to take their outdoor time before 
; the rain arrives.
; 
; For me, it will be work before play.  The next FOTD fractal will 
; appear in 24 hours, give or take an hour or two.  Until then, 
; take care, and don't get brainwashed by a fractal.
