; FOTD -- March 19, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I first saw today's moody atmospheric scene, which lies in 
; the Rectangular orientation of the Julibrot, I considered giving 
; it a poetic name such as "Blue Bayou" or "Transfigured Night", 
; or even something bombastic such as "Ripples of Heavenly Peace". 
; But then I turned, glanced out the side window, and saw in the 
; distance the familiar golden arches that mark the location of 
; the local fast-food emporium.  When I turned again to the screen 
; I saw the arches there also.  I immediately got hungry, named 
; the image "Golden Arches", and hurried out to pick up a couple 
; cheeseburgers and a bag of fries.  (Unfortunately for the store, 
; I did not buy a soda, which is where they earn most of their 
; profit.)
; 
; Actually, the image reminds me of the 'lake' transformation, 
; that makes fractals look as though they were half submerged in a 
; lake and being reflected off the rippling surface.  What we are 
; seeing however is a true part of the Z^2+C Julibrot.  The only 
; special effect is that the scene has been stretched in the 
; vertical direction.
; 
; The horizontal stripes are the ever-smaller buds lining the 
; valley leading to the larger period-6 bud on the northeast 
; shoreline of the main bay of the Mandelbrot set.  The golden 
; arch is a different view of the debris that obscures the tiny 
; buds as the imaginary part of initial Z of the Mandelbrot view 
; of the area is changed from zero.
; 
; Today's image is an improvement over yesterday's effort, but its 
; rating of a 7 leaves room for more improvement.  Two Rectangular 
; images remain to be posted.  That gives me two chances to do 
; better.  As in real life, success is never guaranteed, but it 
; will be interesting to see how close I come.
; 
; Today's image is a rather slow one that takes almost 15 minutes 
; to render on my machine.  But relief may be found on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; from where the image may quickly be downloaded.
; 
; The temperature reached a high of 59F 15C here at Fractal 
; Central on Friday.  The wind was light, the sun was bright, and 
; the fractal cats were happy.  They wasted over three hours 
; lurking in the thicket, watching for something that never came.  
; Only a small treat of tuna was needed to end their day happily. 
; Today is starting with some sun, and it is mild again, but rain 
; is due to arrive later this afternoon, hopefully after the duo 
; have finished their outing.
; 
; For me it looks like an average day.  The work is light, so I'll 
; probably spend some time watching the games on TV before 
; entering Fractal Land.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and there's a long time to come before 
; entropy wins.
