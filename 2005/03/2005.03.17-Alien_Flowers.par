; FOTD -- March 17, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Happy Saint Patrick's Day fractal fanatics.
; 
; In yesterday's FOTD discussion I remarked that today's image 
; would be horrendously slow.  I am not quite sure why I made that 
; remark.  Today's image renders in under 50 minutes even on my 
; tired old clunker.  This is not blazingly fast, but it is 
; certainly not horrendously slow either, especially considering 
; that in the past I have posted FOTD images that take over a full 
; day to complete.
; 
; Today's image is one I came upon and passed by while searching 
; for a fractal of the variety seen in yesterday's image.  The 
; scene is located in the vicinity of the large midget on the 
; negative X-axis of the Mandelbrot set.  Since the Julibrot is 
; four-dimensional, it is futile to try to describe the exact 
; relation of today's image to the midget itself, other than to 
; state that, despite its Julia-like appearance, the image is 
; actually sliced in the Rectangular direction.
; 
; The rating of a 7 is based largely on the coloring, to which I 
; gave more than the usual amount of effort.  It is now two days 
; after the time I first saw the image however, and the picture is 
; starting to look more like a 6 than a 7, but I must go with my 
; first impression, so the rating of 7 will remain.
; 
; The image reminds me of a cluster of flowers, such as might be 
; seen on another planet lying in some remote corner of the 
; galaxy.  I named it "Alien Flowers".
; 
; The fractal bouquet may be enjoyed by running the included para-
; meter file and waiting a half-hour or so, or by giving Paul a 
; chance to run the file and post the completed image on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Despair not for the conclusion of the philosophy.  It will 
; eventually appear.  The problem is that I have read some new 
; material that has caused me to rethink several of my long-held 
; conclusions about the nature of the self, and I must now re-
; codify my doctrine.  And yes, I realize that I used the word 
; 'doctrine'.  Since I will be able to offer no proof of my 
; eventual claims, they will fall into the category of a doctrine, 
; to be believed or more likely rejected as the reader sees fit.  
; Hopefully, all this will happen within a week, but no promise 
; is given.
; 
; The afternoon turned cloudy and chilly here at Fractal Central 
; on Wednesday.  The cats turned sulky when the sun vanished, and 
; demanded their tuna before the official time for tuna arrived.  
; But by evening, they had forgotten their bad afternoon and 
; settled for a long sleep.  Today is starting with about the 
; same weather.  I hope the cats' day is better, but fear a 
; repeat.
; 
; With only a little real work to put behind me, I expect my day 
; to be acceptable.  The next FOTD is due in 24 hours.  There is a 
; 99-3/4 percent chance it will appear at that time.  Until that 
; golden moment arrives, take care, and if an atom is a fractal, 
; what then is a molecule of water, which is composed of three 
; fractals?  (Maybe an atom is not a fractal; maybe a molecule of 
; water is a fractal.)
