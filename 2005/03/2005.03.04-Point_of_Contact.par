; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is something entirely different.  It is a slice, 
; cut in a different direction, of the same abstract four-
; dimensional figure that gives us the well-known Mandelbrot set 
; and the infinite variety of Julia sets.  But it resembles 
; neither the Mandelbrot set nor a Julia set.
; 
; The orientation of the slice is very near but not exactly the 
; Oblate direction.  It has in fact been rotated 0.008 degree of 
; arc toward the Julia direction.  When one is exploring the 
; Julibrot, a tiny rotation can sometimes make a big difference.  
; If the 0.008 value of real(p1) is changed as much as one degree, 
; the entire image will collapse into a mere horizontal line.
; 
; The location of the center of the slice is near the tip of the 
; negative stem of the M-set, but removed 1.3 units from the tip, 
; along the real(z) axis.
; 
; The image, which has been stretched horizontally by a factor of 
; almost 1300, features both a hyperbola and a point of contact.  
; Since I have many hyperbolae in my fractal collection, I named 
; the image "Point of Contact".
; 
; For some reason, the idea of today's image seems to exceed the 
; quality of the image itself, and I could give it a rating of 
; only a 4.  But there can be no disappointment, for the render 
; time is so fast that the image will be finished before 
; disappointment can set in.  
; 
; Rendering may be dispensed with entirely by downloading the 
; already-rendered image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a temperature that never rose above freezing and brisk 
; winds from the north, Thursday was an indoor day for the fractal 
; cats, who took their pleasure watching birds from the comfort of 
; their window shelf.  The usual treat of tuna kept them happy.  
; Today is starting sunny and quite cold, but the wind has died 
; and it is due to turn warmer this afternoon.  The fractal cats 
; should be more tolerant of these conditions.
; 
; It looks like an average day coming up for me, which means do 
; what needs to be done, then move on to fractal land.  The next 
; glorious fractal will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and don't get scammed.
