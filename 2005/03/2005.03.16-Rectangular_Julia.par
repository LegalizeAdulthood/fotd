; FOTD -- March 16, 2005 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The figure in today's image does not resemble a midget Mandel-
; brot set.  Nor does it resemble a midget Julia set.  It is some-
; thing entirely different -- a midget Rectangular set -- and it 
; looks like nothing that could appear in the more conventional 
; Mandelbrot or Julia fractals.
; 
; On the surface, today's image suggests a midget Julia set, but 
; Julia midgets are always symmetrical, and the thing in today's 
; image is certainly not symmetrical.  Its left side is entirely 
; different from its right side.  The left side is filled in, 
; while the right side is open.  And what about those brilliant 
; straight elements in the background?
; 
; Such straight elements never appear in Julia or Mandelbrot 
; fractals.  They appear only in certain odd slices between the 
; two orientations.  They are the give-away that we are in an odd 
; orientation of the Julibrot.
; 
; The location of today's scene is the vicinity of the northeast 
; shoreline of the main bay of the large midget on the negative 
; stem of the Mandelbrot set.  It is located on the imag(z) axis, 
; some distance from the actual Mandelbrot set, however.
; 
; Some rotation and stretching was needed to bring the elements of 
; today's scene to a more familiar proportion.  I did no skewing, 
; but the effect of the rotation, combined with the stretching, 
; was to skew, or rather unskew, the image.
; 
; The name "Rectangular Julia" is a simple description.  The 
; rating of a 4 is about what the image deserves.  Such scenes 
; have appeared numerous times in previous FOTD fractals, and the 
; coloring is merely average.
; 
; The render time of around 8 minutes is slightly slow, but com-
; pared to the horrendously slow image that will appear tomorrow, 
; it is as fast as light.  Luckily, relief is, and will be, at 
; hand on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image has been posted, completed and ready for 
; download.
; 
; A sunny but chilly 48F 9C day on Tuesday here at Fractal Central 
; limited the cats' outdoor time to under one hour, but in that 
; time they had enough excitement for an entire day.  While they 
; were resting in the holly thicket, the tough gray-and-white cat 
; from up the hill intruded in the yard, and it took immediate 
; loud action by both Thomas and Tippy to chase him back where he 
; belongs.  When they came inside, I rewarded them with extra tuna 
; and a bit of cheddar cheese.  Today is starting partly cloudy 
; and chilly again.  We could be in for a repeat.
; 
; For me, it looks like just another in an unending string of 
; similar days.  But this does not mean boredom.  How could one be 
; bored in a world composed of the fractals that we call atoms?  
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 or so hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and relax.
