; FOTD -- March 31, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After an image that takes 3 days to finish, one that finishes in 
; under 8 minutes is a pleasure indeed.  Today's rather harmless 
; diversion with the MandelbrotMix4 formula takes us to the 
; fractal that results when portions of Z^(-9.87) and Z^(-0.654) 
; are combined and (1/C) is added.
; 
; The parent fractal is a large non-critical, double-lobed open 
; area with a large off-screen arc of chaos on its west side.  A 
; rather large midget appears in this chaotic area.  Today's scene 
; lies quite deep in the East Valley area of this midget -- not 
; particularly deep into the valley itself, but deep in magnitude.
; 
; I named the image "Dog-Bone".  From a distance, it does rather 
; resemble a bone that might have been chewed on by a dog.  The 
; rating of a 5 is about all I could do for the image, which is 
; almost entirely an intentional artifact of the coloring.
; 
; The 8-minute image will require little computer time to render.  
; Those whose computers are still in the process of rendering 
; yesterday's incredibly slow image will prefer to interrupt that 
; rendering long enough to download the completed GIF file of 
; today's image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A brief comment on the current news appears on the philofractal 
; list version of today's discussion.
; 
; A sunny day Wednesday, with light winds and a temperature of 63F 
; 17C, kept the fractal cats occupied with the outdoor life.  Not 
; much excitement happened however, and they ended the day's ven-
; ture with a treat of tuna.  This morning has brought increasing 
; cloudiness, with rain promised by day's end.  Hopefully the duo 
; will have ended their journey by the time the rain arrives.
; 
; My journey in fractal land will never end however . . .  unless 
; we run out of fractals that is.  Until next FOTD, take care, and 
; life is just a bocci ball.
