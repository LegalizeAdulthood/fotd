; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Did you ever have one of those days when nothing goes right?  
; Well I had one of those days in Fractal Land on Tuesday.
; 
; There I was, in the Elliptic forest, with great fractals all 
; around me.  I heard the muffled growls, I heard the brush 
; rustle.  A twig snapped!  I took off in pursuit!
; 
; The chase was desperately exciting.  I was hot on the spoor of 
; the beast.  I saw the monster in the distance, I zoomed in, I 
; bagged my prey.  But then I looked closer at what I had caught 
; -- today's pathetic Elliptic set, an image that could have been 
; found with much less effort with the every-day Julia formula.
; 
; Actually, the thing on the screen is neither a set nor a midget. 
; It could perhaps be called a basin, or more likely, anything one 
; wishes to call it.  About halfway through the coloring I lost 
; enthusiasm and gave up, leaving the interior of the figure a 
; mish-mash of muddy and conflicting colors.
; 
; The location of the scene is in the vicinity of a midget near 
; the tip of the negative stem of the Mandelbrot set.  Quite a bit 
; of stretching and skewing was needed to bring the image to near 
; proper proportions.
; 
; When I gave up on the image, I named it "Elliptical Thing" 
; without thinking.  I rated the image at a sorry 2, and even that 
; might be a bit generous.  Luckily for all, the image renders in 
; a very fast 1-1/2 minutes, so little time will be spent on a 
; fractal that has so little to offer.
; 
; Perhaps the easiest way to see the image is to download it from 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it waits for all the world to ridicule.
; 
; The sunny afternoon and temperature of 55F 13C here at Fractal 
; Central on Tuesday were fully appreciated by the cats, who spent 
; several hours keeping the yard clear of other cats.  Their day 
; ended with the usual tuna, and they enjoyed a peaceful evening.  
; But this morning is bringing heavy rain, which is due to con-
; tinue most of the day.  What will the duo make of this.
; 
; For me it's a little work and a search for a better fractal.  If 
; I find one, it will appear tomorrow.  If I fail to find one, a 
; worse fractal will appear.  Until then, take care, and I'm not 
; as discouraged as it might appear.
