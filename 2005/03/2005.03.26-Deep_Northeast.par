; FOTD -- March 26, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's listed render time of under 5 minutes is the time it 
; takes for the image to calculate on my fastest machine, a 
; P4-2300, which goes like lightning with the Mandel formula.  On 
; the old warhorse P200, the image takes almost 1 hour to finish.
; 
; The image is another scene very deep in a valley, this time the 
; valley of the period-4 bud on the northeast shoreline of the 
; main bay.  The 'mystic' point of this valley, where the two 
; branches join at infinitesimal infinity, is 0.25,0.5.  This 
; valley, along with its mirror twin at -0.25,0.5, Seahorse Valley 
; at -0.75, and Scepter Valley at -1.25, are the only valleys I 
; know of with rational and therefore easy-to-find 'mystic 
; points'.  The limit of East Valley of the M-set lies at 0.25, 
; and the limit of the East Valley of the largest midget is found 
; at -1.75.  But these 'east' valleys simply come to an end at 
; these points.  They have no opposite branches to join with.
; 
; What we see so deep in today's valley is more of what we saw in 
; Seahorse Valley -- lots of cut-off elements resembling sickle-
; shaped leaves with scalloped edges, and peanut-shaped holes 
; surrounded by vast areas of chaos, which I call 'sand'.  I could 
; have brought some degree of order to these chaotic areas by 
; rendering the image with the logmap in effect, but this would 
; have reduced all but a tiny part of the image to areas of flat 
; color.  The coloring is more intense in today's image, but the 
; image borders on a repeat, and this holds the rating to a 6.
; 
; I named today's image "Deep Northeast".  The name is a simple 
; description of the scene's location.  Depending on the computer, 
; the render time could be anywhere from around 4 minutes to many 
; hours.  Regardless of the machine, the image may be seen nearly 
; instantly by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Light rain in the afternoon and a temperature of only 46F 8C 
; spoiled the cats' day Friday.  They consoled themselves watching 
; the squirrels from their shelf by the window.  Today is starting 
; no better.  I expect the cats' day will be no better either.
; 
; I'll finish the little bit of work, then see what I can find 
; deep in another valley of the M-set.  Hopefully, all the valleys 
; will not be the same.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and speak softly but carry a big fractal.
