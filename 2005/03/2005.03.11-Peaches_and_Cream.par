; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For some reason, I keep winning contests that I have never 
; entered.  Yesterday is a typical example.  While waiting for a 
; tardy customer to call in the final corrections for his job, I 
; heard the phone ring.  When I answered the phone, I heard a very 
; excited voice congratulate me, telling me that I had just been 
; selected to win a brand new Lexus.  Suspecting with good reason 
; that something was not as it seemed, I asked the caller if I had 
; actually already won the Lexus or if the dealer was merely 
; having a sales promotion.  When the caller started talking about 
; the great deals they were offering, I was disappointed but not 
; surprised.
; 
; Today's image is not quite up to yesterday's, and it is 
; certainly not up to a new Lexus, but it is not disappointing and 
; it is actually a bit surprising.  It takes us to the north 
; valley of the Mandelbrot set (I forget the valley's name) and 
; looks at it from the Parabolic direction.
; 
; Once again, the image resembles one of the miniature Julia sets 
; found in the parent Julia sets of the area.  The slices of the 
; Julibrot in the Parabolic orientation are filled with features 
; that resemble Julia sets.  But unlike true Julia sets, where all 
; miniatures in the same set are the same shape, the Julia-like 
; miniatures in Parabolic sets can be of any shape, even in the 
; same parent fractal.  There is an orderly arrangement of the 
; shapes of the miniatures in Parabolic sets, though I have not 
; yet completely figured it out.
; 
; Today's image needed far less un-distorting than yesterday's.  
; It still has been stretched in the vertical direction however, 
; by a magnitude of 2, and skewed by a factor of 9.  Like 
; yesterday's image, today's image turned out to be a perfect 
; Julia-like miniature once the corrections were applied.
; 
; The coloring of today's fractal is not quite up to that of 
; yesterday's image, but it is still unusually smooth for a GIF 
; fractal.  And the incredibly fast render time of 1-1/2 minutes 
; makes the task of rendering the image from the included 
; parameter file a minor event.
; 
; I named today's image "Peaches and Cream".  The peach tint 
; around the edges inspired the name.  Actually, it would be more 
; correct to say that the tint was the cause of the name.  Little 
; inspiration is involved when choose the FOTD names.
; 
; As always, the final product is available for download on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Limited sun, chilly winds, and a temperature of 37F 3C made life 
; unpleasant for the fractal duo on Thursday.  The 20 minutes they 
; spent in the yard were far too little to satisfy their adventur-
; ous spirits.  But a generous serving of tuna and New York white 
; cheddar cheese made their evening acceptable.  Today is starting 
; cloudy, with light snow forecast but not yet in sight.  The cats 
; already look unhappy.
; 
; I expect my day to be uneventful, that is except for the next 
; fractal.  Until 24 hours have passed, and that next fractal 
; appears, take care, and what are dreams made of?
