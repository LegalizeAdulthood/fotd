; FOTD -- March 29, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Deep Scepter".  Since we seem to have 
; developed a fascination with the things deep in Mandelbrot 
; valleys, it appears only proper to investigate the next valley 
; beyond Seahorse Valley -- the one known as Scepter Valley.  
; Today's image takes us to within 0.0004 of the mystic point of 
; this valley, which lies at -1.25 on the X-axis of the M-set.
; 
; If the answers to the secrets of the universe lie at the mystic 
; point of Seahorse Valley, a further clarification of those 
; answers must lie at the mystic point of Scepter Valley.  The 
; answers are still very deeply encoded however, for I see little 
; in today's image other than the expected pinched-off elements, 
; with kingly scepters scattered everywhere.  Unfortunately, the 
; routine nature of the image dampened the effort I put into 
; coloring it.
; 
; I could rate today's image no higher than an average 5.  It has 
; some interesting features, though it is up to the individual to 
; decide whether these are interesting enough to justify the 
; nearly half-hour calculation time.
; 
; Those who decide that the modicum of fractal interest in the 
; image is not worth the rendering effort may still see the image 
; by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; In yesterday's discussion I mentioned a thumbnail image I had 
; done some time back of a scene extremely deep in Seahorse 
; Valley, where arbitrary precision math is required.  I mentioned 
; that the full sized version would require several months to 
; calculate even at SF5 resolution.  Last evening, with nothing 
; else to do, I sat down at my fastest machine to see how deep I 
; could go into Seahorse Valley before the program switched to 
; arbitrary precision math and the calculation time became unrea-
; sonable.  I found a midget on the western shoreline of Seahorse 
; Valley with an imaginary part of under 0.000008, which at the 
; thumbnail size appears to have much of the character of the old, 
; impossibly slow thumbnail image, but does not need the slower 
; math routine, and can therefore render in perhaps 12 hours on 
; the fastest machine.
; 
; Since the fastest machine is usually busy on some more immediate 
; task, and slows to a crawl on fractals if it is left alone and 
; not kicked into high gear every half hour or so, it will take a 
; few days to finish the full-sized image.  But I hope that when 
; the image is finished, we will see Seahorse Valley as we have 
; never seen it before.
; 
; Heavy rain and occasional rumbles of thunder kept the fractal 
; cats safely indoors all day Monday here at Fractal Central.  The 
; temperature of 52F 11C was mild enough, but the duo never got 
; outside to check it.  Needless to say, an extra treat of tuna 
; was needed in the evening to assure their moods remained bear-
; able.  Today is starting dry and mild, but it is cloudy and the 
; wind is up.  It remains to be seen how the duo will handle these 
; conditions.
; 
; For me, the disposition of the day has yet to be determined, but 
; the disposition of the next fractal is near certain -- it will 
; appear right here in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be 
; aware of the fractals lurking around you.
