; FOTD -- March 12, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is titled "Warp-10".  In the world of Star Trek, 
; warp-10 equals infinite velocity, the velocity of a hypothetical 
; tachyon that has totally exhausted its energy.  But in the 
; equally fantastic world of fractals, warp-10 describes an image 
; of a Mandelbrot midget that looks as though it is moving at a 
; very high velocity.  The velocity is not infinite, but the mid-
; get is moving faster than the velocity of light in the medium, 
; presumably a gas, through which it is moving, and is emitting 
; Cherenkov radiation as it plows along.
; 
; The scene, which is sliced in the Parabolic direction, shows a 
; sub-midget located deep in East Valley of the large midget on 
; the negative X-axis of the Mandelbrot set.  Its appearance shows 
; why I named this particular orientation the Parabolic.
; 
; The rating of a 6 might be a bit conservative.  Having been here 
; often before, I found the scene almost automatically, and had no 
; surprise when I saw the final result.  A good part of the rating 
; of the FOTD images comes from the satisfaction I get from seeing 
; something new.  If I had never before seen an image like 
; today's, I would have rated it around a 7.  But as it is, the 
; rating of 6 will have to do.
; 
; The render time of 46 seconds is less than it will take to visit 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download the completed GIF image from there.  But for those 
; with handicapped computers unable to run Fractint parameter 
; files, it might be the only way of viewing the image.
; 
; With some sun and a high temperature of 52F 11C, Friday was 
; pleasant enough to merit the approval of the dynamic duo.  In 
; the evening a light thunder-shower moved over, but by then the 
; duo had finished their outdoor exploration and were enjoying 
; their tuna.  Today is starting sunny and only slightly colder.  
; The duo should grant their approval.  For me it looks like an 
; average day coming up.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and be of fractal heart.
