; FOTD -- August 25, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's rather soothing blue-and-lavender image resulted when I 
; combined negative Z^(-0.5) and negative Z^(-5.5), then added 
; (1/C).  The parent fractal consists of a large sprawling, 
; shapeless, apparently non-critical ocean, filled with countless 
; islands, surrounded by a large disturbed area of tiny lakes and 
; interconnected rivers.  Some distance to the west lies a small 
; but obvious, distorted Mandeloid, which most definitely is 
; critical.  Today's scene is located on a filament rather deep in 
; the east valley of this Mandeloid.
; 
; The image was generated with the MandelbrotMix4 formula, which 
; is not perfect.  It does not find all the critical points of the 
; entered expressions, which I suspect have many critical points, 
; but it usually finds one critical point, which is enough to 
; reveal some intact midgets.  Actually, for me, finding these 
; critical areas is much of the fun of working with this formula.
; 
; I named the image "A Nice One".  The word 'nice' is what a 
; person uses when they want to please someone but have little 
; appreciation of the thing about which they are commenting.  The 
; word 'one' can refer to almost anything.  In this case it can 
; refer to anything about the image that the viewer desires -- the 
; generating formula, the color palette, the picture as a whole, 
; the midget itself, or the intricate pattern around the midget.  
; For me, the word relates to the whole image.
; 
; I rated the image at a 7 because of the coloring, which to me 
; makes the fractal appear unusually soothing.  (Since when have 
; fractals been soothing?)  With a lesser color palette, the image 
; would rate no higher than a 5.
; 
; The render time of just under 11 minutes is true on my 10-year-
; old P200 machine, which, with its 16mb of memory, is good for 
; little other than old DOS programs such as ChessMaster-2001, 
; WordPerfect-5.1 and Fractint.  On any machine made in the 21st 
; Century, today's image will render in under 5 minutes.
; 
; But some present day machines are over-qualified.  They have 
; forgotten how to handle DOS programs and balk when the user 
; attempts to boot Fractint.  But these machines are very capable 
; of surfing the web, and can easily access today's image, which 
; is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; ready to be downloaded.
; 
; Today's cat report is non-eventful.  The weather remained near 
; perfect here at Fractal Central on Wednesday, as did the fractal 
; cats.  A perfectly uneventful day might be boring to read about, 
; but it is a pleasure to experience.  Today is starting the same. 
; Things again look good for the fractal cats.  For me, there's 
; the usual work to do and fractals to find.  The next fractal 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and speak with 
; your fractals, but don't get caught doing it.
