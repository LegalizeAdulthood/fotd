; FOTD -- August 07, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is totally out of control.  At first glance it 
; appears to have l-r symmetry, but this is only an illusion.  It 
; doesn't even have symmetry.  There is absolutely no single theme 
; that characterizes the image other than total random chaos.
; 
; The formula behind the madness is named 'Mystic2'.  I wrote it a 
; number of years ago then promptly forgot it because it draws 
; nothing but empty circles of radius 1.  But one day I applied an 
; active inside fill to one of the empty circles and discovered a 
; whole new fractal world hidden in the emptiness.
; 
; Unfortunately, there appears to be no recognizable system behind 
; the fractals the formula draws.  The outcome is always a sur-
; prise.  This is good enough when one is seeking surprises, but 
; it makes the orderly fractal searches, such as I enjoy, nearly 
; impossible.  Considering all this, I could rate the image no 
; higher than an average 5.
; 
; Today's image, which is all inside stuff, was rendered with the 
; inside set to 'bof61'.  The 'zmag' option works almost as well.  
; I have not tried the other options, but I suspect they will give 
; similar results.
; 
; I named the image "Quasi-Sun".  The brilliant white ball at top 
; center rather resembles a blazing sun, and a closer examination 
; will reveal spots on the surface of the sun -- sunspots no 
; doubt.  But it's only a fractal, and fractals do not support 
; nuclear fusion, so it is only an imaginary sun.
; 
; The render time of 4-1/2 minutes is fast enough for most pur-
; poses, whatever those purposes might be in addition to just 
; plain enjoyment.  An even faster way of viewing the disorganized 
; image is to download it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; An acceptably mild and dry day on Saturday was just what the 
; fractal cats needed to help them get over their recent bad 
; moods.  With a high temperature of 86F 30C making the outdoors 
; comfortable, the cats were able to spend over 6 hours lurking in 
; the depths of the holly patch.  I have no idea why they must 
; lurk.  They never pounce on prey.  This morning is starting 
; cloudy and not too warm, but the humidity is higher and I hear 
; distant thunder.  I suppose the cats will make the best of 
; things.  For me the work is falling behind again, as it occasion-
; ally does.  I'll try to have the next FOTD ready in 24 hours.  
; If not, it will appear a day or so later.  Until next time, take 
; care, and sometimes chaos is good for you.
