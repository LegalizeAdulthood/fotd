; FOTD -- August 09, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is part of the fractal that results when 11 parts 
; of Z^(-11) are combined with (1/Z), and (1/C) is added.  The 
; parent fractal consists of a large shapeless central ocean 
; surrounded by spreading filaments.  An uncountable infinity of 
; midgets lies on these filaments.  (Or is it a countable infi-
; nity?  Not all infinities are the same.  Given an eternity of 
; time, some infinities could be counted; other infinities could 
; not be counted even with an infinity of eternities in which to 
; do the counting.)  Regardless of the transfinite number of the 
; midgets in today's parent fractal, today's scene lies in the 
; East Valley area of the largest midget.
; 
; The image has been rendered with the outside set to 'tdis', 
; which colors the pixels according to how far they travel before 
; escaping.  Something about the coloring puts me in the mood for 
; a huge slice of strawberry shortcake, which is why I named the 
; image "Strawberry Shortcake".  The rating of a 7 is the best of 
; the past several days, and is actually surprising, considering 
; how little spare time I had available to find today's fractal 
; and color it.
; 
; An above-average image that renders in 6-1/2 minutes is a joy to 
; behold.  Since this accurately describes today's image, today's 
; image must be a joy to behold.  Of course, the rendering task 
; may be bypassed entirely by going to the popular FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the already-rendered image from there.
; 
; Rain was forecast for Monday and rain arrived.  Over 3 inches 
; (8cm) fell, keeping the fractal cats confined indoors for the 
; entire day, dashing in and out of hiding whenever they heard 
; thunder.  Needless to say, they were quite grouchy and needed 
; generous tuna to make them bearable.  (We also had a local 
; transit bus caught in a flash flood, with 18 people needing 
; rescue by boat.  They were grouchy also.)  Today is starting 
; cloudy with more heavy rain threatening.  I doubt that the day 
; will be much if any better.
; 
; For me, the work continues to pile up.  It looks like that FOTD 
; hiatus is not far off.  Hopefully, it will not start tomorrow, 
; when the next FOTD is due.  Until that next FOTD appears, take 
; care, and make the most of the least.
