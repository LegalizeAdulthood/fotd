; FOTD -- August 02, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "On The Way" because it is a passing scene 
; viewed on the way to the final goal, which is an as-yet unseen 
; midget lying at the center.  I will reach this final goal later 
; today, and it will appear tomorrow as the midget at the center 
; of the frame.
; 
; Today's scene is located in the Mandelbrot set, on the eastern 
; shoreline of the main bay of a midget near the tip of the 
; negative stem.  Since I have not yet seen the final product, I 
; can not yet give today's image an honest rating.  The rating of 
; a 5 is simply the average default rating.
; 
; Being well within the range of arbitrary math, the image takes 
; over 18 minutes to render.  Whether the result is worth the 
; effort will not be known until the image is seen.  Of course, 
; all uncertainty can be eliminated by downloading the finished 
; fractal from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Fans of philosophy must have long ago given up hope that I would 
; ever resume my discussion of the great philosophical problems 
; about the nature of the 'self'.  I have not abandoned the line 
; of thought; the difficulty lies in trying to fit my conclusions 
; into the rational scientific framework.  Our method of doing 
; science is totally geared to an assumed objective reality, and 
; is truly unable to work with subjective things such as the con-
; scious mind unless it reduces them to the activity of the objec-
; tive mass of meat we call the brain, a reduction that totally 
; loses the subjective aspect.  The problem is one of describing 
; subjective reality in a system that considers the term self-
; contradictory.  I have many things to say on this topic, which, 
; for fear of offending those with other views, I have not yet 
; decided to put into words and make public.
; 
; With a high temperature of 86F 30C and rather high humidity, 
; Monday was a bit too warm for the fractal cats.  They still 
; managed almost two hours stretched on the cool ground under the 
; holly trees however.  Today is starting warmer and more humid.  
; It will probably be too hot for the duo.  For me, it looks like 
; a dull average day coming up.  The next FOTD fractal will appear 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and a dispassionate skeptic 
; is about as rare as a dispassionate religious fundamentalist.
