; FOTD -- August 11, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; If you have a feeling of deja-vu while looking at today's image, 
; it is not a sign that you lived a previous life on earth.  It is 
; because today's image is a repeat of yesterday's image, with 
; only a few changes added.  Those changes are in the magnitude, 
; escape radius, and inside fill.
; 
; To start, I slightly decreased the magnitude of yesterday's 
; image to include a bit more of the surrounding features.  Then I 
; increased the escape radius from 100 to 1100, a change that 
; partly evaporated the image.  Finally, I rendered the increased 
; 'inside' area with the 'bof61' option to add extra life.  The 
; result is today's image, which I have named "Venetian Opened", 
; assuming that someone has opened yesterday's blinds.
; 
; The final image is not quite up to yesterday's, so I could rate 
; it no higher than a 7, but it is still worth a look, and with a 
; render time of almost exactly 9 minutes, it is, at least in my 
; opinion, worth the effort.  Those whose opinions differ may 
; avoid the task of rendering by downloading the pre-rendered GIF 
; image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Partly cloudy skies, bearable humidity, and a high temperature 
; of 86F 30C made outdoor conditions near ideal for the fractal 
; cats on Wednesday.  In fact, the conditions were a bit too 
; ideal.  Tippy refused to come in when evening arrived, and had 
; to be carried inside bodily, grumbling to himself all the way.  
; Today is starting much the same.  It looks like another good day 
; for the duo.  For me, the work is continuing to back up.  A FOTD 
; hiatus will likely be necessary within a day or two, but for 
; now, it looks like the next FOTD will appear on schedule in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and when we discover what we are, 
; will we need to ask why we are?
; 
; Or are we ourselves, with our insatiable curiosity, merely 
; inventing all these apparent mysteries? . . .
