; FOTD -- August 30, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The following paragraph is off-topic.  Those who disdain OT 
; stuff should skip to the next paragraph.
; 
; Today started out great.  When I opened my e-mailbox, I found 
; that I have won not one but three lotteries that I have never 
; entered.  And there's a man in Nigeria who wants to give me 
; 14-million dollars to invest for him in the U.S.  I also 
; discovered that my ebay account (I have no ebay account) has 
; been suspended due to fradulent activity and that the Mindspring 
; team (which no longer exists) needs me to confirm my billing 
; information.  ;-)  A whole new industry is developing out there. 
; It's called phishing, and there's still time to get in on the 
; ground floor.  ;-)  Yes, I realize that we all get this kind of 
; stuff, but now and then I like to have a little fun with it.
; 
; Yesterday's 'Aching Tooth' image, which was created with the 
; ParabolicMix3 formula, was not overwhelming, but the image was 
; merely a side event.  The main purpose of the ParabolicMix3 
; formula is to find critical points of the expressions entered 
; into it.  The formula did its job well, and determined that 
; 0.6447424469 is one of the critical points of the expression 
; 0.5*Z^(1.5)+0.5*Z^(-1.5)+0.5*Z^(2)+Z.  I entered this expression 
; as the parameters and the determined value as the starting 
; point of Z in the MandelbrotMix3 formula to produce today's 
; curious Mandelbrot set.
; 
; Today's image is the entire fractal -- the parent fractal 
; itself.  The image was rendered with the outside set to the 
; usual 'iter', producing equal-iteration bands.  These bands are 
; the same coloring method that was used in the fractal program 
; that I used to create my first fractal nearly 20 years ago.  The 
; 'surface of a boiling liquid' effect is totally due to the 
; generating expression.
; 
; The Mandeloid is distorted by too small a period-2 bud and by 
; having the other buds drawn toward the main bud.  (This always 
; happens when the main bud is smaller.)  But the inner details 
; are the same as in the classic Z^2+C M-set, with the bubbling 
; iteration bands persisting all the way down.  (At least it's not 
; turtles.  :-)  )
; 
; I named today's fractal "Aching Mandeloid" because it is a part 
; of the same Julibrot that held yesterday's 'Aching Tooth' image. 
; The image is a slight improvement over yesterday's, which earns 
; it a rating of an average 5 -- hardly earth-shattering but worth 
; a peek.  And the very fast render time of 13 seconds makes 
; taking that peek an easy task.
; 
; As always, those with handicapped or over-qualified machines may 
; download the finished GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a high temperature of 86F, 30C, Monday was a bit too warm 
; and humid for absolute perfection, but the fractal cats are 
; stubborn, and despite the less-than-ideal conditions, they spent 
; several hours in the yard.  At one point I heard Tippy shout at 
; something, but no disturbance was in sight.  He was probably 
; just quarreling with Thomas, as they sometimes do.  The evening 
; went smoothly, and they settled down without incident.  My day 
; was uneventful.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy and damp, and with showers forecast, 
; things do not look great for the duo.  For me however, it looks 
; like just another normal day coming up.  The next FOTD will be 
; coming up in 24 hours.  The next burst of eye-opening and hard-
; hitting philosophy will also be coming up before long.  Until 24 
; hours from now, take care, and as you become aware of the many 
; fractals around you, stop to wonder where they come from.
