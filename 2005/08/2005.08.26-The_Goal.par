; FOTD -- August 26, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we have a fractal, which, like life itself, has a goal.  
; The goal of life is sometimes said to be merely getting through 
; the trials of life.  If this is so, it is not much of a goal.  
; I doubt that anyone has ever failed or ever will fail to get 
; through life.  Sometimes it is said that life is a school in 
; which we learn life's lessons.  If so, it is a puzzling school.  
; A school teaches lessons that will be of practical use in the 
; business world after graduation.  Unless I have totally missed 
; it, there is no apparent business world waiting where we will 
; have the opportunity to put our hard-learned lessons to use once 
; we graduate from life.  What then is the purpose of the lessons 
; we learn?  It is another topic for a future burst of philosophy.
; 
; Well, I had best cut it short.  I started to talk about fractals 
; but drifted into philosophy and religion.  That's how it is with 
; these mysterious things we call fractals.  One sees a design and 
; starts thinking deep and not always optimistic thoughts about 
; other things.  I am not yet thinking deeply enough to say that 
; fractals might be alive, but since the limits of life are un-
; known, who knows what I might say tomorrow.
; 
; One thing for certain is that today's image results from a combi-
; nation of Z^(3) and Z^(-2.5), with (1/C) added.  The parent 
; fractal consists of a large central Mandeloid surrounded by a 
; huge near-circular area of semi-chaos.  Today's image is located 
; very close to the northern edge of this chaotic area.
; 
; I named the image "The Goal", assuming that the eight shafts 
; point to the almost invisible midget at the center as their 
; goal.  To achieve the mild 3-D effect, I rendered the image with 
; the outside set to 'tdis'.  The inside was set to the color in 
; register 255 because the 'passes=b' option does not work when 
; the inside is set to my usual setting of '0.'  I used 'passes=b' 
; because it is actually the fastest with this particular image, 
; and it is always the most fun to watch in action.  (It is also 
; the most likely to miss large portions of images, which is why I 
; do not use it more often.)
; 
; The image is at least slightly above average, and rates a modest 
; 6.  Its modest render time of 2 minutes will use up only a small 
; amount of computer time.  And as always, the already-rendered 
; image is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The near-perfect weather continued through Thursday here at 
; Fractal Central, and the fractal-central cats totally enjoyed 
; it.  They were outside from 10am until dusk -- about 9 hours.  
; Rarely have I seen them so content.  No tuna at all was needed 
; in the evening.  Today is starting much the same.  I expect that 
; another great day is coming up for the cats.  For me it looks to 
; be another in a near endless string of days filled with both 
; work and relaxation, but then that's what life is all about.  
; The next fractal, glorious or not, will appear in this same 
; place at around 1430 hours GMT on Saturday August 27.  Until 
; then, take care, and when will A.I. computers get smart enough 
; to reveal the answers to life's great mysteries?
