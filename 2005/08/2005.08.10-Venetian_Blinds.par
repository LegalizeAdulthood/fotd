; FOTD -- August 10, 2005 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I see on the news that someone has just cloned a dog.  It's not 
; much of a surprise, since they have already cloned mice, sheep, 
; horses, cats, etc.  But it does raise a theological question.  
; Is the fact that men have created living animals evidence that 
; God is unnecessary for the emergence of life, or is it evidence 
; that life can arise only through the working of a higher intelli-
; gence?  This question is one that I will discuss in detail when 
; (if ever) the next outburst of philosophy happens.
; 
; For now, we have a fractal to discuss, and a rather good one at 
; that.  The parent fractal came about when I combined a negative 
; portion of Z^(-1.1) with 5 negative portions of Z^(-11), then 
; added (1/C) to create one of those rambling, indescribable 
; fractals, boring on the surface but filled with deep mysteries.
; 
; Today's parent fractal is dominated by one huge open ocean.  The 
; scene of the image is located on the northern shoreline of this 
; ocean, deep in a rather strange inverted 'V' shaped valley.  I 
; rendered it with the outside set to 'tdis', resulting in the 
; venetian blind effect that inspired the name "Venetian Blinds".
; 
; I rated the image at an 8.  It is quite unlike a typical image 
; of a typical midget, and this uniqueness gives it its value.  
; The render time of 6 minutes is slightly slow, but this time is 
; on my 10-year-old machine.  On most modern machines the render 
; time will be cut to around 2 minutes.
; 
; This render time can be forgotten entirely by going to the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the already-rendered GIF image from there.
; 
; The clouds hung heavy on Tuesday here at Fractal Central, but no 
; rain fell from them and the temperature stopped rising at 77F 
; 25C.  These conditions proved unexpectedly satisfactory for the 
; cats, who spent over five hours in the holly thicket.  Only a 
; little tuna was needed to end their day happily.  Today is start-
; ing partly cloudy with rain again forecast, but something tells 
; me that the experts are wrong with their rain forecast, and the 
; cats will be happy. I'll be happy when I get the work caught up, 
; a condition that is not yet showing signs of coming about.  
; Unless something goes wrong, the next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and does ultimate truth always 
; need to make sense?
