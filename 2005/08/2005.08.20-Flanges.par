; FOTD -- August 20, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I opened my e-mailbox this morning, I found 11 meaningless 
; letters with 11 copies of the same 79k-byte 'zip' file attached. 
; (One 'zip' file attached to each letter!)  It must be some new 
; virus that has just started circulating.  We'll see how fast the 
; Earthlink virus filter, which is pretty efficient, starts recog-
; nizing and deleting it.
; 
; No deep meaning lies hidden in today's image.  It is simply one 
; of the infinite things that numbers do when reiterated.  The 
; generating formula is a play on the negative square root of 2, 
; which creates another of those parent fractals that defy exact 
; description.
; 
; Basically, the parent fractal is a Mandeloid with X-axis 
; symmetry, orientated with the main stem facing east.  The large 
; main bay contains two crescent shaped islands, and a circular 
; ring lies at the tip of the main stem.  Today's scene is located 
; on the north shoreline of the large bay.
; 
; To add a bit of interest, I rendered the scene with the outside 
; set to 'real', which colors the pixels according to the value of 
; the real part of the point of escape.  The effect is one we have 
; seen several times in recent FOTD's, which is why I rated the 
; image at an altogether average 5.
; 
; The name "Flanges" came to mind for some reason as I was contem-
; plating the image in search of a suitable name.  Looking at the 
; image today, I see no justification for such a name.  A flange 
; is part of a railway wheel, and today's image lies nowhere near 
; the fractal railyard.
; 
; The render time of 13 minutes is a bit slow for a merely average 
; image.  But much time may be saved by visiting the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the finished GIF image from there.
; 
; Occasional rain fell through the morning and into the early 
; afternoon Friday here at Fractal Central.  The temperature of 
; 75F 24C was quite comfortable, but the fractal cats would rather 
; have been outside.  They turned grumpy early and stayed grumpy 
; all day.  An extra large treat of tuna in the evening brought 
; them back to a bearable mood.  Today is starting cloudy and very 
; muggy.  It might turn out too warm for the aging duo.  We'll see 
; how the day goes.
; 
; For me the day will be busy but under control.  And the next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and don't 
; be one of them.
