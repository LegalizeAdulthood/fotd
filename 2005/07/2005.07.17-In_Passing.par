; FOTD -- July 17, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With lightning striking in the area almost all day Saturday, I 
; kept the computers unplugged.  This left little time for fractal 
; exploration.  Luckily, things settled down around midnight, and 
; I barely managed to find a fractal.  I did not actually search 
; for today's image; I merely happened upon it in passing through 
; in search of larger game.  This is why I named the serendipitous 
; image "In Passing".
; 
; The parent fractal was created by combining 2 parts of Z^(-0.1) 
; with 0.1 part of Z^3 and adding (1/C).  The resulting fractal is 
; shaped much like a figure eight.  Today's scene is located in 
; the eastern valley of the 'eight'.
; 
; Actually, with its rating of 5, the image is better than it has 
; any right to be.  The totally random color palette works unexpec-
; tedly well in bringing out the twisted, tortured effect of the 
; fractal elements.  And to top things off, the render time is a 
; satisfyingly short 5-1/2 minutes.
; 
; Those with internet access, (and who is not in that group), may 
; save a bit more time by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the finished GIF image from there.
; 
; One rain-and-lightning storm after another moved through the 
; Fractal Central area on Saturday.  The explosive thunder kept 
; the fractal cats well out of sight, hidden in the deepest 
; recesses of the large closet.  They did not emerge until just 
; after midnight when the noise finally abated.  Surprisingly, the 
; fractal basement remained dry even though over 4 inches 10cm of 
; rain fell during the day.  It's too bad that the local electric 
; companyette could not keep the electricity flowing.  Today is 
; starting extremely warm and humid, but so far it is dry.  The 
; cats are still skittish.  We'll see how it goes.
; 
; Unless something unexpected happens, the next FOTD will appear 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and keep your powder dry.
