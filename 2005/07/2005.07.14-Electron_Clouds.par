; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For the past two days I have said that the "Hanging Garden" 
; image of July 12 contains midgets.  Today's image proves it.  
; Today's "Electron Clouds" scene exists in the "Hanging Garden" 
; image of two days ago, where it was hiding itself among the 
; garland of flowers spanning the sky.
; 
; Today's image consists mostly of inside stuff.  To make this 
; stuff visible I have rendered the image with the inside set to 
; 'zmag', one of the slower inside options, which I rarely use, 
; but which, in today's fractal, works better than any other 
; inside option.
; 
; The name "Electron Clouds" is a reference to my wonder years, 
; when I was just discovering science and the nature of the world 
; in which we live.  (That sense of wonder is now shared by the 
; world of fractals.)  Back then, I visualized an atom as a kind 
; of miniature solar system, with a central nucleus like a boiling 
; raspberry and tiny material electrons circling the nucleus like 
; shiny silver planets.
; 
; When I asked my high school physics teacher what those electrons 
; are made of, and what they actually look like, he replied that I 
; was a philosopher, and told me that I would be a good physicist. 
; At the time, this puzzled me.  I thought that physics was about 
; as far from philosophy as it is possible to get.
; 
; I have since learned that he was not as wrong as I had supposed. 
; Electrons, as well as all the other atomic and sub-atomic 
; things, are too small to reflect light, and therefore do not 
; possess the attribute we call appearance.  Asking how they look 
; is meaningless.  An atom that resembles a miniature solar system 
; is only a mental model, a philosophical idea which makes it 
; easier for us to think about atoms.  The real question is what, 
; if anything, is really down there, serving as the building 
; blocks of physical matter.  (Or could it all be an illusion, and 
; if so, what is having the illusion?)
; 
; Well, I see myself drifting from the topic of fractals, into the 
; field of philosophy, about which I will have much to say in the 
; near future.  But for now, it's time to get back to the fractal 
; basics.
; 
; In my opinion, today's image is worth the 7 I have given it, 
; even though I had to hurry a bit when coloring it.  The render 
; time of 35 minutes is slow, but the medicine for impatience is 
; available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; from where the completed GIF image can be downloaded.
; 
; The air was sopping wet with humidity here at Fractal Central on 
; Wednesday, while the temperature reached a high of 88F 31C even 
; with the heavy clouds.  But luckily for the duo, no rain fell, 
; permitting them a full afternoon and evening in the holly patch. 
; At nightfall they came inside without coaxing to enjoy their 
; evening treat of tuna.  Today is starting in a similar manner, 
; so, unless it rains, I expect similar things from the cats.  The 
; next fractal will appear by near-magic 24 hours from now.  Until 
; then, take care, and what is an electron cloud made of?
