; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The lacy effect of today's image inspired the name "Old Lace", 
; though in this case no arsenic is involved.  What is involved is 
; a combination of negative Z and (1/Z), with C added.
; 
; It is curious that this combination would produce any fractal at 
; all.  By itself, negative Z does not make a fractal, and (1/Z) 
; makes a simple vertical row of small flat disks.  (In the odd 
; orientations of the Julibrot, (1/Z) produces some striking 
; effects, but this is another story.)  When negative Z and (1/Z) 
; are combined however, some very interesting Mandelbrot things 
; can happen.
; 
; In today's image, I added (1/Z) to negative Z.  The resulting 
; parent fractal is a rough hyperbola with Mandelbrot buds along 
; its edges, and a small valley at the apex.  Today's scene lies 
; in the vicinity of this valley.
; 
; I rated the image at a 7.  The coloring, which is about as 
; smooth as can be achieved with only 256 colors to work with, 
; adds to the impact, and raises the rating from a 6 to the 7.  
; The render time of 26 minutes is admittedly slow.  But relief 
; may be found on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the completed image is posted, ready for download.
; 
; The clouds remained thick all day Thursday here at Fractal 
; Central, while the temperature reached a high of 81F 27C.  
; Luckily, the rain held off until after dark, which gave the cats 
; a pleasant afternoon in the yard.  They became alert when two 
; unwanted neighborhood stray cats wandered by, but the other cats 
; moved on without coming within confrontation range.  Today is 
; starting with heavy rain however.  Unless it ends in a hurry, 
; the cats' day will be spoiled.  My day will consist of the usual 
; work and fractals, the next of which will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and where do fractals come from?
