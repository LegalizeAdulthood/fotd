; FOTD -- July 31, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's little fractal diversion takes us to the western (child) 
; shoreline of the northern branch of Seahorse Valley of the 
; Mandelbrot set, where we dig deep into a bit of a seahorse tail 
; to find a midget.  Not satisfied with the midget, we dig into a 
; seahorse-type arm extending from the midget's northern side 
; until we find an even smaller midget.  This smaller midget is 
; what appears at the center of today's image.
; 
; I have named the image "Fractal Tiles".  The pattern around the 
; midget does rather resemble a pattern of tiles.  The rating of 7 
; seems appropriate for a scene lying in such an obvious location.
; 
; The color palette is a random one created by striking the 
; 'enter' key while in color-cycling mode.  It is probably not the 
; best of all possible colorings, but it is good enough to rate 
; the 7.
; 
; The magnitude is great enough to require arbitrary precision 
; math, which slows the image to a render time of 57 minutes, but 
; relief is at hand in the form of the completed image, which soon 
; is posted to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The temperature of 82F 28C was just what the fractal cats wanted 
; on Saturday.  They lounged in the yard for almost eight hours 
; before finally deciding to come inside for their tuna.  Today is 
; starting much the same.  It looks good for the cats.
; 
; For me the coming day looks uneventful, so until next month, 
; when the next FOTD will appear, take care, and remember that 
; patience is rewarded, but never try to spend your reward.
