; FOTD -- July 18, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's fractal I changed the Z^2 of yesterday's image to 
; Z^2.5, resulting in a larger parent figure-eight fractal, with 
; a more complex valley on the east side.  This east-valley area 
; holds much of interest.  Unable to examine everything, I chose 
; a curious bud shaped like a midget.  The filaments of this 
; bud-midget have curious holes scattered along them.  Today's 
; scene is located on the shoreline of one of these holes.
; 
; I named the image "It Laid an Egg".  The name has nothing to do 
; with the quality of the image.  It refers to the egg-shaped area 
; surrounding the central midget, and the questionable things 
; going on within.
; 
; The expected 2,4,8... series of elements seems to be there, but 
; the expected near-perfect symmetry has taken kind of a beating.  
; These not-quite-right areas of fractals often hold the most 
; interesting and unexpected images.  Today's image rates a 6, one 
; point of which is due to its symmetry problems.
; 
; The render time of 28 minutes is a bit slow, but may be avoided 
; by downloading the finished image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; We had heat and humidity aplenty here at Fractal Central on 
; Sunday.  The temperature rose to 90F 32C, but there was no sign 
; of the torrential rain and lightning storms that plagued the 
; area yesterday.  Thanks to the more settled weather, the fractal 
; cats had an entire afternoon of relaxation in the holly patch.  
; Today is starting hot and just a slight bit less humid.  If no 
; storms come up, the cats should have another acceptable day.  
; For me it's work and fractals.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and beware of the pods.
