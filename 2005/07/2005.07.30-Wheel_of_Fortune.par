; FOTD -- July 30, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us very deep into the Mandelbrot set, where 
; we investigate a scene near the tip of the long northern 
; filament extending from the large midget on the negative X-axis. 
; The scene is actually located on a tiny hair-like sub-filament 
; extending from a very small midget on the long filament itself.
; 
; I named the image "Wheel of Fortune" because it consists of 
; little more than an intricate series of concentric circles.  In 
; fact, most all very deep midgets consist of little more than 
; concentric circles, which is why I could rate today's image no 
; higher than a 6.
; 
; As a matter of curiosity, at the magnitude of today's image, 
; the entire Mandelbrot set would be about 10,000,000,000,000,000 
; times the size of the solar system, which would make it some-
; where in the size range of the observable universe.  Much unex-
; plored territory indeed still lies hidden within the Mandelbrot 
; set, waiting patiently to be discovered, but, considering the 
; size of the unexplored area, I fear most of it is due for a long 
; wait.
; 
; In my opinion, the render time of 27 minutes is reasonable for 
; an image of such high magnitude.  Those who do not share my 
; opinion may download the finished GIF image from the FOTD web 
; site at:

; 
; The heavy clouds hung tough here at Fractal Central on Friday, 
; but the rain held off, and the temperature reached only 77F 25C, 
; this permitted the dynamic duo a pleasant afternoon in the yard. 
; It was so pleasant in fact that they almost forgot their evening 
; tuna.  Today is starting with clouds and a continuing but lesser 
; threat of rain.  Maybe the cats good luck will continue.  For me 
; it's the usual round of work before fractal fun.  The next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and keep your 
; eye on the sky.
