; FOTD -- July 29, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The work is still backed up here at good old Fractal Central, so 
; the discussion will need to be short and to the point.
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the east branch of the second valley 
; of the northern period-3 bud-complex (radical) of the Mandelbrot 
; set.
; 
; Most of the effect of swirling comets is due to the unusual 
; coloring, which I worked out before things fell behind.  Many 
; registers of the color palette are dead black, as can be seen by 
; striking the 'e' key with the image on the screen.  I could 
; probably have gotten the same effect more easily by setting the 
; 'logmap' to a much higher number, but the image turned out 
; pretty well the way it is, so I let it be.
; 
; I decided on the name "Magic Mandelbrot" when nothing better 
; came to mind.  The rating of a 7 is satisfactory if not 
; exceptional.  The render time of a fast 5 minutes makes running 
; the included parameter file a breeze.
; 
; Those who dislike high winds may pick up the finished image from 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Wednesday was extremely hot and humid here at Fractal Central, 
; with the reported temperature in the city reaching 104F 40C.  
; The heat confined the fractal cats to the coolest indoor spot 
; they could find.  At 6pm, when a heavy rain squall blew up, the 
; electricity went out and the cool air went off.  The cats went 
; out onto the porch when the rain stopped, where it was now 
; cooler than inside.  Thursday was notably cooler and drier.  The 
; duo enjoyed several hours in the yard.  Today is starting cool, 
; but it is cloudy and threatening rain.  I hope the cats are 
; ready for an inside day.  For me, the work is still very heavy.  
; If nothing goes wrong, the next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and be at peace with whatever you are at 
; peace with.
