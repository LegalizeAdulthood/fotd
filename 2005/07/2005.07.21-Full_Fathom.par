; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- July 21, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I began the day with the discovery that I had won a total of 4.3 
; million dollars in lotteries that I have never entered, and that 
; there are five people who want to place a total of 135 million 
; dollars in my bank account.  (One of them even knows my full 
; name.)  I will soon be wealthy beyond my wildest dreams, then it 
; will be goodbye working world, hello world of fun and leisure.
; 
; These letters have ceased being a source of annoyance, and have 
; become a source of amusement.  Could anyone possibly be dumb 
; enough to fall for such obvious scams?  I guess so.  The scams 
; are showing no signs of going away.
; 
; Fractals are not going away either, and there are far more 
; fractals than there ever could be scams.  Today's image is an 
; evaporated scene in the fractal that results when various 
; negative portions of Z^(-1.4) and Z^(-6) are combined, then 
; (1/C) is added.
; 
; The parent fractal is an intricate but indescribable thing with 
; numerous bays, buds and valleys.  Today's scene is located in 
; one of the less obvious valleys.
; 
; For some unknown reason I named the image "Full Fathom", which I 
; think is a nautical term used by submariners.  If not, I stand 
; (or rather sit) corrected.
; 
; Today's image is only a minimum improvement over yesterday's, so 
; I have rated it at a 5.  Overall, the image is too chaotic.  It 
; has no definite theme to give it unity.  The colors seem too 
; arbitrary, with too much of an overall blue cast.  Perhaps the 
; FOTD for tomorrow will be better.
; 
; The great fractal images just don't seem to be appearing as they 
; should.  Maybe I need a short break to recharge whatever it is 
; that leads me to the better images.  But we'll give it a few 
; more days before deciding whether to take a vacation.
; 
; With its 16-minute render time, today's image is slow.  A big 
; speed-up is available on the internet however, on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the completed image is posted ready for viewing.
; 
; A high temperature of 90F 32C here at Fractal Central on Wed-
; nesday was made more bearable by lower humidity.  At least the 
; fractal cats thought so, as they spent over two hours lounging 
; in the shade of the holly patch.  For me it was an unusually 
; busy day.  Today is starting about the same.  I expect similar 
; results from the cats.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours. 
; Until then, take care, and be free within limits.
