; FOTD -- July 24, 2005 (Rating NONE)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things unexpectedly turned very busy here at Fractal Central on 
; Saturday, and I had no time to search for a new fractal.  When 
; this happens, I always return to the best, most prolific fractal 
; of all, the Mandelbrot set, where all the other fractals have 
; their origin.  Once again, the M-set did not let me down.
; 
; I gave today's image no rating, since I had almost nothing to do 
; with its creation.  I merely went to the eastern shoreline of 
; the main bay of the M-set, where I know such scenes are waiting, 
; and picked the first midget I saw.  The color palette appeared 
; when I struck the 'enter' key, and was fine-tuned with a few 
; more key strokes in little more than a minute.
; 
; Though I did not rate the image, I did give it a name.  In my 
; mind's eye, the overall hazy blue effect makes the scene appear 
; delicate.  I named the image "Fractal Delicacy".
; 
; Perhaps the most striking thing about today's image is the 
; appearance of the pale pink basins, hovering around the thicker 
; fractal arms like a cloud of fireflies hovering around a grove 
; of trees.  These areas are of a very high iteration count, where 
; exploration is very slow and tedious, though some unusual scenes 
; are to be found there.
; 
; The render time of today's image is under 3 minutes, a short 
; enough wait to glimpse an image that is almost free of human 
; involvement.  (Of course if there were no humans, there might be 
; no Mandelbrot set, but this is another story.)
; 
; For maximum convenience, the completed image is available at the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; There could soon be a change in the FOTD web site, so stay tuned.
; 
; With brilliant sun, a high temperature of only 86F 30C, and 
; lower humidity, Saturday was a very satisfactory day for the 
; fractal duo of cats, who spent a good part of the morning and 
; the entire afternoon outside.  Luckily, they kept out of 
; trouble.  When they came in, they were ready to settle down to 
; sleep without their usual tuna.  Today is starting about the 
; same.  It looks like another good day for the duo.
; 
; For me it looks like a busy day.  The next FOTD will likely, 
; though not certainly appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and search for the secrets of life.  The answers might lie in 
; fractals.
