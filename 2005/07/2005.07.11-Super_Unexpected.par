; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In yesterday's discussion of the 'unexpected' fractal, I 
; commented on an unusual area of chaos connected with the south 
; branch of Seahorse Valley and lying some distance from the main 
; figure.  Since then, I have examined this chaotic area and found 
; it more interesting than expected.  In fact, the area holds 
; intact midgets, one of which appears as today's image.  I am now 
; wondering what this area will change into when I tweak the 
; parameters.  Perhaps by the time tomorrow's image appears, we 
; shall know.
; 
; Instead of the well-defined bands of equal-iteration count, in 
; today's image we see symmetrically-arranged bits and pieces of 
; decorative reddish-green elements floating before a chaotic 
; purplish background.  An unexpected quadratic Mandelbrot midget 
; lies, as usual, at the center of the frame, serving as a 
; unifying theme.
; 
; I named today's image "Super Unexpected", since the chaotic area 
; appears to be the beginning of something entirely new, unlike 
; anything that exists in the classic M-set.  Because of its 
; colors, on which I put a bit of extra effort, the image rates 
; a 7.  A 6-1/2 might be more accurate, but I wanted to give 
; myself a little pat on the back.
; 
; The render time of 16 minutes is appropriate for such an 
; unexpected scene.  And even this short time may be eliminated by 
; downloading the finished GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A slightly hot 88F 31C but otherwise absolutely perfect day here 
; at Fractal Central on Sunday gave the fractal cats abundant 
; reason to pass the afternoon sleeping in the holly thicket.  
; Their repose was uninterrupted by wandering tomcats.  Today is 
; starting sunny and a bit warmer.  It might be too warm for the 
; duo to spend another afternoon outside.  For me it's work first, 
; fractals second, the next of which will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and take it easy when pondering the 
; imponderable.
