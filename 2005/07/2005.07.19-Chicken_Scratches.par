; FOTD -- July 19, 2005 (Rating 2)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It has been a long time since the FOTD has claimed as its own a 
; fractal with a rating as low as a 2.  On most days today's image 
; would have earned a strike of the delete key without a moment's 
; hesitation.  But Monday was not an ordinary day.  Finding a good 
; fractal image was about as easy as finding a hundred-dollar bill 
; lying on the sidewalk.  Despite my searches, I found nothing at 
; all worth a second look.  It was almost as though the fractal 
; world had suddenly turned against me, and fought my every effort 
; to find a worthwhile fractal.  It is a thing (call it lack of 
; inspiration?) that plagues artists, though I can see no reason 
; why it should afflict me, since I do not claim to be an artist.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's failure was created by combining 
; Z^(-1.6) with Z^(-8.6) before adding (1/C).  It is in the shape 
; of a large unimpressive Mandeloid with a smaller Mandelbrot set 
; nearby to the northeast.  The two features are connected by a 
; broken string of fractal nodes.  Today's image lies in one of 
; these nodes, very near the point where it breaks off from a 
; period-5 bud.
; 
; Today's image features ('features' is hardly the right word) a 
; central midget surrounded by disconnected scratchy looking 
; filaments, all of it together adding up to basically nothing.  
; The coloring could be far better, but I fear no amount of 
; coloring could raise the image to above average.
; 
; While searching for a name, I could not shake the impression of 
; a chicken yard, where, for countless days, countless chickens 
; have been scratching for food, or whatever chickens scratch for. 
; The name "Chicken Scratches" quickly followed.
; 
; Luckily, the render time of the included parameter file is a 
; fast 1 minute.  Even luckier, the finished image is available 
; for download on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather stayed dry here at Fractal Central on Monday, but 
; the 90F 32C heat and the high humidity kept the cats' activity 
; to a minimum.  They passed the afternoon sleeping in the holly 
; hollow.  Today is starting about the same.  It looks like 
; another lazy day for the duo.  For me it looks like another 
; active day.  A much improved fractal is almost certain in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and don't remember to not 
; forget.
