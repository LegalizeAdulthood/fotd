; FOTD -- July 23, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The FOTD rating continues creeping up.  Maybe, if the present 
; trend continues, we will be back at a rating of 8 in a couple 
; days.
; 
; Today's image is a zoom into one of the northern filaments of 
; yesterday's image, so the features bear a strong resemblance.  
; But the magnitude is 10^12 times that of yesterday's image, 
; which makes the image more interesting.  It also makes the 
; render time about 650 times as long, which is not so interesting.
; 
; I named the image "Mandelbrot Midget-2", the most logical name I 
; could think of.  There are two ways to see the image.  The slow 
; way is to run the included parameter file and have a relaxing 
; wait.  The fast way is to download the finished image from the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The high temperature of 93F 34C on Friday here at F.C. was a 
; bit too much for the fractal cats to take.  They cut short their 
; outdoor time after only 45 minutes in the holly patch, and 
; settled under the cool air vent for the rest of the day.  This 
; morning is starting somewhat cooler and less humid.  The cats 
; will likely approve of the conditions.
; 
; For me it looks like a rather busy day coming up.  There is some 
; graphic work to be done and, if I feel extra energetic, grass to 
; be trimmed.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and are dreams real?
