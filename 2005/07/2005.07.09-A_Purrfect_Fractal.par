; FOTD -- July 09, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To produce today's image, I took yesterday's parent fractal and 
; raised Z^1 to Z^1.01.  The minute change completely altered the 
; appearance of the fractal, changing it from a hyperbola to a 
; distorted M-set.  I commented about the change to Thomas, one of 
; the fractal cats who was lying nearby.  When he looked up and 
; started purring, I had the name for today's image.  I named it 
; "A Purrfect Fractal".
; 
; Though I had the name, I had not yet found the fractal.  But a 
; quick search along an interesting stretch of shoreline found a 
; string of vaguely elephant-shaped things, and today's image 
; turned up in one of the almost-trunks.
; 
; I rendered the scene with the outside set to 'summ'.  The effect 
; is rather pleasing, though nothing to brag about.  I could rate 
; the image no higher than a 6, which is still a bit above average.
; 
; Perhaps the greatest drawback is the images's slowness.  Forty 
; minutes is really a bit too much time to spend on such a routine 
; image.  But as always, the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; comes to the rescue.  The already-rendered GIF image will soon 
; be posted there, ready to be downloaded in less than a minute.
; 
; The rain slacked off during the afternoon here at Fractal 
; Central on Friday, but the ground was so wet that the fractal 
; cats decided to remain on the porch.  After voicing his opinion 
; about the fractal, Thomas was quite satisfied.  Tippy wondered 
; what the fuss was about.  Today is starting peaceful enough, 
; with some sun and acceptable temperatures.  It should be a good 
; day for the cat duo.  For me it looks like the day will be 
; average.  The next FOTD will probably appear in 24 hours.  If 
; not, it will appear in 48 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; how can there be an end to anything if spacetime is eternal?
