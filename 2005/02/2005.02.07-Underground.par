; FOTD -- February 07, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I had intended on finding a great fractal on Sunday, but you 
; know how it is -- one gets flopped down in front of the TV, the 
; big game is coming on in only an hour, and there is no pressing 
; reason to get up.  This happened to me on Sunday.  I did not get 
; up, and as a result, today's fractal is not great -- it is 
; merely average -- but it is far better than the fractal with the 
; rating of 2 that passed for yesterday's FOTD.  Today's image 
; rates a 5, and it earns its rating.
; 
; The image is a scene in a valley of the sprawling parent fractal 
; that results when a large portion of Z^(-1.26) is combined with 
; 1/10 as much Z^(-12.6) and (1/C) is added.
; 
; The area is one where the outside material has partially 
; evaporated, and many 'inside' areas exist beyond the limits of 
; the midget itself.  To bring these evaporated areas to life, I 
; have rendered the image with the inside set to 'fmod' and the 
; proximity to 1.
; 
; The result is a fractal that shows a midget surrounded by what 
; can best be described as squiggly slimy earthworms.  Worms might 
; me a suitable name for a cheap horror movie, but not for a high 
; class production such as the FOTD.  So I named the image 
; "Underground", which is the place where the squiggly slimy worms 
; are found.
; 
; With a render time on my worn-out machine of almost 25 minutes, 
; today's image is bordering on slowness.  But salvation is at 
; hand in the form of the FOTD web site, where the finished image 
; is available for download.  The site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A repeat perfect day here at Fractal Central on Sunday made for 
; continued happy cats.  They spent the entire afternoon lurking 
; in the holly thicket, watching for prey to stray too close.  No 
; prey strayed close enough to pounce on, and the duo had to 
; settle for their standard evening treat of tuna.  Today is 
; starting with some clouds, but there is still a lot of sun and 
; it is still mild.  Will the duo notice the weaker sun?  Check 
; here tomorrow to find out.
; 
; My day looks like it will be busier than the past few, but not 
; so busy that the fractals will suffer.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and stay alert for 
; runaway fractals.
