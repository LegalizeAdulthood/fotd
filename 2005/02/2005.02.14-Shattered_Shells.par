; FOTD -- February 14, 2005 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal image is so different, so striking, that little 
; can be said about it.  The image speaks for itself.  I am not 
; going to speculate about where the voice comes from, but when 
; the image is viewed, the fractal voice will be heard.
; 
; To find the image, I made a slight change in the parent fractal 
; that I have been using for about a week.  I increased the 
; portion of Z^(-1.26) from 5 to 9, a change that causes the whole 
; fractal to shrink while keeping most of its overall features 
; intact.
; 
; I then searched along the southeast shoreline of the large 
; circular bay.  This bay is unusual in that it has no obvious 
; buds along its shoreline, but as today's image shows, it does 
; have midgets.
; 
; When I found today's scene, I tried the usual tricks on it.  I 
; tried all the 'outside' options and found the 'tdis' option 
; works best.  Then I evaporated the image and found that none of 
; the 'inside' options makes as good an image as the unevaporated 
; outside=tdis version, though the 'bof60' option works best.
; 
; Finally, I set the escape radius to 500,000,000, which results 
; in a half-evaporated image.  I kept the outside parts set to 
; 'tdis', the inside parts set to 'bof60', and the result was the 
; skeletal framework of today's image.  The final step was finding 
; a color palette that brings out the best in an image that is 
; only half there.
; 
; Though Fractint has only 256-color capability, it gives maximum 
; versatility to those limited colors, and after a half hour or so 
; I had worked up the palette that makes today's image one of the 
; few FOTD's that can honestly be said to rate a 9.
; 
; When it came time to name the image, I studied it a few minutes, 
; then saw a collection of colorful broken shells scattered on a 
; fractal beach.  I named the image "Shattered Shells", the name 
; it will carry for all time.
; 
; The render time of 7-1/2 minutes is quite reasonable for one of 
; the best FOTD fractal images.  But rendering may be avoided 
; entirely by downloading the finished image from the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The enlightening and informative, (at least IMO), philosophy 
; continues in the philofractal version of today's FOTD discussion.
; 
; The weather on Sunday was partly cloudy with a high temperature 
; of 46F 8C.  The fractal cats, who most certainly eat food other 
; than tuna, spent about 2 hours lurking in the holly thicket, 
; looking for excitement than never happened.  When they came 
; inside, a small treat of tuna eased their disappointment.  (The 
; tuna is only a special treat.  The dynamic duo's main diet is 
; the variety of food that all well-fed cats eat.)  But today is 
; starting cold and rainy.  I see a bad day coming up for the duo.
; 
; For me, the commercial work is average, but there is that next 
; installment of philosophy to start work on.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours; the next philosophy will take several days 
; longer.  Until tomorrow, same time same place, take care, and be 
; ready for anything.
