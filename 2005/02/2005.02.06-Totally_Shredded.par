; FOTD -- February 06, 2005 (Rating 2)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is far from great.  In fact, with its low-as-
; they-go rating of 2, it is far from being even average.  Maybe 
; I'm getting too interested in philosophy.  Maybe I have put so 
; much energy into fractals that I'm beginning to burn out.  Why 
; else would I search where I have searched hundreds of times and 
; rarely found anything of even average interest?
; 
; I don't know why I keep looking along the filaments of very low 
; order Mandeloid fractals for interesting midgets.  The midgets 
; are there, but they are so broken by the unavoidable discontinui-
; ties that they look like they have just gone through a paper 
; shredder.  Today's image shows a totally shredded midget that 
; fully deserves its abysmal rating of 2 as well as its name -- 
; "Totally Shredded".
; 
; The parent fractal is the default Z^1.26+C Mandeloid.  I hoped 
; that the cube root of 3 would do something unusual when used as 
; the exponent of Z, but as far as I could tell, nothing out of 
; the ordinary happened.  Maybe if I had checked other levels of 
; the logarithmic hyper-spiral, I would have found something more 
; interesting, but somehow I doubt it.
; 
; I could also have done better with the coloring, but today's 
; earthy palette seems to perfectly capture the futility I felt 
; when working with the image.  The parameter file included at the 
; end of this message runs in 7 minutes on my 10-year-old machine 
; with the exhaust fan that needs to be started by hand.  But much 
; of that render time may be saved by downloading the fully pre-
; rendered GIF image from the FOTD web site maintained by Paul at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The sun was warm, the wind was light, and the temperature 
; reached 54F 12C.  It was absolutely perfect here at Fractal 
; Central on Saturday, and the cats made the most of the perfect 
; conditions.  They went into the yard before 11am and did not 
; return inside until after 4pm.  For some reason they wanted 
; extra tuna for supper, which I gave them.  Then they ended the 
; day with one of their rare spells of playfully chasing each 
; other up and down the stairs.  Today is starting much the same.  
; Hopefully, the aging duo is not all played out.
; 
; I have little to do today but watch the big game.  If the game 
; is dull, I'll enjoy the over-priced ads.  The next fractal will 
; appear in 24 hours, the next philosophy, most likely in 48.  
; Until tomorrow, when the fractal of the day is guaranteed to be 
; an improvement over today's, take care, and there will never be 
; another 2-rated fractal until spammers learn to spell correctly.
