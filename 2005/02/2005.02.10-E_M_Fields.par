; FOTD -- February 10, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In yesterday's philo discussion, I stated that the 'big bang' is 
; estimated to have happened around 12,000,000,000 years ago.  No 
; sooner had I sent off the FOTD than the postperson delivered the 
; March issue of 'Scientific American' magazine, which contains an 
; article on common errors about the expanding universe.  In the 
; article it is stated that the latest estimate of the age of the 
; universe is now 14,000,000,000 years, and not the 12,000,000,000 
; years that I assumed.  I was off by 2,000,000,000 years.  Oh 
; well, with all the other debatable assumptions in my philofrac-
; tal discussion, 2-billion years is not going to make much of a 
; difference.
; 
; Today's image is most certainly not an assumptiom.  It is an 
; evaporated scene in the same parent fractal that we have been 
; exploring for the past several days and will be exploring for 
; several days to come.  I named the image "E-M-Fields" for no 
; particular reason, though these fields, which permeate the 
; modern-day environment, certainly must have quite a few fractal 
; aspects.  And BTW, EMF pollution is another of my pet peeves, 
; but that's a story for another day.
; 
; Today's image is located in a disconnected bit of debris in a 
; minor valley on the southwest shoreline of the large circular 
; bay of the parent fractal.  I rated the image at a 6.  The soft 
; greenish-grey daisy-like features around the edge of the image 
; are soothing enough, but the too-tight cropping and too-gaudy 
; colors in the spirals give the image a hectic feeling that keeps 
; the rating from reaching a 7, the level where images can start 
; feeling proud of themselves.
; 
; Images speak louder than words, so don't just read about today's 
; FOTD image.  See it...by running the included parameter file or 
; by downloading the completed GIF image from the FOTD web site at:

; 
; Wednesday turned out to be unexpectedly pleasant here at Fractal 
; Central, with some sun and a high temperature of 61F 16C.  The 
; dynamic cats had a day that was better than expected also.  But 
; this morning is chilly and blustery.  The cats' good day will 
; not be repeated.
; 
; My day should be passably good -- as soon as I get the work 
; behind me, that is.  And the next glorious fractal will appear 
; in only 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and where were we when 
; the big bang went boom?
