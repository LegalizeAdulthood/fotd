; FOTD -- February 23, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I enjoy finding well-defined fractal 'objects', such as the 
; mathematical dead-ends for wandering points known as 'midgets' 
; or sometimes 'atoms'.  The assemblage illustrated in today's 
; image might or might not be considered a fractal 'object', but 
; it is an interesting collection of fractal things regardless, 
; and it is invisibly filled with the true well-defined 'objects' 
; known as midgets.
; 
; I named the image "Seeing Triple".  The name is an exaggeration 
; of the more common phrase 'seeing double'.  The name came about 
; when I noticed that the image had left-right symmetry.  Then I 
; looked again and discovered that the opposites were reflections 
; of reflections.  They were identical.  A third look revealed 
; that the opposites are not reflections or rotations at all -- 
; they are totally different, and no reflection or rotation can 
; ever make them coincide.
; 
; The parent fractal combines negative portions of Z^(-1.26) and 
; Z^(-12.6).  It is a variation of the parent which produced the 
; series of FOTD images that ended about a week ago.
; 
; The coloring features pastel tints inside the non-symmetrical 
; objects, which contrasts with the intense deep blues of the 
; surrounding environment.  I am not sure the rating of 7 is 
; totally earned, but the image does appear to be at least above 
; the FOTD average.
; 
; The render time of 7 minutes is within reason.  If 7 minutes is 
; not reasonable, the wait can be eliminated entirely by down-
; loading the completed GIF image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The sun broke through in mid-afternoon Tuesday here at Fractal 
; Central, but the temperature reached only 45F 7C, which was a 
; bit too chilly for the paws of the fractal cats, who spent only 
; 45 minutes outside.  Their evening was improved however by a 
; generous treat of tuna.  Today is starting partly cloudy and 
; colder.  It looks rather bleak for the duo.
; 
; For me the day looks normal -- at least so far.  The next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until that magnificent moment arrives, 
; take care, but have fun.
