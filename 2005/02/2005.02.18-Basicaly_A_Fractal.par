; FOTD -- February 18, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's fractal image we return to the grand-daddy of all 
; fractals, the Mandelbrot set, where we examine a tiny midget 
; near the extremity of the negative stem.
; 
; We are in an area where the bailout radius makes a tremendous 
; difference in the appearance of the image, especially when the 
; image has been rendered with the 'outside' set to 'summ'.
; 
; Though the magnitude of today's image is in the arbitrary 
; precision range, it is still a fast one, rendering in under 2 
; minutes on my machine, making it easy to check the effect of 
; changing the bailout radius.
; 
; This area of the M-set has been so thoroughly explored that 
; little remains to be said about the image other than to state 
; the fact that it is basically a fractal, which explains the 
; name, "Basically a Fractal".
; 
; I was ready to rate the image at an average 5, but then I found 
; today's color palette.  The colors work unusually well on this 
; particular image, and enabled me to raise the rating to a 7.
; 
; As has been the case for a number of years, the completed image 
; has been posted for download on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The philosophy is not yet ready, and will take a few days yet.  
; But anything worth having is worth waiting for, so be patient 
; and remember that patience is rewarded.
; 
; A cold wind brought flurries of snow to Fractal Central Thursday 
; afternoon.  The fractal cats tried to enjoy their time in the 
; yard, but the temperature just above freezing was too chilly for 
; their sensitive whiskers, and they came inside after less than 
; 15 minutes.  A generous serving of tuna eased their disappoint-
; ment.  With a temperature of 25F -4C, today is starting even 
; colder, and more flurries are in the area.  Things do not look 
; good for the duo.
; 
; My day will consist of work and fun.  The work comes first; the 
; fun comes later.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and decide on your fractal.
