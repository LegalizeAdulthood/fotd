; FOTD -- February 24, 2005 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To start, I must admit that today's Julia-like image is 
; abysmally slow.  And that is not all.  It is merely close to 
; being a Julia set.  In fact, it is within 1/2 degree of arc of 
; actually being a Julia set.  But it is not a Julia set; it is 
; "Close but no Cigar".  If the image were a Julia set, it would 
; consist of nothing but the spider-like arms in the foreground.  
; The brilliant, straight-edged, horizontal bar in the background, 
; partially showing through the spider arms, is actually a grossly 
; enlarged and infinitely stretched view of the area of the Mandel-
; brot set associated with this particular Julia set.
; 
; The pure Julia version may be seen by changing the imag(p1) 
; parameter from 90.5 to 90.  One benefit of this change is that 
; the Julia set renders in 1/10 the time of the 'almost' Julia 
; set.  The spidery arms in the pure Julia set are thicker and not 
; nearly as intricate as those of the 'almost' set, especially in 
; the lower part of the image.  And unless I am mistaken, there 
; are fewer arms in the pure Julia set.  Of course, in the Julia 
; set the straight-edged feature in the background, which adds 
; most of the interest, is totally missing.
; 
; The very slow render time of today's image is a bit misleading.  
; When I first rendered the image, I used the old version of the 
; multXYZWcompjb-min formula.  Since then, I have moved the term 
; (c^(p3-1)) to the initialization part of the formula, which lets 
; it be calculated only once for each point rather than recalcula-
; ted at every iteration.  This cuts the render time almost in 
; half.  All previous versions of the multXYZWcompjb-min formula 
; should be replaced with the version that is included in today's 
; parameter file.  The 'frm:' that precedes the formula name must 
; be removed before the formula can be included in a formula file.
; 
; I have rated the image at an 8.  This might be a bit overblown, 
; but I rather like the image, and feel that it is worth the 8.  
; But even with the new version of the formula, the image is a 
; slow one that is much more convenient to download.  I have sent 
; the image on ahead to Paul, so it should be posted to the FOTD 
; web site, ready for download, shortly after you read this.  The 
; web site may be accessed at:

; 
; Wednesday turned out not too bad here at Fractal Central.  The 
; sun was visible about half the time and the temperature reached 
; 43F 6C, which is about where it should be at this time of year.  
; The cats spent about an hour in the yard, which is a little 
; below their normal time outdoors.  Their evening tuna was near 
; average.  But this morning I see light snow falling, with heavy 
; snow forecast for later today.  The duo might not have a good 
; day.
; 
; I expect an average day, but then, even an average day is filled 
; with things of interest.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours. 
; Until then, take care, and look beneath the surface of the 
; everyday things of life.
