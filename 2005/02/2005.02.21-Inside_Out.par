; FOTD -- February 21, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's fractal adventure I tried to duplicate one of the 
; curious rectangles that exist in the Z^2.003+C Julia set with a 
; C value of -1.7435.  When I searched the Z^4.003+C Julia sets, 
; I found no more rectangles, but I did find a very interesting 
; Julia set.  Today's image is part of this Julia set.
; 
; The scene has been rendered in the usual way, with the outside 
; set to 'iter' and the inside set to the number zero.  The 
; unusually delicate, lace-like effect is part of the fractal and 
; not a result of program trickery.
; 
; The rating of a 7 might be a bit high.  I am not totally pleased 
; with the colors, which are a bit too intense, and create a 
; certain feeling of 'trying too hard'.
; 
; I named the image "Inside-Out".  I can see absolutely nothing in 
; the image that could inspire such a name, but all FOTD images 
; need a name, so "Inside-Out it is.
; 
; The render time of 18 minutes borders on slowness, but may be 
; avoided by downloading the finished GIF image from the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A bit of philosophy is included in the philofractal version of 
; today's discussion.
; 
; Sunday was cloudy and chilly here at Fractal Central, but the 
; over-forecasted snow failed to arrive and the temperature of 41F 
; 5C was just warm enough to give the cats an hour in the holly 
; thicket.  They would have preferred more time outdoors however, 
; so a generous treat of tuna was needed to get them back in their 
; usual good moods.  Today is starting foggy and drizzly, but it 
; is milder.  If things dry out, the duo might have a reasonable 
; day.
; 
; My day will feature more of the same.  The next FOTD will appear 
; in 24 hours, with all the trimmings.  Until then, take care, and 
; expect the best.
