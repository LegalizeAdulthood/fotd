; FOTD -- February 13, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a repeat of the theme of yesterday's fractal, 
; where a midget is surrounded by concentric closed paths.  But in 
; today's image the scene has been evaporated and the remnants 
; made visible by the 'bof61' inside fill, which is the only 
; inside option that produces a worthwhile effect when applied to 
; today's, and most other, evaporated scenes.
; 
; The parent fractal is the same one that we have been working 
; with for about a week now.  To find today's image I examined one 
; of the isolated areas of chaos that surrounds the main body of 
; the fractal like an electron cloud surrounds an atom.  (An 
; electron cloud is where an atom's electrons might be located.  
; Electrons have no definite locations in an atom until we deter-
; mine their locations by observing them.)
; 
; The overall effect of the image is one of a lush tropical rain 
; forest, and this is what I would have named it if I had not 
; already named it "A Repeated Scene".  But, bearing the best name 
; or not, the image still rates a 7, and it renders in under 2 
; minutes.
; 
; The image is available, already rendered, on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A brief flurry of snow an hour before noon on Saturday did not 
; deter the duo, for when the snow passed off, the sun returned 
; and the temperature rose to 50F 10C.  This is not exactly balmy, 
; but the cats took their coats with them when they went out.  
; After a pleasant and uneventful afternoon, they returned indoors 
; to enjoy their evening tuna.  Today is starting much like yester-
; day, though I see no signs of snow showers.  I expect a good day.
; 
; I see little in store for myself today except fractals and TV.  
; A do-nothing day is welcome now and then, but we would not want 
; every day to be idle.  I still have the philosophy to shape up 
; however.  So I'll set the chances at 50 percent that the next 
; installment of philosophy will appear in the philofractal 
; version of tomorrow's FOTD -- 80 percent that it will appear by 
; Tuesday.  But the chance that the next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours is 99.99 percent.  Until then, take care, and search for 
; the light in a sea of darkness.
