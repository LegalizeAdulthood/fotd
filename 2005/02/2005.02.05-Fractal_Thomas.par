; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I was doing a bit of casual exploring in the fourth dimension 
; yesterday, when I suddenly saw on the screen the face of Thomas, 
; one of the fractal cats, peering out at me.  It immediately 
; reminded me of the way Thomas actually peers from the bushes 
; before coming into the open to check that everything is in 
; order and no danger is about.  The name "Fractal Thomas" came 
; to mind almost at once.
; 
; The actual scene is a view of the Seahorse Valley of a tiny 
; midget deep in East Valley of the large midget on the main stem 
; of the classic Mandelbrot set.  Yes, I realize that it looks 
; nothing at all like either a Seahorse Valley or an East Valley.  
; This is because the image is oriented in one of the oblique 
; directions through the four-dimensional Julibrot.
; 
; The resemblance to one of the fractal cats is striking enough, 
; but I have seen such images many times, and could rate today's 
; image no higher than an average 5.  This is not to say that 
; Thomas is an average cat.  Quite the contrary.  He is tied with 
; Tippy for number one cat in the world.  It is just that today's 
; representation of him does not do him justice.  Only a real 
; photograph could do that, and even then it would be difficult to 
; capture his full personality.
; 
; Speaking of photographs, I still am planning on getting a brand-
; new digital electronic camera to replace my old film-loaded 
; Pentax that stopped working sometime during the 15 or so years 
; that have passed since I found fractals and stopped using it.  
; The fractal cats will not be around forever, and I would like to 
; have some pictures of them before they go where good cats go.  
; Taking their pictures seems such a simple thing, and there 
; appears to be so much time in which to do it, that I never get 
; motivated to go out shopping for a digital camera.
; 
; This is curious, for I really enjoy photography.  At one time I 
; was an avid photographer who did my own black-and-white as well 
; as color darkroom work.  I was most interested in infrared and 
; ultraviolet photography, which showed the familiar everyday 
; surroundings in a new light.  Using infrared film, I even caught 
; some pictures of the things that ghost hunters now call orbs -- 
; moving balls of light that are sometimes photographed in 
; locations said to be haunted by ghosts.  At the time I thought 
; the spots on the film were flaws in the film or specks of dust 
; floating very near the lens.  I am far from convinced that I 
; caught glimpses of an unknown energy on film, but I have never 
; understood why such spots appeared only in the infrared photo-
; graphs and on so many different batches and brands of infrared 
; film.
; 
; Well, I see that we are again wandering from the topic, which is 
; fractals and not photographic oddities, so it's time to remind 
; everyone that seven minutes may be saved if today's fractal is 
; downloaded from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Friday brought little sun, but the temperature reached 46F 8C, 
; which was just into the comfort range of the dynamic cats.  They 
; spent several hours in the yard, peeping from the bushes much as 
; we see Thomas doing in today's image.  When evening arrived, 
; they came indoors ready to settle down without complaint.  I 
; gave them their regular treat of tuna to be sure they didn't 
; complain.  Today is starting warmer with full sun.  The duo 
; should have another fine day.
; 
; For me, the work is mostly caught up.  A few minor chores 
; remain, but they can be done in less than an hour.  Then it will 
; be time for fractals and philosophy.  The next fractal will 
; appear in 24 hours; the next chapter of philosophy will take a 
; day or two longer.  Until tomorrow's FOTD, take care, and isn't 
; it wonderful.
