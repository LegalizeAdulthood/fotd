; FOTD -- February 26, 2005 (Rating 10)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The rating of today's image is no typo.  I feel it is actually 
; worth a 10, making it only the second FOTD image to achieve this 
; supreme rating.  Not only is it one of the most unusual fractal 
; images I have yet seen, everything about it excels.  The 
; coloring is excellent; the mathematical interest is excellent; 
; the uniqueness is excellent.  In short, the image is so close to 
; perfection that when I considered its minor faults, the rating 
; still rounded off to an actual 10.
; 
; The name "Tessellation" was inspired by the branch-like arms in 
; the upper half of the image, which appear to have been covered 
; with a tile mosaic.  By contrast, the lower half of the image 
; consists of a carnival-like riot of brilliantly colored bits and 
; strips of fractal debris.  The dividing line between the upper 
; half and lower half is extremely sharp, yet the features still 
; appear continuous across the divide to some degree.
; 
; The image was created by the formula (-Z)^1.2*(C^0.1)+C, which 
; is the same formula that created the 'No_Cigar' image of Feb 24. 
; In today's image I picked a point near the northern shoreline of 
; the main bay of the parent Mandeloid, but still located some 
; distance offshore, and calculated an almost-Julia set rotated 
; only 0.2 degree from the Julia direction.
; 
; When this open figure is rendered with the 'inside=0' option, it 
; is blank.  Most of the active inside fills work wonders with it 
; however.  I chose the 'inside=bof61' option for today's image, 
; but the other inside options are well worth a try.
; 
; The render time of 10-1/2 minutes is well within reason for such 
; an outstanding image.  For extra convenience, the completed GIF 
; image has been posted to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Limited sun, a temperature of only 36F 2C, and snow-covered 
; ground, kept the dynamic fractal cats safely inside all day 
; Friday here at Fractal Central.  They did venture briefly onto 
; the porch to check conditions, but turned back inside before the 
; door was closed, to spend the rest of the afternoon on their 
; comfortable shelf by the window.  Today is starting about the 
; same as yesterday.  I expect the duo to have a similar day.
; 
; For me the work is light, but fractal lady is thinking about a 
; browsing trip to one of the local antique and collectible 
; emporiums.  Maybe seeing some of the old stuff people have 
; thrown away will give me a few new fractal ideas.  The next FOTD 
; will not rate as high as today's, but it will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and don't be disappointed.  Some 
; day we might find another FOTD that rates a 10.
