; FOTD -- February 27, 2005 (Rating 10+)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; No one but no one is perfect, and I am not Mister No-One.  I 
; made a minor error when I posted yesterday's 'Tessellation' 
; image.  I had calculated and made parameter files of two 
; versions of the same scene, one with the functions set to 
; flip/ident, the other with the functions set to ident/flip.  
; I inadvertently included the wrong parameter file in 
; yesterday's FOTD.  
; 
; The flip/ident image, which was drawn by yesterday's parameter 
; file, rates a 9.5, which I rounded off to a 10.  The ident/flip 
; image, which is drawn by today's file, rates a 9.7, which also 
; rounds off to a 10.
; 
; Today's image is basically the same as yesterday's, but the 
; overall form is in a different orientation and the tessellation 
; in the upper half is even more impressive.  The problem is that 
; I gave yesterday's image a rating of 10, which is the highest 
; possible rating, yet today's image is slightly better, and there 
; is no such thing as a rating of 11.  (Such a rating would be as 
; meaningless as the claim that one owns 10 square kilometers of 
; land 100 miles north of the north pole.)  This is why I have 
; always been conservative in my ratings.  But I had to do 
; something to show that today's image exceeds yesterday's, so I 
; gave today's image a rating of 10+ and left it to the viewer to 
; decide exactly what such a rating means.
; 
; I could have named today's image something like, "Son of 
; Tessellation" or "The Return of the Tessellation" or "The Curse 
; of the Tessellation" or "The Tessellation Strikes Again".  But 
; in keeping with the current trend in the film industry, I named 
; it "Tessellation-II".
; 
; The render time of 12 minutes may be avoided by downloading the 
; finished image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; As expected, I was away all Saturday afternoon, looking at the 
; things that other people had discarded.  As a result, the 
; fractal cats could not go out.  They were forced to enjoy the 
; warm sun and temperature of 46F 8C from their window shelf.  
; When we returned in the evening, the duo was rightfully irate, 
; and loudly demanded extra tuna.  Only when the tuna was 
; delivered did they settle for a quiet evening.  This morning is 
; starting sunny and calm, but cold.  I hope the duo has time 
; enough in the yard today.  More snow is forecast for tomorrow.
; 
; I expect a slow day.  Slow days make great fractals, so check 
; back tomorrow to see what happens.  It will not be another 
; repeat.  Until then, take care, and be rational but wise.
