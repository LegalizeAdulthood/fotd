; FOTD -- February 08, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's discussion will be terse.  While giving the intended 
; philosophical part of today's discussion a final reading before 
; posting, I found so many passages in need of clarification that 
; I decided to basically re-write the whole thing.  Unfortunately, 
; I used up most of the FOTD time in the process.  It is amazing 
; how obvious the poorly composed parts of a composition become 
; when they are read several days after being written.
; 
; Today's image is another scene in the same parent fractal that 
; produced the 'Underground' image of yesterday.  In fact, it is 
; located in the other branch of the same valley.  The main 
; difference is that today's image has been partially 'evaporated' 
; by raising the escape radius to 1,400,000,000 and rendering 
; the scene with the inside set to bof61.
; 
; The name I gave the image, "Cosmic Ripple", was probably 
; inspired by all the thinking I was doing at the time about the 
; origin of the universe, which is the topic of the philosophical 
; discussion I have been working on.  The rating of a 6 seems 
; about right for another of my standard images with a quadratic 
; midget at the center.
; 
; The render time of 14 minutes is slightly slow, but the slowness 
; may be avoided by downloading the already-rendered GIF image 
; from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; I regret that the promised philosophy is not ready in time to be 
; included in today's discussion.  But I am in no rush to be 
; considered a great fool -- a lesser fool is acceptable.  If I 
; get things right, the philosophy about the origin of the 
; universe will appear in the philofractal version of tomorrow's 
; discussion.  If not, it will take a day or two longer.
; 
; Near perfect weather here at Fractal Central on Monday gave the 
; fractal cats much reason to rejoice.  They ended the day happily 
; with their standard treat of tuna.  This morning is starting 
; similarly.  I expect a similar day for the duo.
; 
; For me, it looks like a day with only a moderate amount of work, 
; but I still have that philosophy to go over and re-write.  The 
; next fractal will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and search for origins, both fractal and otherwise.
