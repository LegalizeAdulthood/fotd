; FOTD -- February 25, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal was created with the MandelbrotMix3a formula, 
; which combines 4 different powers of Z but requires that the 
; critical points be calculated manually.  In today's image, 
; various portions of Z^(-5.5), Z^(1.5), Z^(2.5) and (1/Z) were 
; combined, and a critical point was entered as (p5) to produce a 
; parent fractal that consists of little more than a scattering of 
; disconnected fractal strings.  But some of the strings hold 
; curious little Mandelbrot atoms, one of which is the star of 
; today's sizzling fast image.
; 
; When rendered in the traditional manner, with the outside set to 
; 'iter', today's image is rather dull.  The 'tdis' outside option 
; brings the scene to life however, and earns the rating of a 7.  
; I chose the name "Good Versus Evil" when I noticed the contrast 
; between the strong celestial blue in the center of the image and 
; the lurid red around the edges, which hints at devilishness.  Of 
; course, in a theoretical battle of good against evil, the result 
; must always be a stalemate.  Both sides are equally powerful.
; 
; I rendered today's image with the 'passes=b' option, which is 
; the fastest with this particular image.  It is also the most fun 
; to watch.  The drawback is that it often completely misses some 
; features of the images on which it is used.
; 
; Though today's parameter file renders fast as lightning, the 
; FOTD web site, where the completed GIF image has been posted, is 
; still fun to visit.  The site is located at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Snow fell all day Thursday here at Fractal Central, keeping the 
; fractal cats confined all afternoon to their shelf by the 
; window, where they watched the birds scrounging for food.  The 
; duo must have been reasonably contented with their situation, 
; for they were satisfied with the normal serving of tuna.  This 
; morning is starting with some sun, but it is still cold and we 
; are deep in snow.  I have no idea how the duo will manage the 
; challenging conditions.
; 
; For me it's another average day with the average amount of work 
; to clear away before tackling the fractal world.  The 6 inches 
; 15cm of snow that fell yesterday is not enough to stop normal 
; activity of a rather large city, so I have no excuse to put 
; things off.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  The wrap-up 
; of the philosophy will appear a few days later.  Until next 
; time, take care, and where is Yukon King?
