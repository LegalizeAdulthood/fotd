; FOTD -- February 12, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yesterday's image was named "Most Unusual Midget", but it was 
; not really all that unusual, and rated only a 5.  Today's image, 
; which is named "The Right Path", would have been better named if 
; it had been given the name of yesterday's image.  It is the more 
; unusual of the two.
; 
; Today's image is located far to the northeast of the main part 
; of its parent fractal, which is the same fractal that has given 
; us the most recent images.  The scene is located in a cut-off 
; bit of circular debris inside a large closed ring that 
; terminates the most prominent filament leading from the main 
; part of the fractal.
; 
; The image got its name from the narrow, winding path that 
; encircles the central midget like a beltway encircles a city.  
; It is truly a path to nowhere.  One could travel it forever and 
; never arrive at an end, for, like infinity, it has no limits.
; 
; The concept of infinity is a strange thing.  It is so easy to 
; see that if one were to start traveling along the path in 
; today's image, they would never come to the end because no end 
; exists.  Yet if one tries to imagine a straight line with the 
; same endlessness, they find that their mind cannot grasp the 
; entirety of the thing.
; 
; Even harder to imagine is a half-line, a straight line with only 
; one end.  Is it infinite or not?  We can see that a straight 
; line with no ends would be longer, for it would extend into 
; regions where the half-line did not.  The answer depends on the 
; direction in which we view the line.  In one direction it is 
; infinite; in the other direction it has a certain, though 
; unimaginably great length.
; 
; This half line situation reminds me of a day in seventh grade 
; religion class in a Catholic school, when the nun was re-re-re-
; telling of how our souls will be perfectly happy in heaven 
; forever if we obey God's commandments in this life.  I asked 
; the good sister how heaven could be fair, since those good 
; people who died long ago have already had more happy time than 
; those now living, and no matter how long we are all in heaven 
; the ones who went there first will always have had more 
; happiness than the late-comers.  The sister replied that we will 
; be looking forward to our future happiness when we get to heaven 
; and not back to the hardships of earth life.  She explained that 
; everyone will be in heaven forever and will therefore have the 
; same infinite amount of perfect happiness.  I started to say, 
; "but . . .", and the sister told me to sit down and shut up.
; 
; Infinity is strange indeed.  Any quantity can be added or 
; subtracted from it and it remains unchanged.  It can be 
; multiplied or divided by any quantity, even infinity, and it 
; remains unchanged.  It can be raised to any finite power and it 
; remains unchanged.  (If it is raised to the power of infinity it 
; might become a higher order of infinity -- I am not sure.)
; 
; Well, I see myself again wandering from the topic, so it's time 
; to note that today's image rates a pretty good 7 and renders in 
; 2-1/2 minutes.  It is available for download on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Weak sun and chilling winds here at Fractal Central on Friday 
; kept the fractal cats indoors most all day.  They did manage a 
; brief 20-minute sojourn to the holly thicket to check for 
; intruders.  When they found none, they hurried back inside to 
; watch the world from their shelf by the window.  An extra large 
; treat of tuna in the evening eased their disappointment.  Today 
; is looking like it will be another blustery one.  The duo is 
; braced for more disappointment.
; 
; For me it looks like an average day coming up.  But sometimes 
; average days can be quite interesting.  Check back in 24 hours 
; to see if anything of interest appears in before then.  Until 
; next FOTD, take care, and if only we knew which path is the 
; right one.
