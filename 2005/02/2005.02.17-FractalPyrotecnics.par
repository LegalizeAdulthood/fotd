; FOTD -- February 17, 2005 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us one final time to the parent fractal 
; that is based on variations of the real cube-root of -2.  The 
; visit has most certainly been productive, but the time has come 
; to move on to new vistas.
; 
; I named today's image "Fractal Pyrotechnics".  The gaudy and 
; perhaps overly intense colors remind me of a display of fire-
; works.  The scene is located very near that of yesterday's 
; image, though it is not 'evaporated', and lies not quite so 
; deep in the parent valley.
; 
; The rating of an 8 seems appropriate for such a brilliant scene. 
; This rating might be a bit exaggerated, but I also might have a 
; tendency to under-rate my images, so the rating of an 8 will 
; remain.
; 
; To assure that the image renders at the correct magnitude, I 
; have inserted the mathtolerance entry into the parameter file.  
; This entry forces the program to continue calculating even beyond 
; the limit of total precision, but it must be cleared from the en-
; vironment to enable the program to switch to arbitrary precision 
; math when this is available and needed.
; 
; The render time of 33 minutes is a bit on the slow side, but the 
; wait may be avoided by downloading the completed image from the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The time for the next installment of philosophy, when one of two 
; extremes could happen, is but a few days off.  At that time, 
; depending on the opinion of the reader, either the secrets of 
; the universe will be revealed, or I will show myself to be 
; totally mistaken.  It is most unlikely that I will solve a 
; puzzle which, for thousands of years, men greater than myself 
; have been unable to solve.  It is equally unlikely that every 
; thing I say will be totally incorrect.
; 
; The best I can hope for is that those who claim I am mistaken 
; will point out and correct my mistakes, and not simply disagree 
; because my opinion conflicts with their world-view.  The outcome 
; will be, as it always is, a continuation of the puzzle, but it's 
; still fun to speculate, and I excel at speculation, so don't go 
; anywhere.
; 
; Wednesday morning was sunny and warm, with a temperature of 63F 
; 17C, but clouds moved in shortly after noon and a rain squall 
; struck an hour later, dropping the temperature to 48F 9C.  An 
; extra treat of tuna was needed to ease the fractal cats' disap-
; pointment.  Today is starting with hazy sun and midwinter cold.  
; The duo seems doomed to more disappointment.
; 
; For me it looks like the usual day coming up, meaning finish the 
; commercial work and see what waits in fractal land.  It's a good 
; thing I got my life long ago.  I have no idea where I could find 
; one now that fractals have arrived.  I have no idea where I'll 
; find the next FOTD image either, but for some reason, the images 
; always seem to be there when I go searching.  Until the next 
; FOTD appears in 24 hours, take care, and be happy when the day's 
; work is finished.
