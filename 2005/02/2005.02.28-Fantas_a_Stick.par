; ---------
; 
; FOTD -- February 28, 2005 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After the two highest rated consecutive FOTD fractals of all 
; time, today's image, with its rating of an impressive 8, 
; actually seems disappointing.  But a rating of 8 is still much 
; above average, and today's image must be given the recognition 
; it deserves.
; 
; The image is an evaporated scene in the fractal that results 
; when 4 negative portions of Z^(-1.4) are combined with 0.4 
; negative portion of Z^(-14) before (1/C) is added.
; 
; Evaporated fractals, like the physical vacuum, are not as empty 
; as they first appear.  The physical vacuum, though it contains 
; no matter, is still filled with energy fields, which can be seen 
; as an exchange of quantum particles; an evaporated fractal, 
; though it contains no visible escaping points, is still filled 
; with trapped points whose activity can be revealed by an inside 
; fill such as the 'bof61' fill that in today's image makes the 
; invisible visible.
; 
; I gave today's image the nonsense name "Fantas-a-Stick".  The 
; reason for such a name is that I felt like doing it.  The render 
; time of under 3 minutes continues the recent trend of showing 
; that great fractals do not necessarily need to be unbearably 
; slow.
; 
; Curiously enough, the fractal lady, who has often commented that 
; I under-rate my fractals, and remarks that I never give a rating 
; of 10, now tells me that I have over-rated the fractals of the 
; past two days, which I did rate at a 10, implying that I don't 
; know the value of my own fractals, and presumably anyone else's, 
; fractals.  I think she would like to see me spend a bit less 
; time in fractal land and a bit more time in 'real' land.  But if 
; I don't find these images, who will?
; 
; No one will.  And the world is already filled with those who, 
; unlike myself, totally ignore the world of fractals.  What 
; difference would it make if I added myself to the multitude who 
; ignore fractals?
; 
; Today's image may be viewed by running the included parameter 
; file or by downloading the finished GIF image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Lots of sun and a temperature of 37F 3C gave the cats ample time 
; Sunday in the holly thicket at the bottom of the yard.  They 
; would have preferred it a little warmer, but seemed satisfied 
; with what they had.  Only the normal serving of tuna was needed. 
; This morning I see snow in the forecast, but no snow in the air. 
; Could our weather 'experts' once again be wrong?  The duo seems 
; unconcerned.  Maybe they know something the experts don't.
; 
; The work for me is light, and I'm on a fractal hot streak.  How 
; long can the good luck last?  Tomorrow's FOTD is but 24 hours 
; away.  Until then, take care, and a fractal a day keeps one 
; healthy, maybe not wealthy, but certainly wise.
