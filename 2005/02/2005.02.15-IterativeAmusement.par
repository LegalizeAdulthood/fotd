; FOTD -- February 15, 2005 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To add a bit of variety to today's adventure, I changed the 
; portions of Z in the parent fractal that I have been exploring 
; for a week.  Instead of positive portions, we now have negative 
; portions.  This change creates an even more interesting fractal.
; 
; Yesterday's image turned out so well that I tried the same 
; partial-evaporation trick again today.  I rendered the scene 
; with the inside set to 'bof61' and the outside set to 'tdis'.  
; The resulting image rates another 9.
; 
; I found today's scene in a part of the parent fractal shaped 
; like a fan.  There are many more unusual features in this new 
; parent fractal, which I will be exploring for a few more days 
; before moving on to something entirely new.
; 
; Much of the purpose of fractals is simply amusement.  This is 
; the reason I named today's image "Iterative Amusement".  The 
; relatively fast render time of 3-1/2 minutes makes the image 
; that much more amusing.  The image may be seen in even less 
; time by downloading it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; It rained all day Monday here at Fractal Central, keeping the 
; fractal cats safely confined to their indoor shelf by the win-
; dow.  They had one thrilling moment when a squirrel carelessly 
; climbed onto the ledge outside the glass, and they both sprang 
; to the attack.  When the squirrel saw two cats eyeing him, he 
; took off like a bat out of you-know-where.  Today is starting 
; cloudy, but it is milder, and promises to be far more pleasant, 
; both for the squirrel and the dynamic duo.
; 
; For me, it will be a satisfactory day if I end it with no work 
; piled up.  The philosophy is still a couple days off, but the 
; next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; think kindly of your amusing fractals.
