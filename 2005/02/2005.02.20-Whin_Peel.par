; FOTD -- February 20, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In the 'Basically' image of two days ago we saw what happens to 
; midgets on the main stem of the Mandelbrot set when they are 
; very close to being swallowed up behind the bailout radius.  In 
; today's image I checked to see what would happen to a midget on 
; the northern filament when it is about to be swallowed up.
; 
; I reduced the bailout to 2, a setting that cuts off the extremi-
; ties of the M-set, and zoomed in on the point where the eastern 
; branch of the northern filament vanishes behind the shrinking 
; bailout radius.  I chose the closest midget to the cut-off point 
; that I could find.  The midget is a very small one, requiring a 
; magnitude that borders on the arbitrary-precision range.  I have 
; entered the mathtolerance=/0 into the parameter file to be cer-
; tain that the more accurate math is used in the rendering.  This 
; slows the image somewhat, but the render time of 7-1/2 minutes 
; is still quite reasonable.
; 
; The overall effect is much the same as what we saw in the 
; 'Basically' image, though the radiating filaments zig-zag, in 
; comparison to the earlier image, where the filaments are 
; straight.
; 
; The earlier image worked best when the outside was set to 
; 'summ'.  Today's image works best however with the outside set 
; to 'tdis'.  I had hoped for something a bit better from the 
; day's adventure, and my disappointment shows in the image 
; rating, which has dropped to a 6.  The name "Whin Peel" is a 
; variation of the word 'pinwheel'.
; 
; Things could be worse; a rating of 6 is still above average.  
; And the 7 minutes spent in rendering can be saved by downloading 
; the completed GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Despite ample sun, the temperature stayed below freezing all day 
; here at Fractal Central on Saturday.  The fractal cats, whose 
; delicate ears are subject to frostbite, waited until late after-
; noon before asking to go out, and then strayed no farther than 6 
; feet from the back door.  20 minutes later, when they were warm 
; again inside, Tippy brought up the topic of tuna, and Thomas 
; agreed.  Today is starting almost as cold, and in addition the 
; clouds are increasing with heavy snow forecast by evening.  I 
; doubt that the duo will have a good day.
; 
; The philosophy will appear in a few days.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours or so.  Until then, take care, and don't get 
; overrun by a hit-and-run fractal.
