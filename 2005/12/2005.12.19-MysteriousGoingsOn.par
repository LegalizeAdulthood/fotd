; FOTD -- December 20, 2005 (Rating NONE)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is not much to look at, but it holds deep math-
; ematical mysteries.  The iterated formula is Z^2+C, but the 
; image is neither a Julia set nor a perturbed Mandelbrot set.  It 
; is a simple slice in the Oblate direction through the center of 
; the large bud centered at -1 on the X-axis of the classic Mandel-
; brot set.  The real(c) value of every point of the image is -1, 
; while the imag(z) value is zero.  It is one of the most familiar 
; slices of the Z^2+C Julibrot.
; 
; Since the image is so familiar and I put almost no effort into 
; coloring it, rating it according to the usual standards would be 
; unfair.  I chose to leave the image unrated and concentrate 
; instead on the mathematics, which at least to me is a mystery.
; 
; The number 1.618... is known as the golden ratio, or just the 
; greek letter 'phi'.  This number has the property of showing up 
; in the most unexpected places, not the least of which is the 
; Z^2+C Julibrot.  It appears very prominently in several forms in 
; today's image.
; 
; To start, the limit of today's fractal on the X-axis is exactly 
; + and - 1.618... .  Next, the two sets of most prominent arms 
; meet at + and - 0.618... on the X-axis, a value which is the 
; reciprocal of 'phi'.  In addition, the pair of arms beyond these 
; meet at + and - 1.272..., which happens to be the square root of 
; 'phi'.  The next pair of arms meet at -1.507..., which is the 
; square root of 1+(sqrt(phi)).  I assume the series of signifi-
; cant numbers continues through the entire set of ever smaller 
; arms, though I have not attempted to track them.
; 
; I named the image "Mysterious Goings-On" because of the unexpec-
; ted numbers that appear in it.  I assume that a math expert 
; could easily supply a simple reason for this apparent mystery, 
; but unfortunately I am no math expert.
; 
; The render time of today's image is no mystery.  It is one of 
; the fastest FOTD images of all time.  At a superluminal 2-1/4 
; seconds, it will try no one's patience.  Those with over-quali-
; fied, handicapped computers may grow a bit impatient with their 
; machines, but the completed GIF image is posted as always on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; from where it may swiftly be downloaded.
; 
; A bit of philosophy is brewing, but is not yet ready to be made 
; public.  Stay tuned.
; 
; Limited sunshine and cold temperatures kept the fractal cats 
; safely indoors here at Fractal Central on Monday.  But they 
; appear to have been spoiled by my sister, who gave them all the 
; tuna they could eat as she looked after them over the weekend, 
; while we were away.  It's no problem.  I am not fooled by their 
; guilt-inducing sulky stares.  My day was moderately busy; the 
; fractal was moderately successful.  The next fractal will appear 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take much care, and remember that 
; things are almost always better elsewhere.
