; FOTD -- December 15, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal image shows something new in the fractal created 
; by the formula Z^2+C.  The Mandelbrot set and the Julia sets are 
; familiar enough, but what about the images such as today's, 
; which result when the planes of the Julibrot determined by the 
; imag(z) and real(c) axes are examined?
; 
; I have named this orientation the Elliptic.  The images it holds 
; are a blending of the Mandelbrot set and the Julia sets, though 
; some of them, such as today's, bear little resemblance to either.
; 
; Today's scene is located in the East Valley area of the M-set, 
; and also in a small part of many of the corresponding Julia 
; sets.  I have named it "Something New" because it would take a 
; long search to find anything even remotely like it in any of the 
; pure M- or J-sets.
; 
; But uniqueness does not necessarily make a great fractal, and 
; after careful consideration, today's image could be rated no 
; higher than a 5.
; 
; The render time of 6-1/2 minutes may be overcome by downloading 
; the completed GIF image from the FOTD web site at:

; 
; Thursday was one of those totally hopeless days for the dynamic 
; cat duo.  A very cold and cloudy morning led to snow by noon and 
; freezing rain by 3pm.  At night dense fog moved in.  The fractal 
; duo spent the day alternating between watching the weather from 
; their window shelf and sleeping on the couch.  A good deal of 
; tuna was needed in the evening to cheer them up.  My day was 
; nominal and even a bit slippery at times.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and wax philosophi-
; cal, whoever he is.
