; FOTD -- December 14, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image returns us to the most prolific fractal of all -- 
; the one and only original Mandelbrot set.  We focus on a small 
; filament on the northeast shoreline of a small midget in the 
; large north radical of the large midget on the negative X-axis 
; of the M-set, and dive very deep indeed to find the even-smaller 
; midget that appears at the center of today's image.
; 
; The name "Mandelbrot Berries" was inspired, (if any inspiration 
; was involved), by the eight vaguely berry-shaped features around 
; the tiny midget.
; 
; At the scale of today's image, the entire M-set would be near 
; the size of the Milky Way galaxy.  It's a good thing that 
; relativity does not come into play in the world of fractals, or 
; it would take many lifetimes to get from one side of this 
; bloated M-set to the other.
; 
; Because the M-set has been so thoroughly explored, I could rate 
; today's image no higher than a 6.  The magnitude is well into 
; the range where arbitrary precision math is needed, which means 
; the image is a slow one, taking exactly 4 seconds less than one 
; hour to calculate on my old slow machine.
; 
; But the hour can be saved by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the completed GIF image from there.
; 
; The skies were sunny here at Fractal Central on Monday, but the 
; ground remains snow-covered and the temperature never rose above 
; freezing.  As a result, the cats never got their noses beyond 
; the open doorway.  They spent the day on their shelf by the 
; window, watching the birds and trying to keep warm.  My day was 
; as average as a day can be.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours, which is also as average as can be.  Until then, take 
; care, and see the glow.
