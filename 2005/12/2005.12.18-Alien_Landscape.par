; FOTD -- December 19, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today, with the aid of the SliceJulibrot2 formula, we enter 
; 4-dimensional hyperspace.  Hyperspace is any space of more than 
; 3 dimensions.  I confine my investigations to 4-dimensional 
; hyperspace, which we can come the closest to visualizing with 
; our 3-dimensional brains.
; 
; The formula draws most slices of the 4-dimensional Z^2+C 
; Julibrot figure.  Being unable to visualize all possible 
; orientations in 4-D hyperspace, I will not claim the formula 
; draws every possible orientation, but I have not yet found a 
; slice that it cannot draw.
; 
; Today's slice is orientated close to the Parabolic direction, 
; but rotated 1/3 of the way toward the Elliptic direction.  As 
; should be evident from the elements that resemble goofy eyes, 
; the scene is located in the East Valley area of the Mandelbrot 
; set.
; 
; There are no 'inside' areas appearing in the image.  The area 
; that resembles a blue sky with patches of haze is actually 
; composed of very high iteration 'outside' stuff made more 
; interesting by being rendered with the outside=imag option.
; 
; The picture vaguely resembles a scene on an alien planet, which 
; is why I named it "Alien Landscape".  The rating of a 5 shows 
; that I am not thrilled with the result.  The render time of 
; 5-1/2 minutes is fair enough.  Rendering may be totally 
; eliminated by downloading the finished image from the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The report is that the weather was uneventful at Fractal Central 
; while we were away over the week-end.  The ice-storm stayed well 
; out of our way to the west and south.  We found one possible 
; home for the new Fractal Central, but it has problems that would 
; need to be worked out.  My sister reports that the fractal cats 
; seemed unconcerned that fractal lady and I were gone for two 
; days, though they were concerned that their accustomed tuna, 
; might not be served on time.  They also demanded that they be 
; allowed to check the weather for themselves.  The next FOTD will 
; likely appear in 24 hours.  (I will no longer say certainly.)  
; Until then, take care, and not even the appearance of the FOTD 
; fractals, is absolutely certain.
