; FOTD -- May 01, 2005 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is another one created by the Mystic2 formula.  
; The brilliant green horizontal line across the lower part of the 
; frame is the actual edge of the radius-1 circle.  All above that 
; line is 'bof61' inside fill; all below it is normal outside 
; equal-iteration bands.
; 
; I named the image "Armageddon Arrives".  In religious mythology 
; Armageddon refers to the final decisive battle between the 
; forces of good and evil.  Obviously, this battle has not yet 
; taken place, for the world is still filled with both good and 
; evil, but from what I hear, the battle is not far off.  In one 
; sense, the battle is un-necessary, since it is pre-determined 
; that the forces of good will emerge victorious.  I guess the 
; battle is kind of a symbolic thing, a ritual that has been 
; foretold for so long that it must be permitted to come to pass.  
; The forces of good would be sorely disappointed if they were 
; deprived of their battle and their victory over evil.
; 
; Luckily, fractals are neither good nor evil.  They simply *are*. 
; Today's fractal reminds me of a huge explosion in a devastated 
; landscape, which is the reason I gave it its name.  Since I am a 
; peaceable man who does not enjoy war and suffering, I could give 
; the image a rating no higher than a below-average 4.  The render 
; time of well over 7 minutes may be bypassed by downloading the 
; finished image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; It's too bad that the battle can't be bypassed also.
; 
; With a temperature of 61F 16C, Saturday was mild enough here 
; at Fractal Central, but the rain and showers lasted all day, 
; limiting the outdoor adventure of the fractal cats to 20 minutes 
; on the porch.  An extra serving of tuna was needed in the 
; evening to restore their acceptable dispositions.  Today is 
; starting a little better.  I expect better things from the duo.  
; As for me, I have little planned except for the fractals.  The 
; next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; don't be impatient for the end.  As far as I can tell, it is not 
; as close as some would claim.
