; FOTD -- May 24, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Baleen".  Baleen is the bony material, 
; better known as whalebone, that baleen whales have hanging in 
; their mouth.  It acts as a filter to collect the tiny organisms 
; on which they feed.  Baleen was also used as corset stays to 
; give the ladies their waspish waists when wasp-waists were in 
; fashion.  I am not sure what baleen has to do with math and 
; fractals, but for some strange reason I thought of it when I saw 
; today's image.
; 
; The scene is once again the East Valley of the large midget on 
; the main stem of an almost-Mandelbrot set, with the difference 
; being that we are no longer at ground level of the logarithmic 
; hyperspiral.  At this level, the same effect of an explosion in 
; a railroad switching yard is there, though some subtle changes 
; have appeared.
; 
; The image is striking enough to earn a rating of a 7.  The 
; render time of 11 minutes (on my machine) is not strikingly 
; short, but the minor delay may be avoided by downloading the 
; pre-rendered GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The rain threatened on Monday here at Fractal Central, but it 
; never arrived.  The temperature reached a mild 66F 19C.  This 
; is chilly when compared to the normal 77F 25C, but the fractal 
; cats didn't mind.  They spent several hours in the yard, happily 
; watching the birds fly by.  This morning is starting cloudy and 
; quite chilly, with the rain finally in progress.  We'll have to 
; see what the cats do about it.
; 
; For me it's business work first and fractal play second.  The 
; next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; if a four-dimensional planet existed, it could rotate in two 
; different directions at the same time.
