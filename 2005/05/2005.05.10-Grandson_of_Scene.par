; FOTD -- May 10, 2005 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Has the FOTD 'jumped the shark'?  Jumping the shark refers to 
; the outstanding event in a great series that marks the start of 
; the decline in quality that leads inevitably to the end of the 
; series.  The past few weeks have hardly seen great FOTD's.  The 
; images have been ho-hum.  The discussions have been terse and 
; have merely repeated what everyone already knows.  The philoso-
; phy is still brewing, but seems stuck in some grey nether land.  
; There has been no outstanding event, but I must keep careful 
; watch over this trend.
; 
; Today's image is a close-up of the midget that appeared at the 
; center of yesterday's 'Son of Scene' image.  What name could be 
; more appropriate than "Grandson of Scene"?  Three consecutive 
; visits to the same point in the world of fractals really is a 
; bit too much.  I could therefore rate the image no higher than a 
; lowly 4.  To make matters worse, the render time of 55 minutes 
; is well into the slow range.
; 
; With its broken arcs, diffuse shorelines, and small crooked 
; buds, the midget is about what would be expected in a fractal of 
; order 1.5.  The magnitude of almost 6x10^11 is high enough that 
; I included the mathtolerance entry in the parameter file to be 
; certain that the image renders at the correct size.
; 
; The best way to avoid rendering problems is to download the pre-
; rendered GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Monday's weather was the best so far this spring here at Fractal 
; Central.  Absolutely clear skies, gentle winds, and a tempera-
; ture of 77F 25C were just what the fractal cats were waiting 
; for.  The 9 hours they spent in the yard set a new record for 
; time outdoors in a single day.  Today is starting with more blue 
; skies and warmer temperatures, it looks to be another great cat 
; day.  For me it looks like just another workday.  The next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if life 
; serves you a watermelon, spit out the seeds.
