; FOTD -- May 22, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In yesterday's discussion I said that today I would investigate 
; the Julia orientation of the 'Miracle' fractal that appeared on 
; May 17.  I am in the process of investigating it, but so far I 
; have found nothing worthy of FOTD status, (which itself is not 
; that high).  I will do further investigation later today.  Who 
; knows, I might even surprise myself.
; 
; Instead of revealing a Julia 'Miracle', today's image takes us 
; to one of my favorite places in all of fractal land -- the east 
; valley of the large midget on the infinitely divided main stem 
; of the Z^2.003+C Mandeloid.  This is the area that holds the 
; mysterious Julia rectangle that I keep returning to, though in 
; today's image we are in the Mandelbrot orientation.
; 
; For some unknown reason I named the image "Hotfoot".  Actually 
; it looks more like a rail yard designed by a maniac.  The colors 
; are very intense, perhaps a bit too intense for the otherwise 
; un-exceptional scene.  Regardless, I have rated the image at an 
; above-average 7.
; 
; The render time of just under 5 minutes on my 10-year-old compu-
; ter will be reduced to 1 minute or so on the fastest machines.  
; But it is still fun to visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download the completed GIF image from there.
; 
; Near ideal weather on Saturday had a great effect on the fractal 
; cats.  They spent several hours lounging in the yard doing 
; nothing, which is what cats do best.  My day would have been 
; better if I had not needed to trim the grass in the afternoon.  
; This morning is starting about the same.  I expect more of the 
; same from the cat duo.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and look for improvement.
