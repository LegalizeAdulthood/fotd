; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In the past I have several times been asked if I believe in 
; miracles.  The answer depends on the definition of the word 
; 'miracle'.  If a miracle is seen as a violation of natural laws 
; brought about by the intervention of a supernatural deity, then 
; I do not believe in miracles.  True, many things take place that 
; defy natural explanation, but these events are merely things 
; that are not yet understood.  They ultimately will be explained 
; and then be seen to fit into the natural scheme of things, which 
; will expand to include them.
; 
; If a miracle is taken to be an event so unlikely as to be almost 
; impossible, then yes, I do believe in miracles.  People who 
; desperately need money sometimes do win lotteries.  A miracle of 
; the latter variety appears in today's image.
; 
; On the surface, the parent fractal of today's image is a Mandel-
; brot set.  But the exponent of Z is 2.000001 instead of 2, which 
; means it is not exactly a Mandelbrot set, but merely a very 
; close approximation.  One must search deep to find the tiny 
; differences, but when they are found, they are so unexpected as 
; to be a virtual miracle.
; 
; Today's image lies deep in East Valley of the large midget on 
; the main stem of the almost-M-set.  It is so unlike anything in 
; the true M-set that it must be considered a miracle, which is 
; why I named it "The Miracle".  The rating of a 9 may in fact be 
; a bit conservative, but I am very hesitant about giving today's 
; fractal a rating of 10, especially when I have not yet taken 
; today's line of investigation to its limit, and do not yet know 
; what I might find when I do.
; 
; I could have used the manzpower formula to draw today's image, 
; but that formula takes 12-1/2 minutes to finish the rendering.  
; The MandelbrotN formula finishes in only 9 minutes, so this is 
; the formula I used.  Of course, rendering may be totally avoided 
; by downloading the finished image from Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The fractal cats were happy on Monday when the sun shone and the 
; temperature reached 72F 22C.  This morning is starting cooler 
; with a mixture of sun and clouds.  Hopefully, the duo will be 
; happy again.  I'll be happy when the work is behind me.  Until 
; next FOTD, take care, and where will we go from here.
