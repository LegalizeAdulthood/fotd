; FOTD -- May 28, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The recipe for today's image is a simple mixture of Z^3 and Z^5, 
; with a little C added for flavor.  The result is a scattering of 
; fractals, the largest of which has open areas with four lobes 
; strung along its main stem, which in this case points north.  
; These open areas have tiny straight filaments radiating from 
; them.  I checked a filament radiating from one of the very small 
; open areas near the tip of the stem, and found today's fractal.
; 
; The midget at the center is standard enough.  The nearly-
; straight star-studded filaments radiating from it are what makes 
; the image worth being declared FOTD for May 28.  Actually, with 
; a rating of only an average 5, the image kind of sneaks onto the 
; honor roll by the skin of its teeth, but even a 5-rated fractal 
; is worth 3 minutes spent in calculating it.
; 
; As I tried to think of a name for the image, many cute and artsy 
; phrases came to mind and were quickly discarded.  I finally 
; settled on the name "Fractal Friday" in honor of the day on 
; which I found the image.  I realize that the image will not be 
; posted until Saturday, and not seen by some until Sunday, but 
; the 'Friday' name is the one the image will forever bear.
; 
; There are two ways of seeing the Friday fractal: first, by 
; running the included parameter file and waiting a few minutes; 
; second, by downloading the completed image from the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Lots of sun, gentle breezes, and a temperature of 81F 27C made 
; Friday a perfect day for the fractal cats, who spent over 6 
; hours in the yard.  Today is starting much the same, but I see 
; showers in the forecast for later today.  For me the day looks 
; very slow, which is the way I like it.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be lively.
