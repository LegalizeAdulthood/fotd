; FOTD -- May 15, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's FOTD we continue rotating a near-Mandelbrot set to 
; see what happens when its various parts cross the big split on 
; the negative real axis.
; 
; We have gone only 7500 levels up the spiral, to a point where 
; the big split intersects the south branch of Seahorse Valley.  
; What we have found there is a midget with the typical Seahorse 
; Valley features, but with those features broken and re-arranged.
; 
; I have named the image "Alternate Reality".  Alternate realities 
; are currently quite fashionable among the popular-scientific 
; set, and I might as well go along with the trend of the times.  
; And who knows?  There really might be an infinity of myselves in 
; nearby but invisible universes, becoming world famous by finding 
; the greatest fractals of all time and showing how the fractals 
; are the solution to the search for the theory of *almost* every-
; thing.  Maybe an infinity of myselves have actually managed to 
; include self-awareness in the theory and solved a theory of 
; *actually* everything.  What I keep wondering is, are these 
; alternate-reality fractal geniuses really me or merely others 
; who just happen to look like me?
; 
; Today's image will solve no theories of anything, but it managed 
; to earn a rating of 6.  The render time of 1/2-hour is a bit too 
; high a price to pay for such an image, so I advise downloading 
; the finished product from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a high temperature of 83F 28C, and with full sun, Saturday 
; turned out to be unexpectedly pleasant here at Fractal Central.  
; The two Fractal Central cats made the most of things by spending 
; the entire afternoon in the yard.  The weather grew threatening 
; in the evening, when thunder started rumbling, but by the time 
; the rain arrived, the cats were safely inside.  Today is start-
; ing much the same, with showers again forecast.  The next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if your 
; fractal seems corny, shuck it.
