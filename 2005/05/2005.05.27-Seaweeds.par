; FOTD -- May 27, 2005 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Fractals are not only infinite in complexity, they can be 
; infinite in size as well.  The parent fractal of today's image 
; is one of these doubly infinite fractals.  I am not sure if it 
; is truly infinite in size, but it shows no signs of coming to 
; an end at the maximum outzoom of which Fractint is capable.
; 
; I once thought that such super-sized parent fractals would 
; permit a greater degree of magnification to be attained.  I 
; wrote a formula something like 0.000001*(Z^2)+C, in the 
; expectation that the very deep features of the M-set, which are 
; normally beyond resolution, would be enlarged into the range of 
; resolution.  Alas, I was wrong.  My trick did not increase the 
; degree of magnification that was possible, it merely shifted the 
; decimal point.  Of course, when arbitrary precision math became 
; available, such tricks were no longer necessary, at least for 
; the M-set.
; 
; Today's image, which is located in one of the more unlikely 
; areas of its parent, is named "Seaweeds".  I gave it that name 
; because with all its letters in a cluster on the keyboard, the 
; word is fun to type.  And the green stripes surrounding the 
; midget do remind me of strips of seaweed drifting in the current.
; 
; The rating of an 8 might be a bit liberal, especially consider-
; ing the slow render time of over 1/2 hour.  But then the FOTD 
; rating represents what I consider an image to be worth at the 
; time I rate it, not what someone else thinks of the same image a 
; few days later.

; 
; Only a few too many clouds kept Thursday from being absolutely 
; perfect here at F.C.  The high temperature of 75F 24C was ideal 
; for the cats, and the light winds let the slightest sound of 
; danger be clearly audible.  The duo enjoyed 7 hours in the holly 
; thicket, and even then needed to be coaxed inside with a can of 
; tuna.  Today is starting much the same.  If nothing goes wrong, 
; the cats will be happy again.
; 
; As for me, I'll be happy when the work is behind me and an even 
; better fractal before me.  That fractal, if it happens, will 
; appear in 24 hours as the next FOTD.  Until then, take care, and 
; walk in harmony.
