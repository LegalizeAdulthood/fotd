; FOTD -- May 31, 2005 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To produce today's fractal, the last of the month of May, I took 
; some Z^3 and subtracted 0.2 parts of Z^5 from it (more or less), 
; then added plain C to produce a parent fractal filled with bits 
; and pieces of baby Mandeloids of many different orders.  
; Forgetting the odd orders, I focused on a quadratic midget.
; 
; The parameters of today's image are quite critical.  Even a 
; small change of any parameter changes the image to a totally 
; blank screen.  The overall appearance is that of a midget in an 
; East Valley, but I have never seen an East Valley midget quite 
; like today's, with its totally disconnected bug-eyes.
; 
; I spent nearly an hour on the coloring, which is an unusually 
; long time and resulted in an unusually smooth GIF image for one 
; consisting of flat bands.  The colors raise the rating from a 7 
; to an 8.  The name "Many Layers" was originally intended for 
; another image in the same parent fractal, an image that was 
; discarded when I found today's.
; 
; The render time of just over 2 minutes is quite reasonable for a 
; fractal of above average quality.  The image download from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; is also available.
; 
; The sun shone until 3pm on Monday, and the temperature rose to 
; 79F 26C.  But then the sun was obscured by a shower cloud.  The 
; rain was light, but it spoiled the cats' day in the yard, making 
; an extra tuna treat necessary in the evening to restore their 
; good spirits.  Tuna almost always works.  The cats can tell it's 
; coming by the sound of the can being opened, and as soon as they 
; hear it, they start purring and rubbing against everything in 
; sight.  Today is starting great.  No more tuna will be needed.
; 
; For me it's back to work.  The holiday, for what it was worth, 
; is over.  The next in the endless series of intriguing but other-
; wise useless fractals will appear right here in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and if science says it's so, it must be so.
