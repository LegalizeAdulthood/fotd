; FOTD -- April 26, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal takes us into the wilderness created by the 
; formula Z^(1.5)+C, where we investigate a valley with a tiny 
; midget in it.  The name "Ace and a Half" refers to the exponent 
; of Z.  All in all it's an average fractal, perhaps with a bit 
; more delicate feathery detail than usual, but still worth no 
; more than a rating of 5.  The render time of over 24 minutes is 
; a bit excessive for such an average image, so the better choice 
; may be to download the completed GIF image from the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; My philosophical thoughts continue, but are unorganized.  Right 
; now, I am wondering exactly what is meant by statements such as 
; 'the present state of the universe' or 'at the present time, the 
; universe is 15-billion years old'.  Relativity shows that there 
; is no such thing as a present moment of time that exists through-
; out the universe, since everything in it is in relative motion.  
; Are different parts of the universe a different age even though 
; they all supposedly started at the same time in the same 'big 
; bang' event?  Are we seeing the 'twin paradox' in action?  Per-
; haps the whole concept of a universe is a fantasy we invented to 
; squeeze things down to a level that is somewhat intuitive.  I'll 
; do some pondering on this situation in the days to come.
; 
; The weather here at fractal headquarters on Monday was partly 
; cloudy, but the high temperature of 63F 17C was a bit chilly and 
; the brisk wind increased the chill.  Seeing these conditions, 
; the intrepid cat duo ventured bravely forth into the yard.  They 
; met with little excitement there, and were quite satisfied when 
; they returned to civilization an hour later.  My day was satis-
; factorily busy, with the philosophy progressing slowly.
; 
; Today is starting sunny, but clouds and rain are due by evening.  
; Hopefully, the cats will finish their adventure early.  The next 
; FOTD is due in 24 hours, and the chance of it appearing at that 
; time is almost certain.  Until then, take care, and what time 
; is it?
