; FOTD -- April 24, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "What's up Doctor?".  This has nothing to 
; do with a certain well-known rabbit.  I simply gave it that name 
; because these words were the first to come to mind when I saw 
; the image.  (Sometimes I like to leave the room while fast 
; fractals are rendering, and give myself a surprise when I 
; return.)  And let's face it, the image is unusual enough to 
; justify the name.
; 
; The parent fractal, which combines negative portions of Z^(-1.5) 
; and Z^(-3.5), then adds (1/C), is one of those huge sprawling 
; affairs that needs an outzoom before it fits onto the screen.  
; Today's scene is found in the vicinity of a valley, which the 
; parent fractal has many of.  Surprisingly, the image was 
; rendered with the outside set to the ancient setting of 'iter'.  
; (No one uses that setting nowadays.  We have long ago seen all 
; it has to offer, and far better things are available.)
; 
; The image is good enough to earn its rating of 7.  Its render 
; time of 2-1/2 minutes can be cut to 1-1/2 minutes by switching 
; the passes to g.  And if all else fails, the image may be down-
; loaded from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Saturday turned out better than expected here at Fractal 
; Central, with ample afternoon sun and a high temperature of 72F 
; 22C.  True, a thunder-storm moved in at 6pm, with wind, heavy 
; rain, pea-sized hail and crackling lightning, but by then the 
; cats had completed their daily adventure in the outdoors, and 
; had taken shelter in the large closet.  This morning is starting 
; sunny but quite a bit cooler.  It should be good enough for the 
; duo.
; 
; A book arrived in the mail yesterday, "The Road to Reality" by 
; Penrose, which looks quite interesting.  I think I'll give it a 
; quick read (if possible) before continuing with my speculative 
; philosophy.  There might be something in it that will change one 
; of my opinions.  The next FOTD fractal will appear 24 hours from 
; now.  Until then, take care, and maybe the reason we can't find 
; reality is because nothing is real.
