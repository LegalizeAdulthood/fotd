; FOTD -- April 27, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the northwest shoreline of the main 
; bay of the Mandelbrot set, where we find a midget buried in an 
; area of chaos.  We then go deep into the East Valley of this 
; midget, where we find a much smaller midget.  This smaller 
; midget lies unresolved at the center of today's image, which I 
; have named "Purple Shadows" for no obvious reason.
; 
; The rating of a 5 indicates that I consider the fractal to be 
; average.  The render time of under 3 minutes is within reason.  
; As has been the case for quite a few years, the completed image 
; is available for download on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; While skimming the thousand-page book "Road to Reality" that I 
; recently purchased, I came upon a passage where Roger Penrose, 
; the author, expresses his opinion that the much vaunted 'theory 
; of everything' (except the mind) could very well be a pipe 
; dream.  He suspects that multi-dimensional strings and mem-
; branes, though interesting, are just another dead end.  He specu-
; lates that, before we can find a true theory of everything, we 
; will have to find a way to include the conscious mind in it.
; 
; This is basically my own opinion also.  Before we will ever 
; solve the big questions of philosophy, we will need to surrender 
; our old view of a world filled with objects out there, separate 
; from ourselves, which we observe from inside our bodies.  This 
; view gives us a feeling of security about the foundation of our 
; science, but it just ain't so.  What do I have to replace this 
; classic world view?  That is the question.
; 
; The skies remained mostly sunny most all day Tuesday here at 
; Fractal Central, which let the temperature reach a high of 70F 
; 21C.  But the wind blew quite briskly during the afternoon, 
; holding the fractal cats' outdoor time to under an hour.  Their 
; disappointment made a trip to the tuna closet necessary.  Today 
; is starting partly cloudy.  The cats' day will likely be better. 
; For me, the work is moderate and the fractals are numerous.  
; Until next FOTD, take care, and the universe is *how* old?
