; FOTD -- April 21, 2005 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a midget, or an atom as they are sometimes 
; called, way out near the tip of the main stem of the Mandelbrot 
; set, in an area where the magnitude is greater than 2x10^41.  
; Though the magnitude is well into the range of arbitrary preci-
; sion math, the area being calculated is a fast one, and the 
; render time is cut in half by taking advantage of the X-axis 
; near-symmetry.  As a result, the image calculates in a surpri-
; sing 8-1/2 minutes on the P200, and less than one minute on the 
; P4-2300.  (Actually, the image is not totally symmetrical in 
; respect to the X-axis, though the difference is subtle.)
; 
; To rev up the image a bit, it was rendered with outside=summ.
; 
; The image impresses me as being a little above average for such 
; an over-explored area.  The rating of a 6 seems appropriate.
; 
; As has been the case for 8 years, the completed GIF image is 
; available for download on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The temperature rose to 88F 31C here at Fractal Central on 
; Wednesday.  The cats found a shady spot in the holly thicket, 
; and stretched out for the afternoon.  Today is starting cloudy 
; and cooler, but still pleasantly mild.  The duo should find this 
; acceptable.  For me the real work is rather heavy, which means 
; I'll be busy into the late afternoon.  This will still leave 
; enough time to find a hopefully great fractal however.  That 
; fractal, great or otherwise, will appear in 24 hours as the next 
; FOTD.  Until then, take care, and look for your self.
