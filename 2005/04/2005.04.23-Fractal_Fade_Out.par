; FOTD -- April 23, 2005 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The most fun with today's image is not in the finished product 
; -- it is in the rendering.  The image was rendered with the 
; passes set to 'b', which traces the boundaries between areas of 
; different color.  This option does not work with many images, 
; because it traces around and misses disconnected features, but 
; it works quite well with today's image, where it goes merrily 
; along its way, tracing out a loosely connected shaft of dissipa-
; ting features.
; 
; The features are dissipating because they lie over a solid area 
; of 'outside' material with an iteration count around 660, and 
; they will be visible only if their iteration count is under this 
; figure.  The iteration count of the shaft increases from right 
; to left, and reaches the count of the background near the left 
; edge of the frame, where the shaft is totally absorbed.
; 
; The image was done in haste, and as a result can be rated no 
; higher than a 4.  I named it "Fractal Fade-Out" because the 
; shaft fades out as it moves from right to left across the 
; screen.  The render time of 5 minutes is worth the wait.  The 
; passes=b option is quite interesting to watch in action.
; 
; Those who would rather not render may download the already 
; rendered image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; In yesterday's FOTD I wrote that, unless something unexpected 
; happened, the next installment of philosophy would appear in 
; today's discussion.  Unfortunately, something unexpected (a load 
; of work) did happen, and the philosophy will not appear for 
; another day or two.
; 
; Heavy clouds, occasional light rain and a chilly temperature of 
; 50F 10C kept the fractal cats confined to the porch on Friday.  
; They were as happy as could be expected considering the condi-
; tions.  Today is starting cloudy and warmer, but with rain in 
; the forecast.  The cats will survive somehow.
; 
; I still have quite a bit of work to clear away before turning to 
; the land of fractals.  The next FOTD will appear in approximate-
; ly 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and fly with the eagles.
