; FOTD -- April 02, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; My mood is a bit serious this morning, so the discussion will be 
; terse.
; 
; Today's image must be seen as a diversion from the more serious 
; things presently happening in the world.  Though I am no longer 
; a Roman Catholic -- I simply cannot accept the church doctrines 
; -- I did attend eight years of Catholic elementary school and 
; still enjoy the impressive ceremonies of the Catholic church, 
; whose leader is dying.  When the present pope took office, I was 
; a young man, and now . . . well, I'm not exactly old, not yet at 
; least.  I still have many fractals left in me, but old age is 
; looking a lot more interesting.
; 
; The fractal for today is a curious midget that has existed 
; unseen for all eternity in the Elliptic orientation of the Z^2+C 
; Julibrot.  I named it "Fractal Comet" because it reminds me of a 
; sun-grazing comet whipping around the sun.  Considering that a 
; little over a week ago I posted a very similar image, the rating 
; of 5 is the best I could do for today's image.
; 
; The image is a mercifully fast one.  It renders in less than one 
; minute.  And it is also available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; At this point two paragraphs have been omitted from the Fractint 
; version of this discussion, but they appear in the philofractal 
; version.
; 
; The temperature reached 64F 18C and the rain held off until 
; after dark here at Fractal Central on Friday, allowing the 
; fractal cats a pleasant afternoon in the yard.  Their evening 
; indoors was just as pleasant.  But this morning is starting wet, 
; with the rain expected to continue through a good part of the 
; day.  I fear the good day will not be repeated.
; 
; I have just enough real work lined up to keep today from being a 
; day of total leisure.  The work comes first; the fractals come 
; later.  And the next fractal will come in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and think fractal thoughts.
