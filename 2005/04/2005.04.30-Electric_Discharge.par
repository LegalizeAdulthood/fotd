; FOTD -- April 30, 2005 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we return to the Mystic2 formula, a formula I 
; have not used in several years.  When used in the normal manner, 
; with the inside set to a flat color, this formula draws nothing 
; but empty circles of radius 1.  When an active inside fill is 
; used however, such as the 'bof61' of today's image, this formula 
; fills the empty circle with designs and patterns of the most 
; unpredictable nature.  The user-defined function included in the 
; formula simply increases the unpredictability.
; 
; I named today's image "Electric Discharge".  The zig-zag white 
; streaks, which resemble stylized lightning bolts, inspired the 
; name.  The rating of a 5 indicates that I consider the image to 
; be an average one.  The render time of just over one minute on 
; my 10-year-old machine is fast enough for all but the most 
; impatient.  Those with one of the new-fangled Fractint-
; challenged computers may need to download the image from the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; When I was a child, still in my wonder years, I wondered what 
; electricity is.  Now that I am a full-fledged grown-up, I see 
; that no one knows exactly what it is.  It's energy, sure enough, 
; and energy is the ability to do useful work, but somehow this 
; does not seem to answer the question of what it actually *is*.
; 
; Clouds and a chilly temperature of 59F 15C kept the fractal cats 
; within dashing distance of the porch all afternoon Friday.  But
; nothing happened to make them dash.  They ended the afternoon 
; with their noses in their food dishes.  Today is starting rainy, 
; with showers expected for most of the day.  The duo will not 
; like this.  For me, it's a moderate amount of work before I can 
; get to the fractals.  Tomorrow is a new day, a new month, and a 
; new fractal.  Until then, take care, and be sensible but don't 
; be a slave to common sense.
