; FOTD -- July 04, 2016 (Rating A-8, M-8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Welcome back to the latest incarnation of the FOTD, a real blast 
; from the past, when the art aspect of fractals, along with their 
; complex math, was the trendy thing among the intelligentsia of 
; the then modern world.  Those halcyon days are gone of course, 
; along with the final traces of my optimistic view of the world 
; and its burden of humanity.  But the abstract world of fractals 
; continues unchanged, and always will continue in its strange 
; state of semi-existence, even long after the planet has vanished 
; and no life remains in the heat-dead universe.
; 
; Due to recent world events and the poor outlook for the future, 
; my mood of cynical depression has grown stronger over the past 
; several weeks.  The fractals have been so few and far between 
; because I find it hard to write the FOTD discussion without 
; drifting into controversial, off-topic things such as religion, 
; philosophy, science and technology, mysticism, not to mention 
; politics.  And all of these would likely lead to debates on the 
; list that would be more appropriate elsewhere on the net.
; 
; Today's fractal, which I named "Mangled MandelMini" features a 
; mangled minibrot that is filled with strange fractal stuff 
; rather than being empty, as all proper mandel midgets should be. 
; The generating formula draws weird four-dimensional Mandelbrot 
; sets.  I'm not sure how the formula works, since today's 
; real(p4) parameter is so minute that it should have no effect.  
; But change this parameter to total zero and see how important 
; that infinitesimal one-googolth is to the appearance of the 
; central minibrot, which loses all its detail and can be made 
; into a flat black.
; 
; The art rates an 8, since I did put a little extra effort into 
; the image.  The math rates an 8.5 because of the mysteriously 
; great effect of the tiny real(p4) parameter.
; 
; The weather here at Fractal Central today was cloudy with 
; occasional rain, a most depressing Independence Day outcome.  
; The fractal cats spent most of the day watching for stray cats 
; and pigeons.  When a prowling tomcat leaped onto the outer 
; window sill, Nicholas sent it scampering for safety with one 
; mighty yell, startling even the two lady fractal cats.  FL spent 
; a half hour or so telling me I should develop a more positive 
; attitude, but was unable to give me any good reason to look for 
; a 'bright side'.
; 
; From the way it looks now, the next FOTD will be posted in a few 
; days.  Of course there is absolutely no guarantee.  Until 
; whenever, take care, and I'll cheer up when religion, science 
; and politics join together in one harmonious self-consistent 
; discipline that satisfies and brings peace to everyone on earth. 
; Now does anyone wish to tell me that I am not a dreamer?
