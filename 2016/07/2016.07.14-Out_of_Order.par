; FOTD -- July 14, 2016 (Rating A-8,M-9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is indeed out of order.  As can be seen in the X 
; and Y coordinates, it lies on the west shore line of the 
; northern branch of Scepter Valley of the classic Mandelbrot Set. 
; Its exact location is in the center of a minibrot.  But the 
; centers of minibrots are points of infinite iterations, so what 
; right does today's very non-blank scene have to be located 
; there?
; 
; This is the big mystery, in fact it is the greatest mystery I 
; have yet discovered in my 25 years or so of fractal exploration. 
; And what right does today's fractal have to contain an outer 
; ring of 20 elements and an inner ring of 22?  This is certainly 
; not a 'powers-of-two' series.  All I have is questions.  I have 
; no answers.
; 
; Do not try to reach a minibrot at the center of today's image.  
; There is none!  The whole scene is already inside a minibrot.  
; The number of elements continues increasing in steps of two as 
; we go deeper.  There might be something open at the center, 
; where increasing the maxiter will take us no deeper, but with my 
; 200mhz machine, I am not going to look for it.
; 
; The name "Out of Order" refers to the strange series of numbers 
; of elements around whatever if anything lies at the center of 
; today's image.  The art worth of the image is an 8, while the 
; math rates a 9.  The calculation time of a half-hour is true on 
; my ancient 200mhz unit.  On anything more modern, the image will 
; finish in a few minutes.  Curiously, if the outside is set to 
; 'TDIS' the image will take many times longer to finish.
; 
; I still wonder if the unexpected detail that makes up today's 
; image is a mere artifact of mathematical imprecision, or perhaps 
; a flaw in the HyperMandelbrot2 formula itself.  But whatever, 
; the images this formula draws can be very unexpected, and in a 
; week or so I'll probably have another one.
; 
; The weather was hot and humid here at Fractal Central today, 
; with a brief but very heavy shower at noon that dropped 2cm of 
; rain in 10 minutes but did nothing to cool things down.  The 
; afternoon high reached 93F 34C.  FL spent some afternoon time 
; repairing her garden where an overflowing rain gutter washed out 
; loose soil.  The fractal cats spent most of the day sleeping and 
; watching for unwanted cats, while I browsed the internet, where 
; materialists debate idealists over quantum interpretations.
; 
; The next FOT-'D' (I have returned to the traditional fot-'D' 
; name) will appear in a few days more or less.  Until that 
; wonderful time arrives, take care, and I see there is a kind of 
; undeclared war on the internet between the warriors of reason 
; who defend the classic Newtonian world view of material reality 
; and the insurgents who claim that quantum theory has shown that 
; the objective world of material is an unreal illusion.
; 
; I don't know which side is right, maybe both or neither; nor do 
; I care very much.  But the righteous rhetoric is amusing, with 
; materialistic rationalists vigorously disagreeing with some of 
; their own scientists who, by following the scientific method, 
; have come to conclusions that give credence to the philosophy of 
; idealism.
; 
; Actually, the battle could already be settled, since quantum 
; theory has been preaching metaphysics for 80 or 90 years, and 
; our hi-tech electronic devices, which have been using quantum 
; principles for almost as long, are still working as they should. 
; (In most cases, that is!)
; 
; More later . . .
