; FOTX -- June 15, 2016 (Rating A-6,M-6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The fractals have been coming slowly recently.  This does not 
; mean I am thinking of taking another year-long hiatus.  It means 
; that due to the current world situation, I have been busy on the 
; internet discussing, perhaps more accurately, arguing things 
; such as politics, religion, science, philosophy, etc.  And I am 
; most certainly not trying to stir up a heated debate on this 
; fractal list.  There are many more appropriate lists on which to 
; stir up trouble.  I simply want to express my own opinions, with 
; no claims of righteousness and no desire to debate.
; 
; In politics, I am not so certain that the U.S. is as innocent as 
; the mass media would have us believe.  Especially because a good 
; part of the rest of the world considers us the world's greatest 
; trouble makers.
; 
; In religion, I find it ironic that those of different faiths are 
; so often at each others' throats, arguing over trifles, when 
; none of them can offer the slightest hard evidence that anything 
; supernatural such as a god or a soul actually exists at all.
; 
; In science, I find it almost laughable that there are dozens of 
; so-called quantum interpretations still floating around and 
; being seriously debated.  The theory was worked out about ninety 
; years ago in Copenhagen by Bohr, Heisenberg etal. and it has 
; proved itself by working superbly ever since.
; 
; In philosophy, I find that after thousands of years, we are 
; still debating whether the world is real or merely a persistent 
; series of mental images.  And I wonder what difference it could 
; make.
; 
; I also find it annoying that skeptics trying to defend a 
; rational view of the world so often resort to childish 
; ad-hominem attacks against those with irrational views.  Come on 
; guys, to me you look like a desperate high school debating team 
; on the verge of losing a debate.
; 
; In fractals, I have found a scene deep in the main spike area of 
; a Mandelbrot set infected in its depths by cubic energies.  The 
; scene lies at a depth where the cubic energies predominate.
; 
; The image rates a 6 both in art and math.  I named it 
; "Mediation" after my finger missed the letter 't' between the 
; 'i' and 'a'.  The calculation time of 37 minutes will go much 
; faster on any machine less than 15 years old.
; 
; The next FOTD should be posted tomorrow, that is if I don't get 
; involved in another heated internet debate.  Until then, take 
; care, and the truth is out there . . . I guess.
