; FOTX0511 -- On_the_Half_Shell (Rating A-4,M-4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's minor effort is worth at least a quick look, though it 
; will not set any records for beauty.  It is a minibrot that lies 
; on a tendril extending from a bud of the parent fractal that 
; results when 1.6 parts of Z^-1.9 are combined with 0.2 parts of 
; Z^-9.1.  The shell-like effect that inspired the name was 
; achieved by rendering the image with the outside set to 'tdis'
; 
; The good news is that my fingers really do remember the Fractint 
; keystrokes, I just cannot think of the strokes when I 
; consciously try to recall them, making frequent diversions to 
; the help index necessary.  I am also a bit rusty on finding 
; minibrots and other good fractal scenes.  A year ago, these 
; fractal things were turning up almost automatically.  Today, I 
; needed to take time to try to guess where the scenic areas of 
; the parent fractal might lie, if any might exist.  My success 
; was questionable.
; 
; Maybe I have become too involved in the debate over the meaning 
; of quantum theory.  The math of quantum theory is not in 
; question, it works great.  The problem is that the quantum world 
; appears to consist of only the math that defines it.  Things 
; like electrons and photons can be seen as tiny balls, spread out 
; waves, neither or both.  In all cases the same math applies.  
; The problem arises when the math is squeezed into our very 
; limited, common sense idea of a world of 3-D space filled with 
; real objects, which raises the measurement problem.
; 
; The measurement problem arises because the real world is made of 
; sub-atomic particles, and the sub-atomic particles consist of 
; numbers.  The means that the real world is basically made of 
; numbers, and numbers are pure abstractions, with no material 
; reality at all.  The problem is that no one can show with 
; certainty how abstract numbers can create real physical 
; material.  Perhaps the greatest embarrassment of science is that 
; even after 90 years of pondering, this problem is still 
; unresolved.
; 
; Considering all this, it seems to me as if the real world might 
; be much like a computer video game, where the fantasy world of 
; the game exists only as program information until it is 
; displayed on the screen, observed, and thereby made real.  But 
; if this is taken to be true, it will make no difference in 
; everyday life, since everything we have always considered real 
; will still appear and behave the same.
; 
; But rational materialists are quite upset by this.  Maybe their 
; concern is that their philosphical world view is being 
; threatened.  Quantum theory seems to be drifting toward 
; mysticism, which is the antithesis of rational science and says 
; that the material world is an illusion.  In an effort to show 
; how silly such views are, rationalists refer to such views, 
; which are very common among new-agers, as 'Quantum Woo'.  At the 
; same time, Atheists are annoyed by quantum theory because it can 
; easily be misused as an argument for the existence of God.
; 
; This debate is quite understandable.   After all, everyone needs 
; a solid foundation on which to base their life's philosophical 
; standpoint, be it the white bearded old man in the sky of 
; religion or the rock solid reality of the material universe on 
; which science is based.
; 
; But fractals can be enjoyed by everyone, whether the images are 
; real or not, or whether God exists or not, and the real world 
; can likewise be enjoyed by everyone, even if it turns out to be 
; no more real than fractals and if God is actually proved to 
; exist.
; 
; There are problems with the FOTD web sites, so I'll not post any 
; web addresses until the problems are resolved.
; 
; Today was cloudy and dreary but dry here at Fractal Central, 
; with a temperature of 63F 17C.  The fractal cats spent most of 
; the day worrying about the feral tomcats that are again becoming 
; more numerous around the area.  And to make things worse, we 
; think there could be kittens under the fractal back porch.  FL 
; is also rather down because the cool wet weather is causing her 
; garden to lag.  The next FOT... will be posted whenever it is.  
; Until whenever, take care, and I'm either a believer or an 
; Atheist, depending on how God is described.
