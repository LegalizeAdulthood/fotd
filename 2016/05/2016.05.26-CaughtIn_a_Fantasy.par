; FOTX -- May 26, 2016 (RatingA-8.5,M-7.5 )
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a scene in a parent fractal that on its 
; surface is an everyday quadratic M-set.  But this parent is 
; contaminated in its depths by cubic energies.  The location is 
; in the northern of the two East Valleys (Elephant Valleys) of 
; the large minibrot on the main spike of the parent M-set, which 
; lies at the depth where the cubic contamination first appears.  
; But even at today's rather deep magnitude the cubic energies 
; have not yet been totally absorbed by the cubic, which is 
; visible in the subtle 3-6-9-27.... rather than the expected 
; 3-9-27.... series of arms surrounding the minibrot.
; 
; I rated the art aspect at an honorable 8.5, since I'm starting 
; to work off the rust and get back into the well-oiled world of 
; fractals worth being considered art.  The math does not do too 
; bad either.  The rating of a 7.5 is right up there with the 
; big-time images.
; 
; The name "Caught in a Fantasy" is simply a statement of fact.  
; After all, what are fractals if they are not manifestations of 
; the things numbers do, just as the real world, whose ultimate 
; reality I now consider questionable, appears to be when we look 
; deeper into the quantum.
; 
; Actually, the more I delve into QM, the more confused I become.  
; Just this morning I read on the internet that all electrons are 
; exactly the same, so that they basically ARE the same electron, 
; which means that in a sense there is only one electron in the 
; universe, and it is therefore questionable to use the word 
; 'electron' in the plural sense.  It might be better to think of 
; an electron as a local manifestation of a universal field.
; 
; This seemed clear enough until I read on another site that some 
; think there could be changeable values hidden in electron(s), 
; and if this were so, it would make some puzzling quantum facts 
; more sensible.  But then I wondered how all electrons can be 
; considered identical if they also may have variable attributes 
; hidden within them.  The only thing for sure now is that I am 
; far from grasping quantum theory.
; 
; Things went fairly smoothly here at Fractal Central today.  The 
; weather was partly cloudy with a temperature of 88F 31C and 
; higher but still not oppressive humidity.  A few showers 
; threatened in the evening but never materialized.  The next FOTX 
; will appear in a day or two or three.  Until whenever, take 
; care, and maybe the quantum world is a huge fractal.
