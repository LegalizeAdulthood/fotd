; FOTD -- April 24, 2002 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is a picture of a midget in the Z^sqrt(3)+C 
; fractal, a fractal that is infinite both in surface extent and 
; in its depth.  The particular midget in today's image is located 
; in a cut-off fragment of a spiral elephant-trunk located in the 
; East Valley area of the parent fractal, which is shaped 
; surprisingly like the classic M-set.
; 
; This midget is one of the more interesting ones I have found in 
; the range between the linear non-fractal Z+C and the ultimate 
; fractal Z^2+C.  The MandelbrotBC1 formula is a great help in 
; getting the most out of fractals in this range.  If the image on 
; one level of the logarithmic spiral shows little of interest, 
; I merely go up to the next level by adjusting the real(p2) 
; parameter.
; 
; I named the image "Scherzo", a word that describes a lively and 
; humorous musical composition.  It was the first word that came 
; to mind, and has little to do with the actual appearance of the 
; fractal.  Because it is perhaps the most satisfactory midget I 
; have yet found in these under Z^2 fractals, I rated it a lofty 
; 8, a rating that might be a bit liberal.
; 
; An extra feature of the image is that it renders from the 
; parameter file in under 5 minutes.  But 5 minutes can seem an 
; awfully long time when one is waiting for a fractal to finish 
; and other things need to be done.  Relief for impatience is at 
; hand in the form of the completed GIF image, which is available 
; on the W.W.Web at Paul's site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Tuesday here at Fractal Central was brisk 
; and breezy, with a temperature of 55F 13C.  But a strong sun 
; peeking between the clouds gave enough warmth on the porch to 
; keep the fractal cats happy for over an hour.
; 
; My happiness did not arrive until I had most of the day's work 
; behind me.  And then I was happy.  I'll be even happier when 
; today's work is behind me.  But the greatest happiness of all 
; will come when the FOTD CD is finished and if it proves to be a 
; success.  I'm currently involved in re-writing many of the short 
; stories I have written over the past 20 years.  When reading my 
; own writing some 10 to 20 years after I wrote it, I sometimes 
; wonder how I could have written something so trite, and then 
; there are the all-too-few times when I wonder how I could have 
; written something so good.  Regardless, the next ongoing FOTD 
; will appear on April 27th.  Until then, take care, and hold your 
; breath.
