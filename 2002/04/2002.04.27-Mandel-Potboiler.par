; FOTD -- April 27, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was created with the MandelbrotMix2 formula, which 
; is a more versatile version of the workhorse MandelbrotMix4 
; formula.  The new formula has a new variable p4 parameter, which 
; offers control of the starting point of Z.  When p4 is set to 
; 0,0, the new formula works exactly like the M-Mix4 formula, and 
; has the same speed.
; 
; I added the new parameter because many of the expressions I have 
; been calculating with the M-Mix4 formula have more than one 
; critical point, and I wanted the ability to explore these other 
; critical starting points.  So far, I have found little of 
; interest in the other critical planes of the fractals I have 
; explored, but the exploration has just begun, and some surprises 
; are sure to appear.
; 
; Since the p4 parameter of today's image is 0,0, the image could 
; just as easily have been drawn by the M-Mix4 formula, which may 
; be headed for a long-overdue retirement.  I named the image 
; "Mandel Potboiler" because, like a cheap romance novel, it is a 
; rather pretentious image with a lot of surface sparkle but 
; little depth.  The bubble-like features also helped inspire the 
; name.  The surface sparkle gives the image a rating of an 
; average 5; the lack of depth precludes a higher rating.
; 
; The render time is under 7 minutes -- a bit slow for such an 
; average image.  But relief for impatience may be found on the 
; web at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; where the pre-rendered GIF image will soon be posted.
; 
; The fractal weather Friday here at Fractal Central was near 
; perfect, resulting in near perfect fractal cats.  With clear 
; skies, warm sun, and a temperature of 66F 19C, the cats spent 
; all afternoon on the porch.  Tippy even started to stalk a robin 
; that ventured dangerously close, but the bird saw Tippy coming 
; and flew away well before Tippy was within pouncing range.  
; Thomas watched the whole affair with interest.
; 
; As for me, I've got work to do, both for money and for fun.  And 
; there's also that grass which was trimmed only six days ago but 
; already is waving in the breeze again.  And the FOTD CD also has 
; a way to go yet.  So I guess it's time to say farewell until 
; next time, which will be here in two wags of Thomas's tail.  
; Until the tail wags, take care, and enjoy the illusion.
