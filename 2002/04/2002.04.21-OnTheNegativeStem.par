; FOTD -- April 21, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The image-rerendering stage of the FOTD CD preparation is 
; complete, as is the organization of the FOTD discussions.  What 
; I now need to make the disk a big seller (25 copies) is 
; something extra.  I already have hundreds of fractals that I 
; produced before I started the FOTD in April 1997.  I also have 
; scores of short and not-so-short stories on science-fiction, 
; philosophical and mystical themes that I have been writing at 
; intervals over the past 20 years.  But I still need something 
; extra to make the disk move out like water at a marathon race.  
; Cat pictures might be just the thing . . .
; 
; Today's image is from my archives.  I found it over a year ago 
; while I was working on fractal images that resemble lizard skin. 
; The name "On the Negative Stem" describes the location of the 
; midget in the image.  And doesn't the term 'negative stem' sound 
; better than 'negative tail'?
; 
; After a moment's consideration, I rated the image a 7.  The 
; unusually powerful textures garnered that above-average rating.  
; The 7-minute render time is a bit slow, so a download may be the 
; better choice.  The download can be found at Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Saturday here at Fractal Central featured 
; lots of clouds and warm temperatures around 82F 28C.  The cats 
; must consider such conditions ideal because they were outdoors 
; from 10am until sunset, which is just before 8pm at this time of 
; year.  They behaved all the time like angels, one of the few 
; days this has ever happened.
; 
; As for me, it's just past 11am and I must get moving.  Until 
; next time, take care, and don't get abstracted by the abstract
; features of fractals.
