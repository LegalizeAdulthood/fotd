; FOTD -- April 12, 2002 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal shows what happens when a near-linear expression 
; such as Z^1.009+C is iterated.  As can be seen from the image, 
; not too much actually does happen, other than a scattering of 
; fragments that barely present a theme.
; 
; After standing back from the screen, trying to recall what it is 
; that the image reminds me of, I remembered the famous picture of 
; the dust pillars of a stellar nursery which was taken by the 
; space telescope.  I quickly decided on the name "Cosmic 
; Nursery".  The image could equally represent the last rays of 
; the setting sun striking the snow-capped peaks of a mountain 
; range to the east.  In this case, I would have named the image 
; something like "Mysterious Mountains".
; 
; But names cannot make an image, and today's image has little 
; other than its name going for it.  As a result, I could rate the 
; result of today's brief effort no higher than a 3.
; 
; The wannabe great image can be viewed by running the attached 
; parameter file, which will take 1/2 hour, or by visiting one of 
; the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and downloading the finished image from there.
; 
; The fractal weather Thursday was quite pleasant, with warm sun, 
; gentle breezes, and a temperature of 64F 18C.  These are cat-
; pleasing conditions.  The cats showed their pleasure by sleeping 
; most of the afternoon.  Like all cats, the older they get, the 
; less they romp and the more they sleep.
; 
; As for me, I'm entering a critical phase of the FOTD CD 
; preparation.  As Murphy's law would dictate, the more critical 
; the phase of preparation, the greater the amount of other things 
; to be done.  And I'm still keeping the ongoing FOTD's coming on 
; schedule, appearing every day of the month evenly divisible by 
; 3.  The next FOTD will appear April 15.  Until then, take care, 
; and don't be distracted.
