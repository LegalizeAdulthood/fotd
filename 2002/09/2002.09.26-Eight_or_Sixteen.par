; FOTD -- September 26, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There must be a name for someone as obsessed with fractal 
; midgets as I am, but if there is, I have yet to find it.  
; Today's image features yet another midget.  The little thing 
; might be too small to be visible, but be assured, it is there at 
; the center, waiting for revelation, though looking little better 
; when seen in person than it does at this distance.
; 
; The formula behind the image combines portions of 
; Z^(-0.414213562373) and Z^(-2.414213562373).  These two numbers 
; are reciprocal to each other, and even more curious, the decimal 
; parts of these numbers are equal to the decimal part of the 
; square root of 2.  This curious coincidence might have a deeper 
; mathematical meaning, or it might not.
; 
; In any case, the coincidence has little effect on the appearance 
; of the fractal the numbers generate.  The parent fractal 
; resembles a first-quarter moon, (last-quarter in the southern 
; hemisphere), with today's scene lying in some rather unique 
; appearing material on the northern terminator of the moon.
; 
; For unknown reasons I named the image "Eight-or-Sixteen".  
; Because it is only a bit above average, I rated it a 6.  Because 
; the 7-minute render time is a bit slow, it might be more 
; convenient to download the pre-rendered GIF image from Paul's 
; web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and thereby save a few minutes.
; 
; The fractal weather Wednesday featured increasingly thick clouds 
; as the moisture from a tropical storm drifted this way.  But the 
; temperature was a comfortable 75F 24C, and all else was under 
; control, giving the fractal cats a pleasant day, actually romp-
; ing in the yard.  When their fun was done, the dynamic duo had 
; an enjoyable treat of tuna.  All-in-all they had one of their 
; all-time best days.  I hope their mood is just as congenial this 
; week-end when I try to take up-to-date photographs of them for 
; the soon-to-appear FOTD CD.
; 
; As for me, my day will be the best only when I get the work 
; done.  And if I hope to do that, I've got to get started.  So 
; until next FOTD, which will appear on schedule on Saturday the 
; 28th, take care, and solve the mysteries.
