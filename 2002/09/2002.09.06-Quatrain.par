; FOTD -- September 06, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Before posting my FOTD's, I always check the attached parameter 
; files to see that they work.  Almost without exception the files 
; run as they should.  However, when posting the most recent FOTD, 
; the one for Sep. 4, I neglected for some reason to check the 
; parameter file before clicking the send button.  This oversight 
; gave Murphy's law the chance it needed to work its mischief.  
; When I finally did check the file later in the day, I found that 
; a backslash was missing from the end of a broken line, causing 
; an error message to appear when the file was run.  My apologies 
; for any inconvenience.
; 
; Today's attached parameter file most definitely will run.  The 
; image it will draw will take 7 minutes to complete, and hope-
; fully will be worth the time spent.  The image that will appear 
; lies in the fractal that results when -1.1 parts of Z are com-
; bined with -1.1 parts of Z^20 before adding C.  This parent 
; fractal is actually a classic Mandelbrot set caught in the act 
; of morphing into the Z^20 Mandeloid.  Today's scene lies in a 
; curving valley at the mouth of a small bay on the east edge of 
; the distorted M-set.
; 
; I named the image "Quatrain", though I can't say why.  A 
; quatrain is a four-line stanza of a poem.  Maybe I noticed the 
; nearly square olive-green feature around the obligatory central 
; midget.  Regardless, it's a striking image, which looks as good 
; from a distance as it does up close.  Not wanting to appear 
; boastful, I rated it a 6, which is above average, though not by 
; much.
; 
; The trip back out of the parent fractal is interesting also.  
; Those with a little time to spare might wish to change the 
; logmap to 0, the passes to G and make the journey at thumbnail 
; size.
; 
; As always, the completed GIF file of the image will soon be 
; available on the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Thursday here at Fractal Central was perfect 
; beyond description, so I won't try to describe the indescribable 
; other than to say that the temperature of 83F 28C pleased the 
; cats so much that their sour dispositions turned cheerful after 
; a couple hours in the yard.
; 
; As for me, I've got a couple hours of work ahead of me, and my 
; disposition won't improve until the work is behind me.  The 
; solution . . . get the work started.  Until next time on Sunday 
; the 8th, take care, and double check your figures.
