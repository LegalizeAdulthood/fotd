; FOTD -- September 20, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To produce today's image I took 1/10 part of 1/Z and subtracted 
; 1-1/10 parts of Z^1.1 from it.  The resulting fractal consists 
; of two distorted Mandelbrot sets sitting side-by-side in the 
; upper half of the screen.  The two sets are distorted in 
; different ways.  The set on the left lacks a prominent period-2 
; bud, while the set on the right has its period-3 buds shifted 
; almost into East Valley.  There are mathematical reasons for 
; these distortions, which are beyond the scope of this 
; discussion, (meaning I don't know the reasons), but the inner 
; details of the two sets are much the same as the familiar M-set.
; 
; To find new and interesting types of midgets, one must get away 
; from the familiar.  Checking today's parent fractal, I noticed 
; that a large quantity of fractal debris is scattered between the 
; two large Mandeloids.  Today's scene is located in this debris.
; 
; I named the image Red-Green-Blue, since it has large quantities 
; of these primary colors in it.  The blue midget is surrounded by 
; a reddish aura, which in turn is surrounded by a field of 
; greenish stars against a black background.  The whole thing 
; could be worth a rating of 8, but, looking at the result, I get 
; the impression that I tried too hard on the coloring.  The 
; actual rating of an above-average 7 seems just about right.
; 
; The render time of 7 minutes is acceptable, though still a bit 
; slow.  As always, the completed GIF image will soon be available 
; on the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; I am considering whether to resume posting the FOTD images and 
; discussions to:
; 
;           <alt.binaries.pictures.fractals>
; 
; I realize that posting to usenet is an invitation to spammers, 
; but every spammer on earth must already have my address, and the 
; most it can mean is a few more strikes of the delete key.  
; Besides, my FOTD-CD will soon be ready, and I'll need to give it 
; a little publicity.
; 
; The weather Thursday here at Fractal Central was unnotable . . . 
; except to the dynamic cats that is.  The cloudy skies, tempera-
; ture of 79F 26C and the moderately high humidity were a bit too 
; much for their comfort.  They would have preferred drier air, 
; more sun, and a temperature a few degrees cooler.  But despite 
; their discomfort, they managed to spend over an hour in the 
; yard, watching the squirrels gathering nuts and remembering the 
; days when they had the energy to actually chase and maybe even 
; catch a squirrel.
; 
; As for me, I definitely have the energy and the work to expend 
; it on.  But if I don't get started, I'll never finish.  So until 
; next FOTD, which will arrive in two days on Sunday the 22nd, 
; take care, and don't have an out-of-fractal experience.
