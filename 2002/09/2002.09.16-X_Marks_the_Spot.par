; FOTD -- September 16, 2002 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The fractal for today is a winner, a little gem that honestly 
; earns its immodest rating of 8.  It was created with my little-
; used MandelbrotMix3 formula, which combines four different 
; powers of Z but leaves finding a critical point up to the user.  
; Luckily, I have another formula which finds the critical points 
; graphically, so this is not too much of a problem.
; 
; Today's image is partially evaporated, consisting as it does of 
; 80 percent inside and 20 percent outside.  The greatest surprise 
; came when, trying different inside fills, I found that the 
; < zmag > fill gives the most pleasing results.  Normally, this 
; fill results in too chaotic an effect, but in today's already-
; chaotic scene, it works to near perfection.
; 
; The straight criss-crossing ridge-like areas that fill the 
; background are most unusual.  They appear to have been intro-
; duced artificially, but they are quite natural.  A midget of 
; sorts lies at the center of attention, where the most prominent 
; ridges cross.  The midget is not really all there, but its 
; strange energy field is very much present, being revealed by the 
; inside fill.
; 
; Since the image is filled with X's, I named it "X Marks the 
; Spot".  One glance at the image will show that the rating of 8 
; is fully justified.  The 37-minute render time however is a bit 
; trying, but the wait can be eliminated by downloading the 
; completed GIF image from:

; 
; or from:

; 
; The weather Sunday here at Fractal Central was cloudy and muggy 
; with occasional showers of rain.  The temperature of 79F 26C 
; fell in the comfort range of the fractal cats, but the wet grass 
; and drippy trees kept the dynamic duo confined to the indoors 
; through most of the afternoon, where they expressed their dis-
; pleasure by making themselves obnoxious.
; 
; It's cloudy again this morning, but with a forecast of a drying 
; trend starting this afternoon, the cats should have a better 
; day.  My day will turn better once I have finished the work 
; before me.  Until next time, take care, and be careful around 
; those dangerous fractals.
