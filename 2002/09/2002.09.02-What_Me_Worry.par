; FOTD -- September 02, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Fractal buds come in all shapes and sizes, enclosing, as they 
; do, areas of a particular periodicity.  Most buds are of the 
; quadratic variety, and therefore nearly circular, but some buds 
; are true oddballs, such as the bud that appears in today's image.
; 
; Today's bud is shaped more like a bowling pin than a Mandelbrot 
; bud.  And instead of smaller buds around its perimeter, it has 
; various bits and pieces of entire M-sets.  The apparent head of 
; the bowling pin is actually a distorted and incomplete M-set, 
; which is connected to the body of the bud.  The connection forms 
; the neck of the pin.
; 
; The overall appearance of the distorted bud creates a feeling of 
; humorous goofiness, much as does the face of the cartoon 
; character who speaks the words that are the name of today's 
; image -- "What Me Worry".
; 
; The rating of 4 is a bit below average, because the image isn't 
; really that great.  But the image is a real curiosity, and if it 
; is not quite worth the 1/2-hour render time from the parameter 
; file, it is at least worth the download from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; As always, give Paul and Scott a chance to render and post the 
; image before visiting their FOTD sites.
; 
; The weather Sunday here at Fractal Central featured steady rain 
; and a temperature of 65F 18C . . . if such conditions can be 
; considered a feature that is.  The cats certainly did not enjoy 
; their forced indoor confinement, and loudly let me know their 
; displeasure.  A treat of left-over turkey breast only partially 
; relieved their distress.
; 
; Today promises to be a far better day, with far less rain.  On 
; days such as this, it's best to do as little work as possible, 
; so I'll make that my goal.  Until next FOTD on Wednesday the 
; 4th, take much care but not too much care.
