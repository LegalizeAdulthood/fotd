; FOTD -- September 22, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The autumnal equinox is almost here, heralding the season of 
; blue skies, colorful falling leaves, and acorns.  The mystery 
; is why the leaves, which are so enjoyable while they are on the 
; trees, become so unenjoyable once they fall to the ground and 
; have to be raked up and disposed of.  The answer to that mystery 
; may never be known, but the fact that eight colorful oak leaves 
; appear in today's FOTD image cannot be denied.
; 
; The formula that produced the leaves subtracts 1.3 parts of 
; Z^0.9 from 1.3 parts of 1/Z, then adds 1/C, resulting in a scene 
; on the verge of evaporation.  Indeed, if the value of the 
; imag(p3) parameter, which sets the bailout radius, is increased, 
; the image soon breaks into scattered fractal debris, and then 
; goes totally blank, changing into an evaporated all-inside image 
; that can be seen only by using an inside fill something like 
; bof61.  Curiously, if imag(p3) is decreased, the image also goes 
; blank, though in this case the image consists of flat outside 
; material.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image consists of a very distorted 
; Mandeloid with an open eye, perhaps the all-seeing eye of 
; you-know-what, lying just to the right.  The scene itself lies 
; in a valley that is not really a valley, which separates the 
; Mandeloid from the eye.
; 
; I originally intended to rate today's image a 7, but upon 
; re-viewing it after a restful night, I decided a 6 would be more 
; appropriate.  I named the image "Autumnal Equinox", and why not? 
; The equinox is but a few hours away, and at least in the 
; northern hemisphere, the leaves are starting to turn colors.
; 
; The 20-minute render time drags, but as always, the completed 
; GIF image is or soon will be available on the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Saturday was partly cloudy and humid, with a 
; temperature of 88F 31C.  Showers threatened in the afternoon, 
; but never moved in.  The fractal cats, being intrepid, ignored 
; the threat of rain, and had a pleasant afternoon in the yard, 
; doing little but sitting and thinking.
; 
; As for me, it's Sunday morning and all is well.  If I simply 
; relax and let nature have its way, things could remain well all 
; day.  The next FOTD will appear on Tuesday the 24th.  Until 
; then, take care, and don't lose your way in the valley of the 
; lost fractals.
