; FOTD -- July 30, 2002 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal reminds me of another real-world object.  In 
; this case, I see the graceful swaying of seaweed, a few meters 
; under the surface near some tropical shore.  The scene is also 
; filled with schools of small, colorful tropical fish, though 
; these are more difficult to pick out.
; 
; With all this underwater activity in mind, I named the image 
; "Aquatic Life".  Then I stepped back to evaluate the result.  
; After much mental wrestling, I rated the image a much-above-
; average 8.
; 
; The formula of the aquatic scene is Z^(-1.1)+Z^(-11)+(1/C), 
; a simple expression that does more than it should.  But as I 
; stated recently, it is not the formula that works the magic; it 
; is the 280 iterations.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's scene appears as a large open bay 
; with many buds and valleys around its perimeter.  Today's scene 
; is located in the center of a blunt valley on the south shore of 
; the main bay.  The aquatic effect was achieved by rendering the 
; scene with the outside set to the <tdis> option, followed by 
; careful coloring.
; 
; The render time of just over 1 minute makes running the attached 
; parameter file the quickest way of seeing the seaweed.  But 
; downloading the completed GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; might be a lot more fun.
; 
; The weather Monday here at the (IMO) center of the fractal world 
; was hot, hot, hot.  A breeze and slightly lower humidity made it 
; feel less oppressive than it otherwise might have been, but 100F 
; 38C is still hot -- there's no escaping it.  The heat was so 
; severe that it buckled the rails of a local rail line, causing 
; a train to derail.
; 
; The dynamic fractal cats avoided the excessive heat by passing 
; the day in the air-cooled indoors, though they did check several 
; times just to be sure it really was that hot outside.
; 
; Today is Tuesday, and it's another scorcher -- a perfect excuse 
; for me to stay indoors and get a little ahead on the upcoming 
; convention program that needs to be finished within a week.  
; Until next time, which will come in 3 days on August 2, take 
; care, and why are tropical shores with all their humidity and 
; heat considered paradise on earth?.
