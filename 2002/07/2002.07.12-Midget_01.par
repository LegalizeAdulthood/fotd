; FOTD -- July 12, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The high point of Thursday came at 2pm when a 3-alarm fire broke 
; out in the local animal hospital.  Luckily the staff got all the 
; animals out of the building in time, but the building is a total 
; loss.  When I told the news to the dynamic duo, they looked up 
; and said, 'good, now we'll never have to go to that terrible 
; place again.'
; 
; Unlike the cats' trips to that particular hospital, my trips to 
; the Mandelbrot set will never come to an end.  Simply too much 
; stuff exists to be seen there.  In today's image for example, we 
; travel to a midget just beyond the negative stem of a midget in 
; the eastern suburbs of the prominent midget on the negative stem 
; of the M-set.  If you can decipher that last sentence, you know 
; where today's scene is located.
; 
; The rendering is boringly conventional, with equal-iteration-
; bands on the outside and the color 000 on the inside.  The only 
; change from the default is the bailout, which has been raised 
; from 4 to 6.
; 
; I named the image "Midget-01" more as a catalog entry than a 
; description.  After a few minutes of study, I rated the image at 
; a perfectly normal 5.  I put too little effort into creating the 
; image and coloring it to rate the result any higher.
; 
; A careful study of the image will reveal features characteristic 
; of both the Eastern and Western suburbs of Mandelbrot midgets.  
; Combined with the resetting of the number of elements 
; surrounding the central midget, this is a sure sign that the 
; midget in today's image is part of the family of a larger midget.
; 
; I entered the mathtolerance=/0 parameter into the parameter file 
; by hand to force the program to use arbitrary precision math.  
; Though the image renders using both conventional and arbitrary 
; math, the arbitrary math, which takes 70 times as long, results 
; in a slightly better image.
; 
; Those willing to spend 8 minutes watching the image appear can 
; run the attached parameter file.  Those with more important ways 
; to spend their time may download the completed GIF image from 
; Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Thursday was absolutely perfect, with a 
; temperature of 80F 27C and a crystal blue sky streaked with 
; angel-hair cirrus.  The dynamic duo made the most of the 
; perfection by spending the entire afternoon in the yard.  They 
; seemed not the least concerned about their doctor's office 
; burning down.
; 
; As for myself, today will seem a lot more perfect when the work 
; is behind me.  But to bring about that condition I must begin, 
; and the time to begin is now.  Until next time on the 14th, take 
; care, and the unexpected strikes when least expected.
