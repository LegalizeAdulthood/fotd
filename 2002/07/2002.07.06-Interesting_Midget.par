; FOTD -- July 06, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Interesting Midget".  'Interesting' or 
; 'nice' is what I say about something when I want to say 
; something good but can't find any particular aspect to say 
; something good about.  I use the words frequently in my 
; non-fractal life when I must decline customers' suggestions that 
; I know will never work.  The midget in today's image, with its 
; vaguely familiar decorations, is 'nice' in a broad, generic sort 
; of way -- In other words, it is interesting.  
; 
; Finding interesting midgets, or interesting fractals of any 
; kind, can sometimes be a real challenge.  Though the parent 
; fractals may appear promising, all too often they hold no 
; midgets, or if the midgets are there, they merely exhibit a 
; duplication of features found in various parts of the Mandelbrot 
; set.
; 
; When I first saw the oversized parent fractal of today's scene, 
; it did not even look promising, but something told me that a 
; FOTD was hiding somewhere down in its depths.  And indeed, my 
; intuition turned out to be true.  The midget lay very deep 
; indeed, but it was there, waiting to be discovered and revealed 
; to the world, or at least a small part thereof.
; 
; The route down to the midget was long and quite eventful, and 
; can be traveled in reverse by setting the logmap to zero and 
; outzooming about 10 times.  The formula itself, which adds 1/10 
; part of Z^(-11.1) to Z^(-1.11) then adds (1/C), is 
; unexceptional, but in the world of fractals, unexceptional 
; beginnings sometimes lead to exceptional ends.
; 
; Undecided whether to rate today's image a 6 or a 7, I finally 
; decided on a 6.  It is a bit above average, though if I continue 
; to produce fractals of this same quality, the average will rise, 
; and I'll need to start rating them a 5.
; 
; The render time of around 8 minutes on a run-down P200 machine 
; is marginal, but the wait can be avoided by letting Paul and 
; Scott render the image and then picking it up from their web 
; sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Friday here at Fractal Central was sunny and 
; still very warm, but the temperature of 92F 33C and drier air 
; was far better than the humid 106F 41C that was registered in 
; the center of the city Thursday.  The cats actually spent an 
; entire hour outdoors in the shade of the dogwood tree, watching 
; the starlings fly by.
; 
; As for me, I'm planning another restful day.  There's not too 
; much work to be done, and I might actually get a chance to rest. 
; But regardless, I'll return in two days on Monday, July 8, with 
; another glorious (I hope) fractal to delight and amaze.  Until 
; then, take care, and don't let the fractals obstruct your view.
