; FOTD -- July 14, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is one to puzzle the 
; fractal pundits.  (If pundits can be puzzled, that is.)
; 
; The puzzle lies not in today's image itself, which, with its 
; eight arms ending in irregular holes, and well-defined areas, 
; is pleasant enough, but in its location in relation to the 
; entire parent fractal.
; 
; The midget at the center of today's picture lies near an 
; irregular hole, which lies just to the north of a quadratic 
; midget, which in turn lies in the suburbs of a cubic midget, 
; which lies in the basin of an order-6 midget, which lies in the 
; center of a kind of unstable East Valley of the parent fractal.  
; I'm not exaggerating all this variety.  Set the logmap to 0, and 
; do the outzooms to see for yourself.
; 
; I call the valley unstable because it is very sensitive to 
; changes in the real(p3) parameter.  A string of midgets extends 
; down the center line of this valley.  Nothing unusual in a 
; string of midgets, but no two midgets in this line are the same. 
; Instead of the expected string of identical quadratic midgets, 
; there are midgets of every shape and order, and some midgets 
; that combine parts of midgets of different orders.  Interesting 
; exploration certainly waits in this valley, and I'll be 
; wandering in it for the next several FOTD's.  I might not find a 
; lost civilization, but I'll find some interesting images for 
; sure.
; 
; I named today's image "8-Legged Weirdo".  The picture itself, 
; which rates a 6, is not that weird, but the area of the parent 
; in which it lies is one of the most unusual I have ever ventured 
; upon.  The rating is conservative but honest.
; 
; The render time of near 25 minutes on a classic P200 machine is 
; on the slow side.  A far more efficient way of seeing the scene 
; is to download the completed GIF file from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Saturday featured lots of clouds and 
; temperatures on the cool side for this, the hottest time of the 
; year.  But the high of 81F 27C was mild enough for the dynamic 
; duo to spend several comfortable hours in the yard, remembering 
; the days when they could actually catch those birds and 
; squirrels they now only watch and chatter at.
; 
; As I write this, it's Sunday morning and the clouds have turned 
; to light rain.  It's a perfect day for doing nothing and 
; enjoying it.  As always, I'll return in 2 days with the next in 
; the unending series of FOTD images.  Until then, take care, and 
; keep your powder dry, (whatever that means.)
