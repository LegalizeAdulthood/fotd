; FOTD -- July 28, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's 7-rated image "The Helm" because of the 
; resemblance it bears to a ship's wheel.
; 
; Almost all my FOTD fractals are named after a resemblance they 
; bear to a real-world object.  This tendency to find the familiar 
; in the unfamiliar is a universal human trait, perhaps best 
; illustrated by the "faces in the clouds" illusion.
; 
; No ship's wheel exists in today's image, which is merely a 
; mapping to the screen of the number of iterations required 
; before the iterated points of the image pass beyond the bailout 
; radius.  The coloring does not exist in the formula, but was 
; consciously added by myself to enhance the resemblance to a 
; wheel.
; 
; Today's image is in fact nothing but one of the many ways in 
; which the basic underlying mathematical abstraction could have 
; been made manifest.  The same formula could just as easily have 
; created a piece of fractal 'music'.  (Though I have yet to hear 
; a piece of fractal 'music' that was worth being listened to more 
; than once.  [Or even once, for that matter.])
; 
; Today's generating formula -- 1.5(Z^1.1)+1.5(Z^11)+(1/C) -- is 
; unusually simple.  This is not surprising.  When working with 
; fractals, long convoluted formulae are unnecessary, and in fact 
; often not worth the effort of writing them.  Complex formulae 
; are not needed, because the iterations work the magic.  Great 
; images come from skillful searching, not necessarily from 200-
; line-long formulae.
; 
; The above statements are my personal opinion of course, 
; especially the statement about fractal 'music' being worthless.  
; Since beauty exists in the mind of the beholder, it may be that 
; my mind is not tuned to the mental frequency of the appreciation 
; of fractal 'music' and all the beauty in the music passes right 
; through me like light through the invisible man.
; 
; Forgetting the worth or non-worth of fractal music, the render 
; time of today's image is a fast 3 minutes on my brave little 
; P200 fractal machine.  Approximately the same time will be 
; required to download the completed GIF image from Paul's FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's FOTD site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The route to enjoyment of the image is left to the viewer.
; 
; The weather Saturday here at Fractal Central was not perfect, 
; but it could have been a lot worse.  The temperature was held to 
; a muggy 83F 28C by heavy clouds, which threatened all day but 
; produced only a few drops of rain.  The cats, who dislike high 
; humidity, briefly checked the outdoor conditions, then decided 
; to spend the day indoors.
; 
; And I'm about ready to spend today relaxing.  Until next time, 
; take care, and where is that "Theory of Everything for Dummies" 
; book?
