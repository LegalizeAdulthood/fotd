; FOTD -- July 04, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Sensible people see a fractal, say ho-hum, and forget about the 
; thing.  Others, not quite as sensible, discover fractals and are 
; surprised at their variety, then experiment with them for maybe 
; a month or two, and eventually grow bored and move on to more 
; sensible and productive endeavors.  Those like myself, who have 
; gone beyond the need to act with common sense, become obsessed 
; with the endless intricacies and spend years, perhaps a life-
; time, exploring the limitless varieties of the things numbers do.
; 
; And like those fractal fans, some fractals make no sense at all. 
; (Maybe all fractals make no sense, but that's another story.)  
; Today's image is an example of a senseless, illogical and 
; thoroughly irrational fractal.  For some reason known only to 
; who or whatever is in charge of the things numbers do, the 
; midget in today's image lies exactly on the shoreline of its 
; parent, with its east (bottom) half surrounded by the expected 
; outside material, but its west (top) half existing invisibly in 
; the potential inside material that forms the upper half of the 
; image.
; 
; Since invisible things are hard to see, I made the invisible 
; visible by coloring the inside with the <fmod> option, with the 
; proximity set to 0.085.  The result is one of the more unusual 
; midgets in the FOTD series.  The real(p3) parameter is the one 
; that works the mischief.  It is critical, and must be set just 
; right to get the half-and-half effect.
; 
; I named the image "Mandelbrot Network" because of the delicate 
; network-like elements in the top half of the image.  Because of 
; the unusual nature of the image, I raised the rating one point 
; from a 6 to a 7.  I suppose it's worth the rating.
; 
; The render time of 2 to 3 minutes is quite reasonable for an 
; image with so much inside area colored with the <fmod> option.  
; And as always, those who would rather not render may find the 
; finished image posted to Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and to Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; For the benefit of those who concern themselves with the weather 
; in far corners of the earth, the fractal weather Wednesday here 
; at Fractal Central, which is located not far from 39,21N 76,32W, 
; was hotter than a firecracker, with blazing sun and a tempera-
; ture of 104F 40C.  In response, the fractal cats spent the day 
; under the air conditioning vent, stretched to near twice their 
; normal length.
; 
; Today promises to be just as hot if not hotter, but it's the 
; Independence Day holiday here in the USA, the day when fireworks 
; displays are everywhere, (except where they have been banned 
; because of fear of terrorism), and it's supposed to be hot on 
; the Fourth of July, as the day is usually called.  I might 
; wander over to the local fireworks display this evening; or I 
; might not.  I haven't decided.  In either case, I'll have 
; another glorious FOTD in two days on July 6.  Until then, take 
; care, and I'll bet there's snow falling in the New Zealand Alps.
