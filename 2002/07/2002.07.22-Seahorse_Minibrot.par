; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's glorious fractal we return to perhaps the richest 
; area in all of fractaldom -- Seahorse Valley of the Mandelbrot 
; set.  Yes, I realize that this area has been explored almost ad 
; infinitum, but it holds so many promising places that I just 
; can't let it alone.
; 
; Today's image is one of a midget located deep in a seahorse-tail 
; spiral on the west side of the valley.  The nature of the 
; location is made abundantly clear by the tightly-wound spirals 
; around the midget. I have written the mathtolerance entry into 
; the parameter file because the magnitude of the image is so 
; great that the program has a tendency to flip into arbitrary 
; math mode when calculating the image, with a big slow-down but 
; no image improvement.
; 
; Curiously, the outside=tdis setting is the cause of the 1-1/2 
; hour render time.  When calculated with outside=iter, the image 
; renders in 4 minutes.  I have no idea why the <tdis> option 
; should take over 20 times as long to render as the normal <iter> 
; method.
; 
; I named the image "Seahorse Minibrot" as more of a description 
; than a title.  Since I kind of like the amber coloring, I rated 
; the image at an above average 7.  The 90-minute render time of 
; the parameter file is quite slow.  Some may enjoy watching the 
; image majestically paint itself onto the screen; most will 
; decide to download the completed GIF image from Paul's site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Sunday here at Fractal Central was quite 
; warm and muggy, which is typical for this time of year.  The 
; temperature of 90F 32C kept the fractal cats typically lazy 
; until supper time, when they suddenly remembered they were 
; hungry and began crying to be fed.
; 
; One certain thing however is that the rest of this Monday will 
; not be lazy, at least for me, burdened as I am with a pile of 
; work to finish.  So as I begin the task, take care, and know 
; truth.
