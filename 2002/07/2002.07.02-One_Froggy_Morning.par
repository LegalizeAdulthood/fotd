; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Fractals of the Mandel-Julia variety are filled with holes, 
; especially when the iterated expression contains more than one 
; power of Z.  These holes come in many varieties.  There are the 
; obvious Mandelbrot midgets and Julia sets, and then there are 
; the other types of holes that defy description.  Today's image 
; features one of these 'other' holes.
; 
; The area in question was pointed out to me by Lee Skinner in an 
; image he sent privately several days ago.  The orange-colored 
; holes near the center are of a type I have seen in images 
; created with the branch-cuts formula when the exponent of Z is 
; in the area of 1.15, but in today's image, several things appear 
; to be happening at the same time.  It almost appears that the 
; two different powers of Z are doing things independently of each 
; other.  A math expert might be able to tell what is going on in 
; today's image, but not being a math expert, I have no idea.
; 
; While studying the image, I had the distinct impression of a 
; frog staring back at me.  I promptly named the image, "One 
; Froggy Morning".  The rating of 7 is justified because the image 
; is a bit -- well -- cute.
; 
; The render time of over one hour on a P200 machine is not cute 
; however.  I advise letting Paul and Scott do the heavy work and 
; downloading the completed image from their one of the web sites. 
; Paul's site is at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Scott's is at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Monday at Fractal Central was typical summer 
; fare for these parts of the world -- HHH -- hazy, hot and humid. 
; The temperature of 92F 33C, combined with the high humidity and 
; foul air, made the outdoors unpleasant for most of the day.  The 
; dynamic duo of cats must have agreed, for they stayed on the 
; porch only a few minutes before coming in and asking for their 
; tuna treat.
; 
; As for me, it's another Tuesday, even hotter than yesterday, and 
; I've got a bit of work to finish before returning to the FOTD 
; CD, which should be ready for distribution by the end of summer. 
; But the end of summer is still over 2-1/2 months away, and 
; before then we'll have many more fractals added to the ever-
; growing list.  The next fractal will appear on July 4.  Until 
; then, take care, and digress but don't egress.
