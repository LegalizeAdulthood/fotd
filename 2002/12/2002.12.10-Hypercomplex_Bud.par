; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I see that the existence of triternions has been noticed.  I had 
; not seen them mentioned until Tim mentioned them in his recent 
; letter, though I had assumed that they did exist and were less 
; well-known mainly because they are less useful than quaternions.
; 
; Three-part numbers would draw a three-dimensional Mandelbrot set 
; and a six-dimensional Julibrot.  But I wonder whether they would 
; actually create new Mandelbrot material.  The Quaternions and 
; Hypercomplex numbers draw interesting Julia sets, but merely 
; expand and distort the Mandelbrot set, introducing little if any 
; actual new material.  This might be due to the nature of the 
; M-sets or it might be due to the way they are implemented in the 
; program.  I question the implementation because the Julia 
; versions of the hyper-sets have 6 parameters, while the Mandel 
; versions have only 2 working parameters.
; 
; The quaternions draw a figure resembling the 3-D figure that 
; would appear if the M-set were rotated around its X-axis.  This 
; figure, which basically consists of circles, can then be sliced 
; through any of its parts, but the result is always a stretched 
; and distorted version of the same Mandelbrot set that we know 
; and love.  The Hypercomplex M-set appears as two separate sets 
; that overlap.  Some interesting things happen where the two sets 
; intersect, but once again, no new material is created.
; 
; Perhaps the triternions would create a M-set with new material 
; to explore, perhaps not.  I rather suspect the latter, though it 
; would be most interesting to actually try it and find out.
; 
; Several years ago, bored with the sameness, I wrote a generaliza-
; tion of the Hypercomplex formula that does create new material.  
; I have never been convinced that this new material is real 
; rather than an artifact of mathematical imprecision, but it 
; exists in a consistent way that would imply that it is indeed 
; real.
; 
; Today's image, which was created with this formula, and rather 
; resembles a skewed gothic window with converging bars before it, 
; has been named "Hypercomplex Bud".  I gave it this name because 
; it is a bud in the Hypercomplex Mandelbrot set unlike anything 
; that appears in the familiar complex M-set.  Not only is the 
; image unique on the surface, but its inner details are surpris-
; ingly complex -- more intricate than anything that appears in 
; the traditional M-set.  I will show some of this incredible 
; inner richness in tomorrow's FOTD.
; 
; I had to rate today's image at an average 5.  Its mathematical 
; interest is above average, but its artistic merit is below.  My 
; alibi, as always, is lack of time.  If I had more time, I could 
; have found a better color palette.
; 
; With a render time of 2/3 hour on my machine, the parameter file 
; is a slow one.  A far better way of viewing the scene is to 
; download the finished GIF file from the internet and Paul's site 
; at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Monday was sunny but cold here at F.C.  With snow on the ground 
; and a temperature that never reached freezing, (it stopped at 
; 28F -2C), the dynamic duo of fractal cats spent the day huddled 
; by the heat.  Late in the afternoon, a treat of turkey eased 
; their distress, and consequently my distress also.
; 
; As is usually the case, I find myself with several non-fractal 
; tasks to accomplish before setting out on my fractal journey of 
; the day.  This is a certain sign that I must now get busy.  So 
; until next time in 24 hours, take care, and when you walk with 
; fractals, don't expect much conversation.
