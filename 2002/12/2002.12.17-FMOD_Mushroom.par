; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is another venture into the strange fmod world of 
; yesterday's image.  True, the parameters have changed a little, 
; but the effect is the same.  The fmod fill normally draws bubble-
; like shapes.  It has no right to draw things like the nest of 
; Sierpinski triangles that appears in today's image.
; 
; But the image does not lie -- the shapes are there.  Maybe the 
; unusually high proximity setting of 8.5 is responsible for the 
; madness.  I don't know the answer, but after the holidays I will 
; certainly do more investigation into this phenomenon.
; 
; I must also work out a method of coloring these images.  The 
; all-or-nothing palette I used in today's image is the best I 
; could find so far, but there are many things I have not yet 
; tried.
; 
; The many artistic shortcomings of today's image drag its rating 
; down to a 4.  This less-than-average artistic rating is somewhat 
; offset by the mathematical potential that lies in the image.
; 
; I have named the picture "FMOD Mushroom".  A quick glance will 
; show why I chose this name.  The render time of 11 minutes can 
; be avoided by downloading the completely-rendered GIF file from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Monday was sunny, and the temperature reached an unexpected high 
; of 46F 8C, but the winds were far too high for outdoor comfort.  
; After a brief time sitting on the porch, the dynamic duo decided 
; to pass the afternoon indoors next to their favorite radiators.
; 
; And I'm going to pass this day working and preparing for the 
; holiday season and all the marginally necessary activities that 
; accompany it.  Until next time, take care, and prepare.
