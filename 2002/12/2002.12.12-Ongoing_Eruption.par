; FOTD -- December 12, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Fire and brimstone fill today's image, as an erupting fractal 
; volcano on the left spews its fiery ejecta high into the 
; atmosphere and over the cliff at the right edge of the frame.  
; In the cloud of debris near the right edge lies a tiny object 
; resembling a midget M-set.  The resemblance is only superficial, 
; for at the odd angle of today's image, no midgets are possible.
; 
; The image is an odd slice of the open rectangle that appears in 
; the C=-1.7435,0.0 Julia set of the Z^2.003+C fractal at Z coordi-
; nates 0.00019,0.07388.  This unexpected and near perfect rectan-
; gle is one of my favorite fractal objects, one to which I often 
; return.  Its actual four-dimensional shape would appear to a 4-D 
; person as a 2-D hole, with two extended dimensions and the 
; remaining two dimensions very small, much as a sheet of paper in 
; our 3-D world has two extended dimensions and one small 
; dimension.
; 
; Since two of its four dimensions are so small, this open area 
; appears as a rectangle only when sliced in the Julia direction 
; and at the exact C coordinates.  The slightest rotation or 
; imag(C) deviation totally destroys its straight edges and sur-
; rounding symmetry.  At today's angle, the symmetry is totally 
; destroyed.
; 
; I named the image "Firefall" because, with a little imagination, 
; it shows fire spewing from the ground and falling over a cliff.  
; Others may see something else, but the falling fire is all I can 
; see.  The rating presented little problem.  The slightly-above-
; average 6 seems just right.
; 
; The image is a fast one, requiring only 2-1/4 minutes to render 
; from the parameter file, on my worn-out machine.  About the same 
; time will be required to go online and download the completed 
; GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Freezing rain, followed by heavy rain and melting snow brought 
; flooding, fallen trees, power outages, and a roof leak to the 
; Fractal Central area Wednesday.  By evening, the high tempera-
; ture of 36F 2C had melted most of the ice that had built up on 
; trees and sidewalks.  Conditions were so bad outdoors that the 
; intrepid cats were thankful to be permitted to remain indoors 
; all day.  The roof leak will require further investigation.
; 
; Today is starting much improved, but I expect a lot of work 
; before the day is finished, which might cut into my fractal 
; time.  To see how things work out, check back here in 24 hours, 
; when the next FOTD will appear almost by magic.  Until then, 
; take care, and beware of fractal brimstone.
