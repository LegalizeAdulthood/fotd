; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image catches one of those Mandelbrot midgets at an 
; angle where it is most distorted.  The actual midget can be seen 
; by checking the M-set at the coordinates of (p4) of today's 
; image.  At the angle of today's slice, little is left of the 
; hole, which once was the midget and now lies invisibly at the 
; center of the image, or even of the basin itself, for that 
; matter.
; 
; At this angle, the basin appears to have split into two 
; branches, though actually it is the angle of the slice that 
; creates the split, cutting the single curved basin in two 
; places.  The surrounding areas of chaos, which somewhat resemble 
; comets, are far better defined in the M-set.
; 
; I named the picture "Passion Flower".  At one time I thought I 
; saw a flower blossom somewhere in the scene, though the bloom is 
; now far less apparent.  I rated the image at an average 5, which 
; is all I could do for it.  (The corresponding midget, which 
; appears in the M-set, would rate a 6 or 7.)
; 
; With a 3-1/2 minute render time, the parameter file is one way 
; of viewing the scene.  A more efficient way is to download the 
; completed GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Today's image is a slice of the four-dimensional Julibrot.  The 
; Julibrot cannot be accurately considered an object, because 
; objects are things that exist objectively in the objective 
; world, and to our specialized senses at least, the objective 
; world is three dimensional.
; 
; I have spent many years trying to visualize a four-dimensional 
; hyper-object, knowing all the while that my effort was futile.  
; The greatest problem is that the surface boundary of a 4-D 
; figure must be three-dimensional, and my imagination invariably 
; produces flat two-dimensional bounding surfaces for all my 
; mental figures.
; 
; A 4-D hyper-object must have on its bounding outer surface as 
; many dimensions as there are altogether in our space.  On the 
; 3-D surface of a 4-D planet, there would be six cardinal 
; directions.  Three parameters would be needed to fix a location, 
; and two parameters would be necessary to define a direction.  
; The horizon would not be a circle, but a sphere that totally 
; surrounds and encloses a visitor from the third dimension, as 
; the heavens surround the planet Earth.
; 
; On such a world, the sunrise would first appear as a brightening 
; concentrated in a particular area.  Then a brilliant star-like 
; dot would suddenly pop into existence at the brightest point, 
; grow to the familiar blinding disk, then shrink again to a dot 
; and vanish.  At sunset the same thing would occur at another 
; point of the field of view.
; 
; At night, assuming perfect clarity of the atmosphere, the stars 
; would appear as twinkling fireflies as they rose above and sank 
; beneath the horizon, passing through the 3-D visitor's field of 
; view.  The view on a 4-D world would be interesting indeed -- 
; provided, that is, that the visitor could find a way to shield 
; his retinas from light from the side, and also a way to avoid 
; crumpling into a wrinkled heap as a 2-D sheet of plastic wrap 
; does in our 3-D world.
; 
; It snowed at a moderate rate all day Thursday here at F.C., 
; piling up 8in 20cm by the time it ended at 11pm.  Combined with 
; a temperature of 27F -3C, the conditions proved far too harsh 
; for the intrepid duo, who passed the day alternating between 
; the window and the radiator.  All things considered, their moods 
; were surprisingly cheery.
; 
; Unable to get out yesterday, I passed the day getting ahead in 
; the work.  As a result, after clearing the sidewalk, I will have 
; extra time this afternoon to devote to fractal hunting.  Hope-
; fully, I'll find something worthwhile.  Check back tomorrow to 
; see whether I actually find it.  Until then, take care, and 
; fractals can and do make life interesting.
