; FOTD -- December 08, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "Arcing".  My excuse is that the bluish 
; streaks surrounding the central area of activity could be 
; interpreted as a series of electric arcs.  The actual reason is 
; that I rather enjoy using the word, which regardless of how it 
; is spelled, never seems to be spelled correctly.
; 
; The presumed correct spelling is 'arcing', but spelled this way, 
; the word looks as if it should be pronounced 'arse-ing', which 
; more sensitive fractalists could take to mean something un-nice. 
; The spelling 'arking' looks as though it would be pronounced 
; correctly, but seems unrecognizable when seen on paper.  The 
; participial form of the word 'picnic' is 'picnicking', and this 
; word gives no trouble.  Why then can not the participial form of 
; the word 'arc' be spelled 'arcking'? . . . I guess it looks like 
; a mis-spelling of 'racking'.
; 
; This little side trip into the world of correct spelling is in 
; no way meant to divert attention from today's image, which is 
; rated well above yesterday's lowly 2, but still comes in at a 
; slightly-below-average 4.  The slit-like hole at the center is 
; actually a very odd slice of a midget that appears in the east 
; valley area of a larger midget that lies on a filament extending 
; from the northwest shore of the main bud of the M-set.
; 
; At this angle, the 2,4,8... series of elements has basically 
; disintegrated into a disorganized chaos, though the overall 
; pattern is still rather well defined.  A glance at the < tab > 
; screen will show that the image has been greatly stretched and 
; skewed to undo the inherent stretching and skewing of the scene. 
; Such stretching and skewing is an important part of examining 
; the odd slices of the Julibrot, where features in their natural 
; form are often stretched and twisted beyond recognition.
; 
; This natural stretching is an inevitable part of the odd slices. 
; It exists for mathematical reasons, one of which is that objects 
; appear far larger in the Julia aspect than in the Mandelbrot 
; aspect, and the odd slices include parts of both aspects.  I 
; will have more to say about this stretching in a future FOTD.
; 
; Right now, it's time to reveal that, with a render time of 4 
; minutes, the image is barely worth the effort of rendering it 
; from the parameter file.  Those who choose not to render may 
; find the pre-rendered image ready for download on Paul's site 
; at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and on Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Saturday was sunny but chilly, with a 
; temperature barely above freezing.  The snow still on the ground 
; kept the dynamic ones safely indoors by their radiators.  But I 
; could not avoid a trip outdoors to do some things that needed to 
; be done.
; 
; This morning is sunny and chilly again.  I expect a similar day. 
; Until the next FOTD appears in 24 hours, take care, and see you 
; then.
