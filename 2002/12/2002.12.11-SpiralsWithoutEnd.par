; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal might show actual new material in the hypercom-
; plex Mandelbrot set, or it might be an artifact of mathematical 
; imprecision.  But regardless of what it is, it's an image with 
; spirals everywhere.  There are single spirals, double spirals, 
; even signs of triple spirals.  In fact, the image is filled with 
; spirals without end.  And "Spirals Without End" is what I named 
; it.
; 
; The image is a zoom into a hidden valley that appears peeking 
; between the converging straight arms of yesterday's "Hyperbud" 
; image, where a new world appears to be only partly revealing 
; itself.  In contrast to yesterday's image, which suffered from 
; resolution breakdown, today's image suffers from the near impos-
; sibility of finding an acceptable coloring.  I finally settled 
; on a very broad purplish palette, though the result still leaves 
; much to be desired and drops the rating to a below-average 3.
; 
; While fractaling, I sometimes wonder about the meaning of it 
; all.  Is the existence of fractals filled with a deep, as-yet-
; undiscovered meaning, perhaps about the nature of reality, or 
; are fractals mere candy for the eyes?  And what of the concept 
; of meaning itself?  Is it something invented by the highest 
; known form of life on the planet Earth, or is the universe 
; filled with it?  Does meaning actually exist before a self-aware 
; entity asks the question 'why'?  Does meaning exist on a two-
; mile-wide chunk of ice orbiting in the cold loneliness of the 
; Oort cloud, where observers never have and never shall venture 
; to ask 'why'?
; 
; And what of this fourth dimension with its hyper-objects?  We 
; can infer exactly how the various parts would fit together if it 
; existed, but even knowing these things, we cannot visualize some-
; thing as simple as a tesseract.  Does this mean that the fourth 
; dimension does not exist?  Does it mean that it does exist but 
; we cannot visualize it?  Does it mean that we have invented the 
; whole puzzle as a mental exercise?  Or does it mean anything at 
; all?
; 
; Don't expect answers any time soon.
; 
; And don't expect an image soon if you try to run today's para-
; meter file.  It takes 1-1/4 hours on my less-than-supersonic 
; P-200 machine.  The best way to see the puzzling image is to 
; download it from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:

;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Tuesday's fractal weather was cloudy and chilly here at F.C., 
; with a high temperature of 34F 1C.  The ex-dynamic duo passed 
; the unsatisfactory day lounging by the heat, except for when 
; they were asking for food.
; 
; This morning has brought freezing rain, which is even worse.  
; It's a good day to remain indoors and get ahead on some work.  
; Until tomorrow, when things will hopefully be more pleasant, 
; take care, and try to make the best of bad situations as they 
; arise.
