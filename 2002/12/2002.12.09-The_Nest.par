; FOTD -- December 09, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Well, fractal persistence paid off, and I finally found an image 
; worthy of an above-average rating.  True, it's only a slightly-
; above-average rating of 6, but it's still an above-average 
; rating, and that's all that matters.
; 
; I might have rated the image higher if it had been something I 
; found rather than created with the < epsiloncross > inside fill 
; feature of Fractint.  But let's not quibble -- an above-average 
; image is an above-average image, and I needed an above-average 
; image.  (Having repeated the phrase 'above average' a sufficient 
; number of times, I shall mention it no more.)
; 
; The expression (-Z)^(1.5)+C was iterated to draw the fractal.  
; Iterating -Z instead of Z merely reveals a different part of the 
; infinite complex logarithmic spiral.  The 'SliceJB-new-min' 
; formula is a slight reworking of a formula that was posted to 
; the list several years ago by John Goering.
; 
; Today's image is an oblique slice of the -Z^1.5+C Julibrot.  
; The slice is oriented rather close to the Julia direction, which 
; is revealed when (p1) and (p2) are set to 0.5,0.5.  I named the 
; image "The Nest" when it reminded me of some crazy bird's nest.  
; With its effect of being illuminated from behind, the image 
; could just as easily been named something inspirational such as 
; "Crown of Thorns".
; 
; The 'SliceJB-new-min' formula draws more rotations than any 
; other formula in my vast and partly forgotten collection, but it 
; does not draw every possible rotation in four dimensions.  
; Finding a formula that does this is still one of my quests.
; 
; The render time of 18 seconds is blazingly fast, but the down-
; load of the completed image is still available at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Sunday was pleasant enough, with hazy sun, 
; gentle breezes, and a temperature of 48F 9C.  The problem was 
; that the snow turned wet and slushy -- far too unpleasant for 
; the cats' tender paws.  They once again passed the day keeping 
; warm and wishing they could get outside to play.
; 
; This morning the snow has re-frozen and is dry, but the tempera-
; ture is well below freezing -- far too chilly for the intrepid 
; ones.  Having a pile of work to think about, I shall give the 
; cold little notice -- that is unless some reason arises that I 
; must wander outdoors.  Until the next FOTD appears in 24 hours, 
; keep warm or cool, whatever the case may be, and keep your 
; fractals dry.
