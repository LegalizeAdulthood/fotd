; FOTD -- December 13, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today is Friday the 13th here at Fractal Central.  Am I worried 
; about bad luck?  Not in the slightest.  I doubt that bad luck 
; exists.  What passes as bad luck is probably nothing more than 
; normal statistical variation.  But I admit that fate seems 
; against me during those spells when, regardless of how long and 
; hard I search, I can't find a good fractal anywhere.
; 
; With its rating of 6, today's fractal is leaning toward good, 
; but closer to average.  In yesterday's FOTD discussion I told of 
; a curious rectangular hole in one of the Julia sets of the 
; Z^2.003+C fractal.  Today's image shows that rectangle, not in 
; its pure form, but slightly distorted by a double rotation.  I 
; have also added interest by filling the open area with < fmod > 
; inside fill.
; 
; The result looks rather artificial, even unreal.  It appears to 
; have been assembled from several fractals, which is why I named 
; it "An Unreal Object".  The entire image gives the impression of 
; a surreal bird flying toward outer space, moving so rapidly 
; through the atmosphere that it is actually ionizing the air as 
; it moves through.  The violet glow surrounding the bird-like 
; shape could be a result of this ionization.
; 
; I almost named the picture "Sunbird" after an old computer 
; animation of a bird in space, flying beyond earth on its way to 
; the sun.  When viewing this short animation, I have always 
; wondered how a bird can maneuver in the vacuum of space, with 
; nothing to beat its wings against.  Well, if those space 
; fighters in the "Star Wars" series can do impossible things like 
; turning and banking in a vacuum, why not a bird?
; 
; The four odd perpendicular aspects of this area each have their 
; unique features, and the odd oblique slices also hold some inter-
; esting scenery.  But none are as interesting as the Mandelbrot 
; and especially the Julia aspects.
; 
; In its Mandelbrot aspect, today's scene is located in the East 
; Valley area of the prominent midget on the main stem of its 
; parent fractal.  But in this parent fractal, created by Z^2.003, 
; the main stem, including the East Valley of the midget, has 
; started to split apart, revealing some entirely new material, 
; including a curious tiny bay right on the X-axis.
; 
; To see the 'unreal' bird that in today's image flies into space, 
; boot Fractint and run the attached parameter file.  After a wait 
; of 7 minutes, the bird will be in full view, violet aura and 
; all.  Or the wait can be avoided by downloading the pre-rendered 
; GIF image from the internet at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Thursday was a cloudy day here at F.C.  The temperature of 45F 
; 7C was reasonable enough, but the combination of snow and mud 
; in the yard kept the fractal cats confined to the porch.  Their 
; moods were surprisingly pleasant considering the situation.  
; Today is once again cloudy, with rain threatening.  It remains 
; to be seen how the dynamic duo will pass the day.  
; 
; I know how I'll pass my day -- keeping busy.  And at 11:15am, 
; it's already past the time to start.  So until next FOTD, take 
; care, and keep fractaling.
