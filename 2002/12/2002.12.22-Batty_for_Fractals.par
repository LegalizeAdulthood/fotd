; FOTD -- December 22, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image comes as close to true-color as is possible with 
; only 256 colors.  The iteration bands are still there, but one 
; must look carefully indeed to see them.  And no, I did not spend 
; hours working on this illusion.  It happened by accident as I 
; was rotating the palette.
; 
; I named the image "Batty for Fractals" because the dark objects 
; in the foreground remind me of baseball bats.  The generating 
; formula is named "BackwardBrot" because instead of raising Z to 
; the power of a number, it raises a number to the power of a 
; power of Z.  I wrote the formula many years ago, well before I 
; started the FOTD, back in the days when I was an intrepid 
; fractal explorer exploring alone where no one had gone before.
; 
; I am still a fractal explorer, and always shall be, but as the 
; world of fractals has become more familiar, I no longer need to 
; be as intrepid as I once was.  The sense of adventure is still 
; there however, and as long as unseen things remain in the world 
; of fractals, I shall seek to find them.
; 
; Partly because of its illusion of true color, which might depend 
; on the adjustment of the individual monitor, today's image rates 
; a 6.  Perhaps its best feature is its incredibly fast render 
; time of 48 seconds, which is likely due to the fact that its 
; magnitude is in the default range.
; 
; The completed GIF image may be found on the W.W.W. at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; With a temperature of 55F 13C, Saturday turned out to be better 
; than expected here at F.C.  After starting with lots of clouds, 
; it turned sunny and mild by noon.  Too bad that the holly trees 
; blocked most of the sun from reaching the yard, where the 
; dynamic duo spent almost two hours exploring.  I fail to see how 
; one's own yard can be so unknown that it needs to be explored, 
; but then I am not a cat, and cats live in a different world.
; 
; Now I must give the bad news that I had hoped to avoid.  With 
; the holidays so close, things are getting so hectic here at F.C. 
; that for the next few days I will be unable to find the time for 
; fractal exploration.  As a result, today's FOTD will be the last 
; until this coming Saturday, December 28.  But I am not losing 
; enthusiasm for fractals -- I can't imagine that happening -- I 
; merely will not have the spare time to sit at the computer and 
; explore.  Until Saturday then, take care, and I'll still be 
; checking the lists every day.
