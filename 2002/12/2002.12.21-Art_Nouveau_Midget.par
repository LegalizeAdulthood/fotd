; FOTD -- December 21, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; December is supposed to be a month without quadratic midgets.  
; This does not mean it is a month without near-quadratic midgets 
; however.  The midget at the center of today's image has in 
; itself small imperfections that indicate it was generated by the 
; formula Z^2.003+C rather than Z^2+C, so the quadratic-midget-
; free month continues.
; 
; If yesterday's image had a bit of an art-nouveau feel about it, 
; today's image looks like it came right out of 1898.  What could 
; I name it other than "Art-Nouveau Midget"?
; 
; The image was generated by the MandelbrotBC1 formula, which 
; calculated the parent fractal as it appears 1050 levels up the 
; logarithmic spiral, where it is rotated 180 degrees, causing the 
; negative X-axis split to fall on East Valley, which is now on 
; the west side of the origin.  I needed to go up 1050 levels 
; because with the exponent so close to 2, the fractal changes 
; very slowly as we depart from ground level.
; 
; Today's arty scene is located in an area of fractured chaos at 
; the edge of its parent's rotated East (or West) Valley, which is 
; just starting to broaden and split.  This area holds a horde of 
; other midgets, many of which might be far better than today's.  
; But it would take forever to track down all of them, and I have 
; little time to spare.
; 
; The image rates a 6, which is a little above average.  It 
; renders in 11 minutes, which is a little below average.  And it 
; downloads from the FOTD web sites in around one minute, which 
; is always average.  Those web sites may be accessed at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Friday began mild and showery here at Fractal Central, but 
; around midday the rain stopped, the breeze picked up and the sun 
; appeared.  The unusually warm temperature of 57F 14C lured the 
; cats into the yard even before the grass, or what is left of it, 
; had completely dried.  By the end of the day their moods were 
; actually pleasant enough to bring purrs.
; 
; For me, the heavy work continues uninterrupted.  And I also have 
; a number of gifts yet to find.  It's looking like I may have to 
; miss a few days' FOTD's next week, but at least tomorrow's will 
; appear on schedule.  Until then, take care, and a fractal a day 
; is one of the best ways to keep off that extra weight.
