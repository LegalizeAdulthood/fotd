; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I am sometimes asked, 'where is the fourth dimension located?'  
; It is not an easy question to answer.  The first answer that 
; comes to mind is the intuitive common-sense reply that the 
; fourth dimension does not exist.  It cannot exist because our 
; space has only three dimensions, with no room in it for an extra 
; dimension.  But science has long since passed beyond the realm 
; of common-sense, and such an answer can no longer be considered 
; the final word.
; 
; Almost 100 years ago the theory of relativity appeared on the 
; scene, which treats time as a fourth dimension.  But taking time 
; as a fourth dimension is not very satisfying.  We want an extra 
; spatial dimension, a space in which time would be the fifth 
; dimension.  The fact that time is handled differently mathemati-
; cally is an admission that time is not the new dimension we seek.
; 
; When studying the world of the very tiny, Physicists sometimes 
; work with what is known as 'Hilbert Space'.  This space can have 
; as many dimensions as necessary, but it is more a mathematical 
; abstraction than a physical reality.  Hilbert space cannot serve 
; as the extra dimension.
; 
; In the 1980's the idea of superstrings burst upon the scene.  
; These infinitesimal things are supposed to lead the way to a 
; theory of almost everything.  They are assumed to exist in 10 or 
; 11 dimensions, with their vibrations manifesting in our space as 
; the various sub-atomic particles.  But the extra dimensions are 
; now so tiny that they lie far beyond the range of observation.  
; And even if a way were found to actually observe the hidden 
; dimensions, we could do nothing more than take a measurement 
; that told us that the dimensions were really there.  With our 
; two-dimensional retinas and three-dimensional-trained minds, we 
; could never observe the extra dimensions.
; 
; Yet four-dimensional objects do exist mathematically.  The 4-D 
; Julibrot is really there in math-space, appearing objectively 
; identical to all who study it.  With our computers we can slice 
; it in any direction desired and study the slices.  We can study 
; the six perpendicular planes and the four perpendicular three-
; spaces that exist in 4-D space.  Yet, despite this ability, we 
; still cannot visualize the fourth dimension nor a 4-D object as 
; simple as a hypercube.
; 
; The limitation is apparently in our visual apparatus and minds.  
; Living in a universe of perhaps infinite dimensions, we can 
; visually observe only 3 of them.  And this limitation assures 
; that regardless of how hard we try, we shall never visualize 
; even one extra spatial dimension.  But if the fourth dimension 
; actually did exist, in which direction would it lie?
; 
; When asked this question, I reply that the way to the fourth 
; dimension is sideways to the insides of solid objects.  If a 
; point were to start at the center of a sphere and move perpendi-
; cularly into the fourth dimension, the point would not move 
; toward any point on the surface of the sphere.  It would dis-
; appear at once from the center of the sphere, and move away from 
; it, remaining at the same distance from all points on the 
; sphere's surface.
; 
; Of course, to our 3-D-trained minds living in 3-D space, this 
; seems impossible, and in three-space it is impossible, but in 
; four-space it is only one of the many apparently impossible 
; things that can happen.  I'll have much more to say about four-
; dimensional curiosities in the upcoming FOTD's.
; 
; And before I forget, we do have a fractal.  Today's average-
; rated fractal is a scene in the Oblate direction of the Julibrot 
; created by the formula Z^(-2.5)+Z+C.  I have named it "Training 
; Oblates" because of the train of indescribable open areas lined 
; in a straight diagonal line.  Once again the straight theme 
; appears in an odd slice.  I will explain this curiosity also in 
; a soon-to-appear FOTD.
; 
; The render time of just under 4 minutes is slightly slow for an 
; average image.  Downloading the completed GIF file from the

; will be a bit more convenient.
; 
; Monday was cloudy and chilly here at F.C.  The temperature of 
; 45F 7C was not too extreme, but for some reason the dynamic duo 
; of fractal cats chose to remain indoors by the heat source.  Not 
; one to interrupt a good thing, I let them sleep most of the 
; afternoon.
; 
; Today promises to be sunnier, but also blustery and much colder. 
; It will likely be another indoor day for the intrepid ones.  For 
; me it will be another work day, and if I hope to finish, I must 
; begin.  Until tomorrow, same time same place, take care, and 
; always look to the fractal side.
