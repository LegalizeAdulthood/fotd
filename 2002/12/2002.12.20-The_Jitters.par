; FOTD -- December 20, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's FOTD I unpacked a formula named MytestAF.  I have no 
; idea what the name means or what the formula is supposed to do.  
; I wrote it one day a number of years ago when I was inventing 
; formulas (formulae for the over-educated) at random, hoping for 
; a lucky break.  But the lucky break never happened, and the 
; formula was consigned to one of my abandoned formula files, 
; where it has languished for 6 years or so.
; 
; On Thursday, after being dead all that time, the formula was 
; chosen at random and given one last chance.  It seized the 
; chance and created an image that, rating a 5, barely made it 
; onto the honor roll of FOTD images.
; 
; It is a busy, jittery looking image, which is why I named it 
; "The Jitters".  The foreground is filled with curved bits of 
; brilliantly blue debris that arranges itself into yellowish 
; angular masses as it fades into the background.  This background 
; debris is just that -- debris.  When enlarged, it does nothing, 
; and goes on apparently forever doing nothing.  It lacks even the 
; curvilinear, art-nouveau-like, feeling of the foreground.
; 
; On my nearly-extinct machine the attached parameter file runs in 
; 2-1/2 minutes.  On a real 'screamer' it will run in a minute or 
; so.  The completed image will download in less than a minute 
; from one of the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; But, for those who are not always connected, another minute or 
; so will be spent going online and reaching the sites.  Since all 
; means of viewing the image are about equal in time spent, it is 
; up to the individual fractalist to decide which route to take.
; 
; Well, the holiday season is almost here -- the darkest time of 
; year in the northern hemisphere, when I am most prone to wax 
; philosophic about many things, but the shortcomings of science 
; and technology in particular.  And when I do such waxing, I 
; usually get myself into a lively debate with those who feel that 
; science might be threatened and needs to be defended.  Luckily 
; for members of the Fractint list, if the philosophizing starts, 
; I will confine it to the philofractal list, where it will be 
; on-topic for anyone who might still be there to listen.
; 
; Thursday continued the cloudy, chilly, damp weather here at 
; F.C., with a temperature barely reaching 40F 4C.  Seeing such 
; conditions, the cats were no happier than they had been the 
; Wednesday before.
; 
; As for me, I have much work to do and little time in which to do 
; it, and the new work keeps coming in.  I hope to keep the FOTD 
; going every day through the holidays, but it is by no means 
; certain that I will be able to do so.  Tomorrow's fractal will 
; appear on schedule however.  After that we'll have to take it a 
; day at a time.  Until next FOTD, take care, and, if possible, be 
; cheerful until the holidays are past.
