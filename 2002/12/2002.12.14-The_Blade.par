; FOTD -- December 14, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With much shopping to get done before the day ends, I will have 
; to make today's FOTD discussion a fast one.
; 
; Today's image pictures an enigma.  "How can it be like that?" I 
; ask myself as I study the image, which combines both Julia and 
; Mandelbrot features of the (-Z)^2.003+C Julibrot.
; 
; The scene is located in the East Valley area of the large midget 
; on the split-up main stem of its parent.  The outer part of the 
; image is in the shape of a slightly distorted typical-East-
; Valley Julia set.  Since the direction of the slice is slightly 
; rotated from the exact Julia orientation, this distortion is to 
; be expected.  But the outer almost-Julia set is filled with the 
; grossly stretched and enlarged apparition of the East Valley of 
; the Mandelbrot midget itself.
; 
; I do not know how it can be like this.  It is a mystery.  How 
; can one look through an open Julia set and see an enlarged part 
; of the Mandelbrot set?  I know well enough how the numbers work 
; to create the four-dimensional whole, but to picture that four-
; dimensional whole is as impossible to me as knowing the future 
; or changing the past.  I can comprehend it; I cannot see it.
; 
; This mystery, this enigma, is what keeps me fascinated with 
; fractals.  To be so close to visualizing, yet stopped by my 
; natural limits is frustrating, but at the same time, fascina-
; ting.  Reading the books written by others who share my frustra-
; tion leads me to realize that the future is hopeless.  Neither I 
; nor anyone else shall visualize a four-dimensional object as it 
; exists in its entirety in its own space at a single moment of 
; time.  And if anyone were to actually visualize something as 
; simple as even a hypercube, that person could do no more than 
; describe the arrangement of its parts -- a thing that we already 
; know.  The visualization would be impossible to communicate.
; 
; I named today's image "The Blade".  The distorted greenish 
; object visible in the open area does resemble a blade.  I rated 
; the image at a 5, which is average.  The render time of 3-3/4 
; minutes is also about average.  And for those who would rather 
; not render, the completed image can be found at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and downloaded from there.
; 
; The rain arrived at 1pm on Friday, and fell steadily for the 
; rest of the day.  Despite the chilly temperature of 39F 4C, the 
; fractal cats managed just enough outdoor time before the rain 
; began to keep them happy until evening.
; 
; This morning is once again threatening rain, and I can no longer 
; put off the shopping that is unnecessary yet necessary at this 
; time of year.  But this evening, when the running around is 
; behind me, I'll turn once again to fractals and the worlds that 
; numbers create.  Look for the next fractal in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and don't be too busy to enjoy the day.
