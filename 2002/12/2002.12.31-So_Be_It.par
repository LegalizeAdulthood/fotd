; FOTD -- December 31, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's FOTD we end the year by returning to the 
; MandelbrotMix4 formula and visiting the fractal created when 4.1 
; parts of Z^(-7.5) are added to 7.7 parts of Z^(-1.5).  To make 
; things even more interesting, we then add (1/C) rather than just 
; straight C.
; 
; The resulting fractal consists of a short string of bays with 
; many spurious sub-bays and valleys.  Today's scene lies in an 
; unlikely part of a spiral in an unpromising area in the south-
; west corner of the parent fractal.  I found it more by instinct 
; than logic.  In fact, I rarely use logic when searching for 
; fractals -- it takes too much of the fun and surprise out of the 
; search.
; 
; I named the image "So Be It".  The name has nothing to do with 
; the appearance of the fractal.  It expresses the mood that comes 
; over me every year at this time, when another year passes 
; irretrievably into the past.  (which too many have already done)
; 
; The image consists of a central midget surrounded by a ring of 
; silk ribbons.  Beyond the silky ring lies a dark mysterious area 
; filled with somber purplish bows.  The whole thing is a bit on 
; the depressing side, and can be rated no higher than a 6.  But a 
; 6 is still above average, so the 14 minutes spent rendering the 
; image from the parameter file will not be a total waste of time. 
; And even the 14 minute wait can be avoided by visiting one of 
; the FOTD web sites and downloading the finished image from there.

; 
; Monday brought a repeat of Sunday's weather to F.C., with sun, 
; clouds, light breezes, and a temperature of 44F 6.5C, which was 
; pleasant for humans but not pleasant enough for dynamic fractal 
; cats.  The duo's moods turned sulky as the afternoon progressed 
; and the mud in the yard remained undried.
; 
; As for myself, I expect a pleasant enough day.  The non-fractal 
; work is nearly finished, leaving me little to do for the rest of 
; the day but keep my eye on the cats, search for fractals, and 
; finish reading my latest issue of 'Skeptical Inquirer' magazine, 
; a publication by skeptics for skeptics, whose purpose is to pro-
; mote reason and reassure the concerned members of the skeptical 
; community that the paranormal and the supernatural do not exist.
; 
; Unfortunately for those whose world would come crashing down if 
; the paranormal were shown to be true, things that cannot be ex-
; plained rationally actually do happen, and have happened to me, 
; (particularly in the week preceding 9-11-01), which is why I no 
; longer consider the articles in SI magazine to be the final word 
; on the subject.  But it is still an informative magazine, which 
; is fun to read.  And, being party-poopers, the authors are used 
; to being kicked around by those who want to believe.
; 
; Once again, I have managed to escape the silliness that happens 
; at midnight every year on this date.  Instead of going out and 
; acting silly, I'll sit by my fractal TV and watch others act 
; silly.  Until next year, which will be here sooner than one 
; might expect, take care, and bide your time with a search for 
; fractals.
