; FOTD -- December 28, 2002 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Somehow, I once again survived the first and biggest of the two 
; seasonal holidays.  (Is it politically correct to use the word 
; 'Christmas'?)  The tree was lovely, the turkey dinner delicious, 
; the presents were exchanged peacefully, the conversation was not 
; controversial, and most importantly, the fractal cats concealed 
; their bad moods.  All this pleasantness left me in a highly-
; charged fractal-finding mode.  (Fractals are really not hard to 
; find.)  The fractal I found appears as today's FOTD image.
; 
; The formula I used is an old one, which has been lying dormant 
; for many years and which for some forgotten reason I had named 
; 'cascade'.  As is the case with most of these old formulae, I 
; have totally forgotten what it was originally intended to do.  
; (Why do I neglect to add comments?)  The formula appears to have 
; some vague relation to the mysterious 'Ikenaga' function, though 
; I wrote it at least one year before I began working with the 
; 'Ikenaga' function.
; 
; The image that I found, with its rating of a very impressive 9, 
; is one of the best of the year.  Like so many works of art that 
; unfold in time, the 2002 series of FOTD images has reached its 
; peak near its end.
; 
; I named the image "Cascade of Bubbles".  I chose this name when 
; I noticed that the bof60 bubbles appear to be cascading down 
; into the depths of the picture.  This cascading effect might be 
; what inspired the original name of the formula, which, unlike 
; most of my formulae, has no variable parameters.  There are as 
; many holly leaves as bubbles in the image, all cascading 
; downward, but bubbles are more poetic, so I chose the bubbles.
; 
; The image renders in exactly 4 minutes on my machine, accurate 
; to 1/100 of a second.  There is nothing unusual in this time.  
; It is simply a coincidence.  After all, a time of exactly 4 
; minutes has just as much chance of coming up as a time such as 
; 0:04:16.37.
; 
; The 4-minute render-time wait can be cut by more than half by 
; downloading the finished GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; It was a cold week here at Fractal Central, with 4 inches of 
; snow on Christmas day giving the first white Christmas in 33 
; years.  Needless to say, the dynamic duo of fractal cats 
; disapproved of such conditions and needed several treats of 
; left-over turkey to soothe their ruffled tempers.
; 
; As for me, I somehow have managed to get almost all the work 
; caught up, and find myself with little to do but search for the 
; next fractal, which will appear in 24 hours.  It will be hard to 
; find one that equals or exceeds today's image, but I'll try.  
; Check tomorrow to see if I succeed.  Until then, take care and 
; relax.
