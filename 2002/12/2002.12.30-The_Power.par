; FOTD -- December 30, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I first saw today's scene, which lies deep in the 
; Mandelbrot set, it reminded me of something that I could not 
; place.  Then I noticed the eight straight sword-like features 
; radiating from the central midget, and thought of the power-
; swords of the 'Star Wars' series.  In a moment of inspiration 
; I named the image "The Power".
; 
; As I recall, the actual swords glowed greenish and didn't appear 
; until they were needed for combat.  But today's image comes just 
; barely close enough to justify the name.  Since it is merely 
; another scene in the M-set, and something that has been seen 
; many times before, I could rate it no higher than a 4.  Hope-
; fully, tomorrow's FOTD will close the year in a better manner.
; 
; The render time of 17 minutes can be avoided by downloading the 
; pre-rendered GIF file from:

; 
; or from:

;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; I see in the news that claims of the birth of the first human 
; clone are circulating.  The questions that are raised by the 
; possibility are truly interesting, and will give me much 
; philofractal material to ponder in the days to come.
; 
; The weather here at Fractal Central on Sunday was of the fractal 
; variety -- some sun, some clouds, little breeze, and a tempera-
; ture of 46F 8C, which is somewhat above normal.  The cats were 
; somewhat happy with the conditions in the yard, especially with 
; the drying mud, but it's still quite muddy down in the holly 
; thicket, so they avoided that area.
; 
; For me, it's back to normal work today, but I will always manage 
; to find time for fractals.  Until next FOTD, which will appear 
; in 24 hours, take care, and life is never dull as long as the 
; world has fractals and clones in it.
