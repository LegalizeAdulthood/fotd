; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows an odd slice of a midget that lies in the 
; East Valley area of the prominent midget on the main stem of the 
; M-set.  At this angle, the tiny open area at the center of the 
; image cannot be said to be a midget -- Julibrot holes appear as 
; midgets only when they are sliced in the Mandelbrot orientation 
; along a critical plane.  The orientation of the entire image is 
; so far removed from both the Julia and Mandelbrot directions 
; that the hole at its center appears as a mere slit.
; 
; Much of the distortion of the hole is caused by the extreme 
; stretching and skewing that was necessary to remove the inherent 
; distortion from the surrounding pattern.  The world of the odd 
; slices of the 4-D Julibrot is unlike the world of the M-sets or 
; the J-sets.  In the odd slices, the features twist, turn and 
; stretch in an unpredictable manner, and must be unstretched to 
; make reasonable pictures of them.  So the stretching that went 
; into today's image is actually an unstretching -- a stretching 
; in the opposite direction.
; 
; I named the final result "Fractal Trinity".  The brilliant white 
; triangle around the center slit reminds me of a religious symbol 
; that might be used to represent the Divine Trinity.  I'm not 
; trying to promote religion, but I have always wondered whether 
; fractals have a far deeper significance than mere candy for the 
; eyes and ears.  After all, fractals resemble the quantum world 
; of the very small, in that they both can be properly comprehen-
; ded only by the math that describes them.  And like fractals, 
; the world at the quantum level does not really come into exis-
; tence until we make a measurement (iterate a formula) and force 
; it to do something that we can comprehend.
; 
; Despite (or because of) its religious connotations, I could rate 
; today's image no higher than an average 5.  These distorted 
; Julibrot slices have a certain feeling of stress about them that 
; does not make for totally enjoyable viewing.  The render time of 
; just under 4 minutes is reasonable enough, but a download of the 
; completed image, which may be found at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; is even more reasonable.
; 
; The sun was strong on Sunday, but the high winds and tempera-
; tures barely above freezing (33F 0.5C) kept the dynamic cats 
; indoors all day.  Their moods were surprisingly pleasant however 
; as they chased the patches of sunlight streaming through the 
; windows.  Since they have never figured out which way the sun-
; light will move, they were only partly successful in keeping 
; themselves in the warm rays.
; 
; As for me, I know which way the sun will move, but I'm not sure 
; how the day's work will move, so I'd best take some action to 
; see that it moves in the right direction.  I'll return in 24 
; hours, more or less, still in the third dimension but talking 
; about the fourth.  Until then, take care, and follow the sun.
