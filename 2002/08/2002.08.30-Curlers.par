; FOTD -- August 30, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Checking my e-mail box this morning, I found 23 messages, 18 of 
; which were junk.  I am not particularly annoyed by this junk 
; mail, some of it is actually fun, especially those blatantly 
; scam letters from the families of assassinated leaders I have 
; never heard of in some unlikely African nations, who want to 
; give me 8-million U.S. dollars if I send them my bank account 
; number.  And there is also the "very excite game" family of 
; junk, which I have received hundreds of times, and delete 
; immediately because they contains a virus.
; 
; I simply delete most of this junk automatically.  This morning 
; however, when it took 20 minutes to download my queue of e-mail, 
; I realized that things might be getting a bit out of control.  
; I'm even getting undeliverable messages returned to me that I 
; never sent.  If the present trend continues, I might need to 
; change my e-mail address in the not-too-distant future.  But for 
; the present, I'll stick with the 6-year-old 'jamth' address.
; 
; Today's image existed for all eternity before I stumbled upon it 
; yesterday afternoon.  It is a scene in the fractal that results 
; when 0.1 part of Z^12 is subtracted from Z^1.2 and 1/C is added. 
; The fractal consists of a two-lobed Mandeloid with its main 
; filament curling off to the east.  The curl in this filament 
; inspired the name "Curlers".
; 
; Today's FOTD pictures a point far out on this curling filament, 
; where a tiny midget lurks.  Most of the impact comes from the 
; coloring, on which I spent a few extra minutes.  Thanks to the 
; strong colors, the image, which otherwise would have rated a 6, 
; rates a 7.
; 
; The parameter file is unusually fast, running in the one-minute 
; range on most machines.  It will probably take longer to go 
; online and download the completed GIF image file.  But for those 
; who will enjoy the trip, the completed image may be found online 
; at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Thursday here at Fractal Central was of the fractal 
; variety, as most everything in nature is, including the fractal 
; cats, who endured 2 outdoor hours of heavy clouds and a tempera-
; ture of 70F 21C before surrendering to their need for food and 
; coming in from the yard.
; 
; As for me, I'd best get busy doing the things that need to be 
; done here in the fractal shoppe.  And that means work.  So until 
; the next FOTD three days from now on Sept 2, take care, and be 
; of sound mind and nominally unsound fractals.
