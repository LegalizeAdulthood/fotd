; FOTD -- August 12, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal image, which rates a 7, is named "The Richest 
; Fractal".  Yes, I realize that the Mandelbrot set is in all 
; likelihood the overall richest fractal, but in the M-set (and 
; the Julia sets) it is not possible to illustrate much of the 
; overall variety in a single image.
; 
; However, in today's image, which is a scene in a valley of the 
; Z^1.555+C Mandelbrot fractal, much of the variety does appear in 
; a single picture.  This is possible because the branch cuts have 
; thoroughly scrambled the original fractal into an omelet of 
; which today's image is a small sample.
; 
; As is almost always the case in my FOTD fractals, there is a 
; midget at the center.  And there are midgets also lurking near 
; the top and bottom of the image.  This abundance of midgets is 
; quite unusual in this exponent range, and, combined with the 
; overall variety, makes the image one of the richest of all time. 
; The rating of 7 might be a bit liberal, but a liberal view makes 
; one feel better, so a rating of 7 it is.
; 
; Enjoy the fractal scene!
; 
; The render time on my tired old P200 machine is 9 minutes.  On a 
; state-of-the-art screamer it will be notably less, but not 
; 1/10th the time.  Apparently, the screaming machines with 10 
; times the cycles per second do less fractal calculation on each 
; cycle.  The wait-to-see can be reduced even further by visiting 
; the web site of Paul at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or of Scott at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and downloading the completed GIF image from there.  But allow a 
; few minutes for the image to be posted before visiting.
; 
; The fractal weather Sunday here at Fractal Central was typical 
; summer fare, with hazy sunshine, a temperature of 93F 34C, and 
; moderately high humidity.  The dynamic fractal duo passed the 
; day alternating between the cool indoors and the rather 
; uncomfortable (for humans) outdoors.
; 
; As for this human, he's about ready to pass the day changing the 
; work to be done into work done.  The task will take about 6 
; hours, so until next time, which will be on the 14th, take care, 
; and keep searching.
