; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in that great abstraction known as the 
; Julibrot.  The iterated formula is Z^2+C, which draws our old 
; friend the first fractal of all, the Mandelbrot set.  But the 
; same formula also draws a horde of Julia sets, which might have 
; come first, and though they are not as well known, a horde of 
; perturbed Mandelbrot sets can also be drawn by the simple 
; formula.  But wait, that is not all.  The Z^2+C formula also 
; draws families of sets which have no official names, though I 
; call them Oblate, Parabolic, Elliptic, and Rectangular sets.
; 
; These six families of fractals represent the six mutually 
; perpendicular orientations through the four-dimensional object 
; known as the Julibrot.  Yes, I realize that a four-dimensional 
; object is an absurdity.  Such an object could exist only in a 
; space of four dimensions, and a quick glance at the world shows 
; that there is no room for a fourth dimension.  Our three 
; familiar dimensions take up all the space that exists.  If 
; anyone doubts this, I challenge the doubter to go out to an open 
; area and point his arm to a direction that is not one of our 
; familiar 3-D directions.
; 
; Yet, the Julibrot figure does not know that it cannot exist, 
; because it is there and it will not go away.  I know it is there 
; because I can calculate and then see slices through it, and I 
; can rotate those slices in most any direction I desire.  Today's 
; image for example is one of a midget on a filament in the east 
; suburbs of the large midget at -1.75 on the negative stem of the 
; M-set.
; 
; But it does not look like a Mandelbrot midget.  Nor does it look 
; like a Julia set for that matter.  In fact, it is none of the 
; four other types of sets either.  It is a nothing set -- a slice 
; through the Julibrot at the point of the Mandelbrot midget, in a 
; totally oblique direction.  But sometimes, even nothing can be 
; something, and today's nothing set makes a picture which 
; contains much of the character of the Mandelbrot midget of which 
; it is an odd slice.
; 
; Because it is an odd slice of a Mandelbrot midget, I named the 
; image "Odd Mandelbrot"  The rating of a 5 seems about right, and 
; the render time of under one minute is certainly right.
; 
; As always, the completed GIF image ia available on the WWW at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Wednesday was almost perfect.  The blue 
; skies, gentle winds, and temperature of 80F 27C kept the fractal 
; duo outdoors for a good part of the day.  And when it was 
; finally time to return indoors, they did so reluctantly.
; 
; I now find myself with a moderate amount of work that needs to 
; be done.  Since it's always better to have work behind one 
; rather than before, I'll have to get the work behind me.  Until 
; next FOTD on Aug 10, take care, and prosper.
