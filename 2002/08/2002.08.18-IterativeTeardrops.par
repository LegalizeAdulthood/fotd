; ---------
; FOTD --  (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's Sunday mid-morning here at Fractal Central, and all is 
; well.  I have just finished emptying my e-mail box of two large 
; undeliverable e-mails that were returned to me.  This is well 
; enough, except for the fact that I never sent the letters in the 
; first place.  It's probably another virus, and a clever one at 
; that -- one that works like sending a letter via normal mail 
; with no postage and writing the name of the address you want it 
; delivered to in the 'from' space.  Then when the post office 
; 'returns' the letter for lack of postage, they are actually 
; delivering it.
; 
; I also feel a bit cruel about failing to reply to Baerbel's 
; request for information about unsubscribing from the Fractint 
; list.  But it's a bit amusing to see such a request (from 
; someone who already knew how to subscribe) appear three lines 
; below the unsubscribe information in the letter's header.
; 
; As for today's fractal, (which I have rated at a harmless 6), 
; it's a scene in the fractal that results when 0.01 part of Z^2 
; is added to Z^(-2), and (1/C) is added to the combination, then 
; the whole thing is iterated with a bailout radius of 100.  That 
; 0.01 part of Z^2 is not much, but it makes a world of difference 
; in the final fractal.
; 
; The parent fractal, which is enclosed in a circle, looks 
; surprisingly like a fractal planet.  Changing the logmap of 
; today's image to 0 and doing about 10 out-zooms will reveal this 
; planet in its full glory.  As is the case with most fractals 
; that contain a negative exponent of Z, the bailout radius has a 
; great effect on the appearance of the fractal.  With the parent 
; fractal on the screen, redraw the image with imag(p3) set to 
; 2400.  A totally different image appears.
; 
; I named today's image "Iterative Teardrops" because of the 
; teardrop shape of the elements surrounding the central midget.  
; These disconnected elements are typical of fractals whose 
; formula contains negative powers of Z.  The rating of 6 equals a 
; little above normal on my rating scale -- about the mildest 
; praise I could give to such a mundane image.
; 
; The redeeming feature is the render time of 6 minutes, and the 
; fact that the completed GIF image file may be downloaded from 
; either of the following web addresses:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Saturday here at Fractal Central was 
; uneventful.  The partly cloudy day with a temperature of 95F 35C 
; and moderately high humidity was notable only because it 
; continues the warmer and drier than normal pattern that has 
; prevailed most all summer.  Also it was the fourth day in a row 
; on which the weather experts had predicted showers, and the 
; fourth day in a row on which the predicted showers failed to 
; arrive.  Those experts are far better at explaining why 
; something did not happen than forecasting what will happen.  The 
; fractal cats, who are unconcerned with weather experts, passed 
; the day doing what cats do best -- lazing around the fractal 
; grounds.
; 
; As for me, it's Sunday morning, and if I really work hard, I 
; might find a way to get through the day without working.  And 
; don't laugh.  After all, working to avoid work is no more anti-
; productive than fighting for peace.  Until next time, on the 
; 20th, take care, and don't be too lazy.
