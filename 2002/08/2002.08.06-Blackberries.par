; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Fractal Central has suffered two more power failures since I 
; posted my most recent letter.  (But still the fractals keep 
; coming.)  This most recent outage was the tenth since Saturday 
; morning.  I know this to be an accurate count because every time 
; the power cuts off and comes back on, my fax machine spits out a 
; 5cm strip of paper.  There are 10 strips now lying beside the 
; fax machine.
; 
; The local electric utility, always with a handy excuse, claims 
; that broken trees are continuing to fall.  This is well and 
; good, except that they also advertise their professional tree-
; trimming program which they claim is designed to prevent such 
; outages.
; 
; The newer suburban subdivisions in the area are being 
; constructed with the power lines underground, which does cut 
; back on the number of outages, but this creates another problem. 
; Fractal Central lies in a lightning-prone area, and the above-
; ground power grid acts as a rather effective, if unintentional, 
; lightning rod.  After almost every lightning storm, there is 
; news of one or more of these new high-priced houses in one of 
; these new subdivisions without overhead power lines being struck 
; by lightning and set afire.  I guess I'd rather have a few power 
; outages per year than have my house burn down.  And finally, 
; what ever happened to those old-fashioned but effective 
; lightning rods on the rooftops?
; 
; As for today's fractal, I entered a lot of ones into the M-Mix4 
; formula and came up with a basket of blackberries.  The fractal 
; berries actually have me hungry.  Not surprisingly, I named the 
; image "Blackberries".  It's an acceptable image, maybe a little 
; above average.  As such, it was rated a liberal 6.
; 
; Spending 39 minutes to render a single 6-rated fractal is a bit 
; much to expect of even the most avid fractalist.  For increased 
; happiness, I suggest a download of the completed GIF image file 
; from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Monday here at Fractal Central was hot and 
; humid, with a temperature of 95F 35C, which was just hot enough 
; to keep the dynamic duo confined to quarters.  In the evening a 
; light shower passed over, followed by a cooling breeze to make 
; the evening end pleasantly.
; 
; Today promises to continue the cooling trend, but before I can 
; enjoy the pleasant conditions, I must finish some work, while 
; hoping the power stays on.  And before I finish, I must begin.  
; So until next time, (on the 8th), take care, and strive for 
; perfection.
