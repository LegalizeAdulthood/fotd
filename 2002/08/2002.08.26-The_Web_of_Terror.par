; ---------
; FOTD -- August 26, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The midget at the center of today's image is located on the 
; X-axis of its parent fractal, which has X-axis symmetry.  This 
; is demonstrated not only by the coordinates in the parameter 
; file but by the straightness of the arms radiating from the 
; midget.  The 180 degree rotation of the image does not change 
; the east-west orientation of the X-axis, so why do 2 out-zooms 
; reveal a north-south oriented axis?  The mystery is not very 
; deep, a few more out-zooms reveal the true situation -- the 
; X-axis is not continuous.
; 
; Actually, only one out-zoom reveals an interesting scene -- a 
; near-perfect array of square figures that almost made it as 
; FOTD.  The choice between the squares in the out-zoom and the 
; octagons in today's image was a toss-up.  The squares lost only 
; because one of the two images had to lose.
; 
; The generating formula subtracts 0.2 part of Z^(-3) from Z^(-2) 
; before adding 1/C.  If I had added the 0.2 part of Z^(-3) rather 
; than subtract it, the resulting parent fractal would still have 
; had X-axis symmetry, but its overall shape would have been 
; totally different, and of course, today's image would not have 
; existed.  (More accurately, it still would have existed but it 
; would never have been found.)
; 
; I used the MandelbrotMix2 formula to find today's image.  This 
; formula works the same as the overworked MandelbrotMix4 formula, 
; except that it includes the capability to change the starting 
; point of Z.  This capability is not used in today's image.
; 
; The name of the image, "The Web of Terror", which sounds like 
; the title of a horror movie, has no connection whatever to the 
; appearance.  I might have had a fleeting impression of a 
; spider's web, but if so, I can no longer see the resemblance.  
; The rating of 7 seems fairly accurate, and those who spend the 
; 3 minutes to run the parameter file will not be disappointed.  
; Those who download the completed GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; will not be disappointed either.
; 
; The Sunday weather here at Fractal Central was perfect for most 
; anything, with blue skies, puffy white clouds, gentle breezes, 
; low humidity, and a temperature of 86F 30C.  The fractal duo 
; were happy all day, which is a rare event for them.
; 
; My happiness however depends on finishing the work I now find 
; before me.  If I start now, I can be finished by 3pm.  If I wait 
; an hour, I will not finish before 4pm.  If I put off some of the 
; work until tomorrow, I can be finished by noon.  Most likely, 
; I'll choose the first option.  Until next FOTD, which will 
; arrive in all its glory within 48 hours, take care, and beware 
; of fractals lurking in dark corners.
