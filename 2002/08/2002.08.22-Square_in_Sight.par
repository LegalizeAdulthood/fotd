; ---------
; FOTD -- August 22, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Checking the fractal gossip lines, I see that a new version of 
; the fractal generating program preferred by the trendy fractal 
; crowd has just been released.  I already have the previous 
; version of the program, though I rarely use it, so I may or may 
; not eventually pick up this newest version, for which the 
; program's author is charging a nominal upgrade fee.  In any 
; case, I'll wait until a debugged version appears.
; 
; I have nothing against the performance of this other program, 
; it's a fine fractal generator, but I remember several years ago, 
; when the Fractint list was receiving queries from the author of 
; the other program, asking questions about the operation of the 
; Fractint code.  Shortly thereafter, the other program appeared 
; on the scene as a shareware product, and the 'I'm an artist' 
; crowd left the Fractint list to flock to the other program.
; 
; So far, so good, but I wonder how much of the original Fractint 
; code now resides in slightly modified form in the other program, 
; which is being sold for profit.  Something not quite ethical 
; appears to have happened somewhere along the line, but neither I 
; nor apparently anyone else can pin it down.
; 
; Well, I guess it's time to move on from ethics to today's 
; fractal, which was generated by the old-fashioned Fractint 
; program aided by the MandelbrotMix4 formula.  The expression 
; 6Z^(-0.7)-0.12Z^(2.2)+(1/C) was iterated to create the parent 
; fractal, which consists of a large double-lobed Mandeloid with a 
; smaller satellite Mandeloid just to the east.  Today's midget 
; lies deep in the main valley on the east side of the large 
; Mandeloid.
; 
; I named today's image "Square in Sight".  No square features 
; actually exist in the image, but the coloring gives the 
; appearance that the midget lies in the center of a square.  This 
; illusory square inspired the name.
; 
; I feel that the rating of 7 is justified in light of the fact 
; that the pattern around the midget is different enough to 
; warrant notice.  The render time in the 4-minute range is short 
; enough to make running the parameter file practical and long 
; enough to make it interesting.
; 
; As always, those who would rather avoid parameter files may 
; download the completed image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather was typical mid-summer fare here at Fractal 
; Central on Wednesday.  The high temperature of 88F 31C was just 
; about average; the moderately high humidity and stagnant air 
; were also average for mid-summer.  The fractal cat duo had an 
; average day -- one hour outdoors lounging in the shade, 22-3/4 
; hours indoors lounging on the floor, 1/4 hour eating.
; 
; With another day's work before me, I'd best get busy without 
; delay.  Until the next glorious FOTD appears on August 24, take 
; care, and remain steadfast.
