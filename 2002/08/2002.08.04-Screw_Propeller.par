; ---------
; FOTD -- August 04, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After a day without power and a live wire sparking and 
; sputtering on the ground in the alley beside Fractal central, 
; the local electric utility has finally repaired the situation, 
; and things are back to normal.
; 
; (I wrote the above paragraph around 11am this morning, when I 
; assumed things were under control.  Unfortunately, the power 
; went off again before I could post the FOTD, and just now, 
; 10:15pm, has come back on for good . . . I hope.)  
; 
; With no time to search for an outstanding fractal, I had to 
; settle on a run-of-the-mill high-iteration midget located in a 
; remote valley of the Mandelbrot set.  I named the image "Screw 
; Propeller".  I gave it this name because the elements around the 
; midget remind me of a ship's propeller, and not as an insult to 
; some imaginary fellow named 'propeller'.
; 
; Since the scene is in the classic M-set, and the midget happens 
; to be the first one I came to, I have rated the picture a 
; perfectly average 5.  The only really unusual feature of the 
; image is the high maxiter of 100,000 and the logmap setting of 
; over 13,000.
; 
; Since its magnitude is still within the range of conventional 
; math, the image renders in 10 minutes.  The image will download 
; from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; in even less time however.
; 
; The fractal weather Saturday started with a violent thunder-
; storm with 80mph (130kph) winds, over 4 inches (10cm) of rain in 
; one hour, hail and continuous lightning.  Trees fell everywhere. 
; The day then continued with heat, humidity and additional but 
; less violent storms.  The 95F 35C heat and thunder kept the 
; fractal duo of cats confined to the indoors.  The power failure 
; that ensued when a tree across the alley fell on power lines 
; kept me from fractalling and left me with no excuse to escape 
; the task of cutting and collecting the fallen tree limbs that 
; cluttered the front lawn.
; 
; Today is just as hot, but at least no more storms are in sight.  
; Until the next time on August 06, take care, and fractals may be 
; the answer, but first one must know the question.
