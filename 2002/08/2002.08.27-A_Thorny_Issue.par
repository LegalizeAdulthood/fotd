; ---------
; FOTD -- August 28, 2002 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is closely related to the 
; parent of the image of Aug 26th.  Negative portions of Z^(-2) 
; and Z^(-3) are combined before (1/C) is added.  The resulting 
; fractal consists of a large central bay with a non-critical 
; cloverleaf-like island at the center.  This cloverleaf holds 
; little of interest, but the western shore of the bay features a 
; very prominent sub-bay, with critical buds and filaments.
; 
; The filaments are not the simple jagged lines of the M-set 
; filaments, but are twisted into loops and rings that hold 
; countless midgets.  Today's midget lies in a branch of a tiny 
; ring near the tip of a filament.
; 
; Actually, the midget is not there at all, for the escape radius 
; of a full googol has totally evaporated the outside material, 
; leaving only a blank inside of trapped points.  But all is not 
; lost.  The inside fill of bof61 has revealed the ghost of the 
; midget that once was there but now has gone.
; 
; Curiously, the bof61 inside fill is the only fill that produces 
; such a fine image.  I think the bof61 fill colors the inside 
; points according to which iteration comes closest to the origin, 
; but I'm not sure.  Regardless, the image rates an exceptional 8, 
; which is the highest rating in several months.
; 
; The name I gave to the image, "A Thorny Issue", is totally 
; whimsical.  The phrase simply came into my head as I studied the 
; scene.  (I'll bet a psych-something or other could learn a lot 
; about my secret unconscious life from the titles I sometimes 
; half-consciously give to my FOTD's.)
; 
; The 3-minute render time of the parameter file is fair enough.  
; A download of the finished image is even fairer.  The completed 
; image may be found on Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and on Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather here at Fractal Central on Tuesday featured 
; morning sunshine followed by increasingly thick afternoon clouds 
; and a high temperature of 86F 30C.  The duo of fractal cats must 
; have approved, for they spent several hours prowling in the 
; holly thicket at the bottom of the back yard, cleverly avoiding 
; the burdock burrs and thistles that, despite all attempts at 
; eradication, still grow there.
; 
; And if I'm to avoid a late start in the morning, I must soon 
; shut down the fractal shoppe and call it a night.  Until the 
; next mind-boggling FOTD appears on Friday the 30th, take care, 
; and be as happy as the fractal duo.
