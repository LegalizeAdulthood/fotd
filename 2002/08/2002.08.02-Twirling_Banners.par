; FOTD -- August 02, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; At first glance, today's image looks like an exotic midget 
; created by the MandelbrotMix4 formula, but it is not.  The 
; image, with it's almost-disconnected appearance, is actually a 
; scene in our faithful old friend, the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The scene is located deep on a filament in the northeast suburbs 
; of the large midget on the negative stem of the M-set.  The 
; exact location can be found in a few seconds by outzooming.  As 
; one backs out, the magnitude soon falls within the range of 
; conventional math, so the trip back to the surface is a fast one.
; 
; Today's scene almost appears disconnected, but it is not.  All 
; parts of the Mandelbrot set, including the midgets and the 
; elements around them, are connected to the main body of the set. 
; The shoreline of every midget and the main body as well is a 
; single unit.  True, the connection is often made by an 
; infinitesimally thin filament, but the connection is there.  
; 
; By comparison, many fractals created by the MandelbrotMix4 
; formula are not connected.  In these fractals, there frequently 
; is no main body, but only a cloud of fractal debris scattered 
; around the area like ejecta around an explosion.  And like at 
; the scene of an explosion, isolated bits of debris are often 
; found far from the center, totally disconnected from the rest of 
; the fractal.
; 
; I named today's definitely connected fractal "Twirling Banners" 
; when I was reminded of synchronized gymnasts twirling their 
; banners.  If it were not part of the M-set, today's image might 
; have rated a 7.  As it is, a rating of a slightly-above-average 
; 6 will have to suffice.
; 
; Since the image is in the magnitude range where arbitrary 
; precision math is required, it takes over 22 minutes to render 
; on my P200 machine.  A download of the completed GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; will be considerably faster.
; 
; The weather Thursday here at Fractal Central was of the typical 
; high-summer variety -- a temperature of 97F 36C, blazing sun, 
; high humidity, and light winds.  In the evening, thunder clouds 
; developed on the horizon, but never moved in.  These conditions 
; kept the fractal cats confined to the cool indoors through the 
; afternoon.  In the evening, when the sun sank low and they 
; finally did venture outdoors, the local catbird began annoying 
; them, apparently aware that their bird-catching days are nearly 
; finished.
; 
; And now it's Friday morning -- another hot day -- and I've got a 
; pile of work to finish.  It's time to reconfigure the fractal 
; shoppe into a workroom and get busy.  Until next FOTD on the 4th 
; of August, take care, and fractals are too complex to be 
; natural, yet they are not artifacts.  So what are they?
