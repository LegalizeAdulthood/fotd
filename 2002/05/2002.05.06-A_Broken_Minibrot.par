; FOTD -- May 06, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image was created by the iterated 
; formula Z^(1.8)+C, and is shaped like a rotated and perturbed 
; version of the classic M-set.  The image is located in a broken 
; elephant trunk of the fractured East Valley area of the parent.
; 
; I named the image "A Broken Minibrot" because of the spirals 
; which are so obviously broken.  The image is of average quality 
; and rates an average rating of 5.  The breaks in image 
; continuity are unavoidable with fractional exponents of Z, and 
; are caused by the multi-valued nature of the complex log 
; function.  But the same multi-valued nature is not all bad, 
; since it makes the resulting fractals infinite both on the 
; surface as well as in their depth.
; 
; The 14-minute render time can be reduced to a minute or two by 
; going online and downloading the finished image from Paul's web 
; site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Though I took the day off on Sunday, the FOTD CD is progressing. 
; A midsummer completion still looks likely, and anything worth 
; having is worth waiting for.
; 
; The all-important fractal weather Sunday here at Fractal Central 
; was just what the fractal cats ordered.  Well, maybe they didn't 
; order it, but they certainly did enjoy it.  Warm sun, light 
; winds and a temperature of 68F 20C made conditions ideal for man 
; and cat alike.  Both the dynamic duo and myself spent a good 
; part of the afternoon in the yard, the only diversion being when 
; Tippy started rolling in the emerging catnip patch.
; 
; Since all good things must eventually end, this day is just 
; about on its last lap.  It's near late-news time and I can't end 
; the day without knowing the latest bit of bad news.  So until 
; next time on May 9, take care, and let's get some fractal into 
; that fractal philosophy.
