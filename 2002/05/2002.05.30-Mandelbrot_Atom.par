; FOTD -- May 30, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's 6-rated fractal, (I couldn't rate it any higher), is a 
; scene in the classic Mandelbrot set, created with the classic 
; Mandel formula.  The midget at the center of the image is a 
; third-order one located on a minor filament of a larger midget, 
; which in turn is located on a filament extending from the 
; second bud of the largest midget of all -- the one at -1.75 of 
; the M-set.
; 
; To find today's scene, I chose an area where the filaments are 
; ready to collapse from broad areas of chaos to strings of zero 
; width.  Like everything else in the M-set, the exact point where 
; this happens is elusive and always a few in-zooms beyond the 
; image on the screen, but today's fractal gives a fairly good 
; idea of the nature of the area where the collapse happens.
; 
; I named the picture "Mandelbrot Atom".  Midgets are sometimes 
; referred to as 'atoms' and a name such as "Mandelbrot Midget" 
; would have been a bit too trite a name for a FOTD.  ;-)
; 
; On my aging machine, the parameter file, which requires 
; arbitrary precision math, takes one hour to complete.  Those 
; with time or a computer to spare will enjoy watching the scene 
; slowly appear on the screen.  Most of us will give Paul and 
; Scott a chance to render and post the image, then download the 
; completed image from their web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather here at Fractal Central was near perfect Wednesday.  
; Only a bit too much humidity kept it from being absolutely 
; perfect.  The brilliant sun and temperature of 82F 28C was ideal 
; for any activity including sleeping, which the fractal cats did 
; most of the day and which is not exactly an activity.  But they 
; did it anyway, and they did it well.
; 
; As for me, I find myself faced with work, which is the normal 
; situation but which still needs to be done.  So until next FOTD 
; on June 3, (the 4-day break is a one-time thing), take care, and 
; the time is growing near.
