; FOTD -- May 03, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal scene exists in an oversized parent fractal, way 
; out on a filament that leads from a mandel-bud of the main bay 
; and terminates in a ring-like feature.  Many filaments converge 
; on this ring, but only the one that comes from the bud has 
; midgets along it.
; 
; The terminal ring is mirrored in the eight rings, (I call them 
; keyholes), that surround the midget in today's image.  The 
; formula of the parent fractal is Z^(-11)+6Z^(-1.1)+(1/C).  This 
; formula was iterated by the MandelbrotMix2 Fractint formula, 
; which likely will replace the old M-Mix4 formula as my most 
; often used formula.  The speed of the new formula is the same, 
; and the new one is more versatile.
; 
; The blue-gold color scheme makes the image appear a bit better 
; than its actual worth of average.  I therefore rated it at a 6, 
; which is the least possible above-average rating for a FOTD 
; fractal.
; 
; The 9-minute render time of the attached parameter file makes a 
; download of the completed GIF image the marginally better 
; choice.  That download can be found at Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Thursday started with a heavy thunder-storm, 
; followed by sun from 10am to 3pm.  At 4pm, another heavy thunder-
; storm, this one with golf-ball-sized hail, passed over.  Between 
; storms it was warm and humid, with a temperature around 80F 27C. 
; The fractal cats found enough time during the midday sunny 
; period to romp in the yard, but when the hailstones started 
; clattering, they dashed for cover and didn't come out for nearly 
; an hour.
; 
; As for myself, I've got work waiting and not enough time in 
; which to do it.  The best way I know of solving the problem is 
; to get started, so that's what I'm about to do.  And that FOTD 
; CD, which has been languishing of late, still has a considerable 
; amount of work to be done.  The next FOTD will appear May 6.  
; Until then, take care, and be philosophical.
