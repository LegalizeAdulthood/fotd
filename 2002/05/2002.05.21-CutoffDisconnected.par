; FOTD -- May 21, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Do not give up hope.  The FOTD CD is past the halfway point, and 
; sometime this summer the 1,700 or so fractal images and 
; discussions will be available for distribution.  Even better 
; news is that, when the CD is completed, the ongoing FOTD will 
; return to the daily schedule, while hopefully increasing in 
; quality.
; 
; The midget at the center of today's image, which exists in the 
; fractal created by the formula (Z^3)+0.4(Z^5)+C, is located in 
; the suburbs of a larger midget in a cut-off feature deep in an 
; un-named valley of its bloated parent fractal.  Since the 
; feature in which today's midget lies is cut off from the main 
; body of the fractal, the midget itself is cut off from its 
; surroundings.
; 
; I needed to include the <mathtolerance=/1> entry in the 
; parameter file because of the magnitude of the image, which, at 
; close to 9*10^12, is in the borderline range where strange 
; things begin to happen.
; 
; In fact, strange things are already happening.  The pattern 
; surrounding the midget is infinitely disconnected.  Regardless 
; of how close to the actual shore-line of the midget a particular 
; feature lies, that feature will be disconnected from the main 
; body of the midget.  The situation is somewhat similar to that 
; of the Newton's images, where the areas leading to different 
; roots lie adjacent to each other with no space between them, yet 
; at no point do they actually touch.  The boundaries between the 
; basins are fractal in nature.
; 
; I have named today's image "Cutoff Disconnected", a redundant 
; name that emphasizes the nature of the midget at the center.  I 
; rated it a 6, a rating I have been using quite a lot since 
; cutting the frequency of the FOTD's by 2/3.  The image is nice, 
; it is interesting, it is curious, but such words really mean 
; nothing.  IMO, today's image is worth no more than the present 
; rating.
; 
; With a render time in the vicinity of 20 minutes, the parameter 
; file of today's image is a bit of a drag to run.  Wise 
; fractalists, (that is everyone), will let Paul and Scott do the 
; rendering, and download the completed GIF image from one of 
; their web sites.
; 
; Paul's site is at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Scott's is at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Monday here at Fractal Central was mostly 
; sunny, but with occasional cloudy periods.  The chilly 
; temperature of 59F 15C combined with the breaks in the periods 
; of sun kept the dynamic duo of fractal cats dashing in and out 
; all afternoon.
; 
; As for myself, I've got to dash off to finish some important 
; work so that I can get back to the fun work on that FOTD CD, 
; which despite fears is progressing just a bit behind schedule.  
; I shall return on the 24th with another fractal to amaze and 
; delight even the mathematically challenged.
