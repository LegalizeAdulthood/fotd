; FOTD -- May 27, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; We're at the end of a crackling lightning storm this Monday 
; morning here at Fractal Central.  The rain has stopped falling 
; but the cats are still hiding.  Luckily, all the utilities, 
; especially the e-mail, are still functional.
; 
; I know that the e-mail is working because I have just received 
; a letter from Bruce Ikenaga, originator? of the mysterious but 
; famous, (for devoted Fractint users), Ikenaga function.  I have 
; not yet read the rather lengthy letter, but at first glance it 
; appears to explain the mystery surrounding the 'function', 
; which, as I recall, Mr. Ikenaga once denied writing.  When I 
; have read the letter and determined that it contains nothing 
; which Mr. Ikenaga would prefer to be kept private, I will 
; forward it to the list.
; 
; Today's image was created by a formula that mixes various 
; portions of four different negative powers of Z: -1.2, -2, -2.8, 
; and -6, and adds 1/C.  The parent fractal created by this 
; mixture is shaped like a crescent moon, with today's midget 
; located on the north shore of the largest bud.
; 
; I named today's image "Sausages".  It's not a very classy name, 
; but a string of sausages is the first thing that came to mind as 
; I studied the image.  I rated the image at a 6, the rating I 
; usually apply when I can't decide.
; 
; With the parameter file's render time of 13 minutes, running it 
; is not the most efficient way to see the sausages.  A far more 
; efficient method is to download the completed image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Sunday here at the Fractal Central was warm 
; and humid, with a high temperature of 79F 26C and humidity to 
; match.  Thunder-storms threatened in the evening but never 
; materialized.  The cats spent a lazy day lounging on the porch 
; in the hazy sun, sniffing at the aroma of the neighborhood cook-
; outs, which occasionally wafted by.  When a careless sparrow 
; landed on the porch railing, Tippy made a move to stalk it, but 
; decided the result would not be worth the effort, and returned 
; to sleep.
; 
; The yard work that lies before me, however, most definitely will 
; be worth the effort -- if I get it finished that is.  And the 
; way to finish a job is to start at the beginning, so I'd best 
; get moving.  My only escape would be for the rain to continue 
; all day, but that does not appear likely.  Until the 30th, take 
; care, and place your faith in fractals.
