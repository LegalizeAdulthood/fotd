; FOTD -- May 18, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The FOTD CD progresses, the rain falls, it's Preakness festival 
; Saturday here in Fractal Land, and all else is well.
; (A Preakness is a horse race that tries to be another Kentucky 
; Derby!)
; 
; But the FOTD is about fractals, not horses.
; 
; Today's image is a flowery affair which I found in the fractal 
; that results when the formula Z^(-6)+6Z^(-1.6)+(1/C) is iterated.
; 
; This parent fractal is an indescribable affair, with bays of all 
; shapes and sizes, and lots of places that might harbor 
; interesting scenes.  (I leave it to the math experts to figure 
; what all those bays represent.)  Today's minibrot is located 
; near the southern edge of the largest bay, actually in an area 
; that at first glance appears to hold little promise.
; 
; The area appears so hopeless in fact that I almost passed it by. 
; Only an area of vague symmetry drew me to investigate further.  
; And when I did investigate, I was glad that I had not passed by.
; 
; I named the picture "The Blue Light".  There is no obvious 
; reason why I chose this name; I simply like its sound.  I rated 
; the image at a 6 because there is really nothing exceptional 
; about it.
; 
; Perhaps the best feature of today's image is its speed, 
; rendering from the parameter file as it does in well under one 
; minute.  As always, those who would rather download than render 
; may pick up the pre-rendered GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Friday here at Fractal Central was near 
; perfect, especially for the cats who wanted to be comfortable 
; outdoors.  Generous sun and a temperature of 81F 27C kept them 
; happy in the yard all afternoon.  Thinking he was once again a 
; kitten, Tippy scampered up a holly tree, but the bird he was 
; chasing flew away long before he reached the branch where the 
; bird had perched.  A heavy rain shower passed over in the 
; evening, but by that time the dynamic duo had settled for the 
; night in their favorite indoor spots.
; 
; This morning the rain is continuing, and there's much work to do 
; and only limited time in which to do it.  So until Tuesday the 
; 21st of May, take care, and search for truth.
