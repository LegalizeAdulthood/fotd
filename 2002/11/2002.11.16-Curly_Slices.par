; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the fractal that results when 8 
; parts of Z^(-11) are added to 12 negative parts of Z^(-1.1) 
; before adding 1/C.  Normally, this parent fractal would be an 
; island surrounded by an infinite ocean, but by adding 1/C 
; instead of C the entire fractal has been turned inside out, or 
; inverted, and instead of appearing as an island, the fractal 
; resembles a marshy area with X-axis symmetry, which is filled 
; with debris-choked ponds.
; 
; Perhaps the most prominent feature of this parent fractal is the 
; large fan-shaped feature just east of the origin.  Similar fan-
; shaped features often appear in inverted fractals created with 
; negative powers of Z.  At first glance, these fractal fans 
; appear to be totally non-critical and therefore devoid of 
; midgets, but a careful search sometimes proves otherwise.
; 
; Today's image lies in the outskirts of a larger midget in a 
; cut-off feature in the northern part of its parent's fan.  I 
; gave it the name "Curly Slices" when I noticed the resemblance 
; of the four prominent features surrounding the midget to slices 
; of bread with curly extensions attached to their top corners.  
; Maybe it is just my less-than-cheery mood, but I could find 
; nothing in the image that would rate higher than the slightly-
; below-average rating of 4 that I gave it.
; 
; The 13-minute render time can be avoided by downloading the 
; completed GIF image from one of the FOTD web sites, which may be 
; found at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The Friday weather here at Fractal Central was very pleasant, 
; and the cats were very happy.  Warm sun, light breezes, and a 
; temperature of 63F 17C gave them a comfortable afternoon in the 
; yard.
; 
; But this morning is cold and rainy, and it will likely stay this 
; way all day, and the dynamic, sun-loving cats will likely be far 
; less satisfied.  For me it will be a day to finish a small 
; amount of work and watch the rain.  When I tire of watching the 
; rain, I will turn to the world of fractals.  The best fractal I 
; find will appear as tomorrow's FOTD.  Until then, take care, and 
; turn to fractals when reason fails.
