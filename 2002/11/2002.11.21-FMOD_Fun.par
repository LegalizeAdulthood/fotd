; ---------
; FOTD -- November 21, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; An earlier start today will hopefully avoid yesterday's log jam 
; here at F.C.
; 
; For today's image we return to the claw of yesterday's FOTD and 
; concentrate on the area near the origin.  When entered into the 
; M-Mix4 formula, the claw parameters draw a default screen with 
; an obvious though somewhat-distorted Mandeloid just north of 
; center and a nascent Mandeloid tucked in on the lower left 
; border.  Today's scene lies in a small area of irregularity on 
; the east shoreline of the main bay of this half-developed 
; Mandeloid.
; 
; When rendered in the outside=iter mode, today's scene has little 
; to recommend it, and rates no more than a 3, but with the 
; outside set to fmod and the proximity set to 1, an entirely new 
; image appears, and the rating jumps to a 6.  The image is also 
; helped by the bit of extra effort that went into the coloring.  
; Smooth gradients do not come easily with only 256 colors to work 
; with.
; 
; A couple weeks ago, there was an FOTD image named "FMOD 
; Fantasy".  Today's image is named simply "FMOD Fun".  It's an 
; apt name.  Fractals, after all, are fun.  They're fun to sit and 
; admire, and even more fun to work with.
; 
; Today's image is all the more fun because of its relatively 
; short render time.  Less than 3 minutes are required for the 
; magic to work that turns the attached parameter file into a 
; finished image.  Those who don't believe in magic can see the 
; image by downloading it from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; And if fractals are not magic, I would like to know what is.
; 
; With lots of sun, light breezes, and a temperature of 59F 15C, 
; the weather was ideal for cats and man here at Fractal Central 
; on Wednesday.  Needless to say, the cats were happy.  The man 
; was busy.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy, with rain on the way.  The cats will 
; not be happy about this.  The man will finish his work earlier 
; and relax.  Until next time, which will arrive in 24 hours, 
; take care, and don't be hamstrung by the need to be scientifi-
; cally correct.
