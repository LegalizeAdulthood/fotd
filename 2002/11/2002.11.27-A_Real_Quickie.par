; FOTD -- November 27, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal image might be the quickest of all time, not in 
; terms of render time, though this is under 3 minutes, but in 
; terms of the time I spent in finding the scene with its midget 
; at the center.  Running on fractal instinct alone, and using 
; Fractint's evolver feature for the real(p1) and real(p2) 
; parameters, I found a parent fractal that appeared as though it 
; might be promising.
; 
; With nothing to guide me but instinct, I chose an apparently 
; non-critical area of chaos in the eastern suburbs of the parent, 
; and, simply to see what might lie there, zoomed in at random.  
; Though no signs of the two-way symmetry that indicates the basin 
; of a midget appeared, I kept zooming.  I cannot say what drove 
; me onward, but I kept going.  The new images came up very fast.  
; Then, after only a minute and much to my surprise, there it was 
; before me -- the unmistakable signs of a midget.  Once I had 
; found the rather unique midget, a few minutes of color cycling 
; produced today's FOTD.
; 
; I have no idea how I stumbled upon the midget.  A quick trip 
; back to the surface of the parent will show how unlikely its 
; existence seems from up there.  Intact midgets do not appear in 
; non-critical fractals or non-critical-appearing fractal regions. 
; I guess I was just lucky.
; 
; The name, "A Real Quickie" refers to the time I spent in finding 
; the midget, not the 2-3/4 minutes required to render the image.  
; The rating of 6 is limited by the small effort that went into 
; the coloring.  With so much work before me, I had no time to put 
; more effort into the coloring phase.
; 
; For the convenience of those who would rather nor run parameter 
; files, the completed GIF image is available on the W.W.W. at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Tuesday was a cloudy, chilly day here in Fractal Land, with a 
; temperature that never topped 45F 7C.  The fractal cats 
; responded by being irritable when they found the outdoors not to 
; their liking.  But when they saw those chunks of tuna appear in 
; their food dishes, their moods improved notably.
; 
; My mood will improve notably when I take the work now before me 
; and put it behind me.  But that will take some effort, and 
; unless I start I'll never finish.  Until tomorrow's FOTD, take 
; care, and anything worth having is worth waiting for -- but not 
; waiting too long.
