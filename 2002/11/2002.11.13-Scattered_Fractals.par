; FOTD -- November 13, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With its dull, earthy brown shapes floating before a glowing, 
; celestial blue background, today's fractal has a pronounced 3-D 
; effect.  It could be a glimpse of heaven as seen from one of the 
; lower regions, presuming that heaven has blue skies, that is.  
; But it is not.  It is a fractal created by combining portions of 
; Z^(-1.77) and Z^(-8.8).
; 
; The ridiculous escape radius of 10^100 signals that the image is 
; an evaporated one consisting entirely of trapped inside points.  
; The picture consists of spirits of dead outside material made 
; visible by a non-flat inside fill, in this case the < bof61 > 
; fill.  I believe this fill colors the inside points according to 
; which iteration comes closest to the origin.
; 
; I have named the image "Scattered Fractals".  I gave it this 
; name when I heard the phrase 'scattered showers' on the weather 
; report on the F.C. radio.  It is a true name because, as is the 
; case with most all images, an infinity of smaller fractals is 
; scattered throughout the scene.
; 
; The rating of 6 might be a bit optimistic for an image with so 
; many dark somber colors in the foreground, but the blue in the 
; background speaks of better things beyond, and justifies the 
; slightly above average rating.
; 
; The render time of 6 minutes is a bit slow, but regardless of 
; the render time, the completed GIF image can be downloaded in a 
; minute or so from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; With the temperature at 50F 10C, the rain fell all day Tuesday 
; here at Fractal Central, and the cats complained all afternoon, 
; running from one door to another, searching futilely for the 
; door that led to a sunny warm day.  They never found the sun, 
; and had to settle for treats of tuna and turkey.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy and brisk.  I've got cats to keep happy 
; and work to finish.  Until next time, take care, and enjoy your 
; fractals while you have them.
