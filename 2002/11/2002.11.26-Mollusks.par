; FOTD -- November 26, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Now that I have found a way to eliminate the nuisance of un-
; wanted e-mail, I sometimes amuse myself by actually reading the 
; pathetic junk.  This morning for example, I found 23 unwanted 
; letters in my e-mailbox.  Of these 23, three would make me into 
; a 'bigger' man, two had approved my non-existent mortgage appli-
; cation, and the remaining 18 offered a way I could earn a lot of 
; money by doing next to nothing.
; 
; Unfortunately, all of the money-making letters required me to 
; spend money before I could find how to get rich by doing almost 
; nothing.  Another problem was that most of the letters failed to 
; disclose the nature of the get-rich-quick business they were 
; promoting.  I lost track of how many times I read phrases such 
; as 'unlimited demand' and 'this business'.  By the time I had 
; finished reading the junk, I was convinced that I could probably 
; do better raising chinchillas or selling sensuous pizzas.  
; Fractals will never make me rich, but at least, they are honest.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image combines portions of 
; Z^(-1.313) and Z^(-13.13).  Then, to turn the fractal rightside-
; out, 1/C has been added instead of the normal C.  The result is 
; a large Mandeloid with a scattering of smaller Mandeloids 
; arranged in a broad ring extending to the east and south.  One 
; of these smaller Mandeloids appears to consist of two Mandelbrot 
; sets partly merged.  Today's image is located in a broad valley 
; where the two sets come together.
; 
; I studied today's image for several minutes before finding the 
; name "Mollusks".  I can give no logical reason for the name 
; other than I felt like using it.  And the eight dark red 
; features surrounding the midget actually do vaguely resemble 
; steamed lobster claws.  (Is a lobster a mollusk?)
; 
; I rated the image at a 6, which is a bit above average on my 
; scale of fractal worth.  It might have rated a 7, were it not 
; for the 37-minute render time.  But as always, the completed GIF 
; image is available on the internet at the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The Monday weather here at Fractal Central was of the pleasant 
; variety.  Warm sun, light winds, and a temperature of 61F 16C 
; kept the cats active and happy in the yard most of the 
; afternoon.  Tippy briefly eyed a nut-gathering squirrel, but 
; decided to do nothing but watch.  Thomas just watched Tippy.
; 
; This morning is cloudy and colder, with a raw north wind.  The 
; duo will be much less happy, and a treat will likely be 
; necessary.  For me it promises to be a routine day -- do the 
; work, then explore the fractal world.  The next FOTD will appear 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and have a fractalish day.
