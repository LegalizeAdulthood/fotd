; FOTD -- November 05, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; True, it's a few days past Halloween, but today's image has 
; something creepy about it.  With its somber dark blue color 
; palette and its eight objects that could be taken as leeches, it 
; might serve as an adequate cover for a paperback horror novel 
; with a title such as "The Leeches that Sucked the World Dry".  
; (Yes, I could be thinking of certain local politicians running 
; for office.  It's election day here in Fractal Central country.) 
; Not wanting to name the image after something as unappealing as 
; a dish of leeches, I gave it the more childish name "Creepy-
; Crawlies".
; 
; The parent fractal is a grossly bloated Mandeloid rotated 180 
; degrees and on the verge of turning inside-out.  The main 
; period-2 bud, which is on the east side of the large bay has 
; been totally obliterated by the ballooning bay itself.  The bay 
; has expanded so far that instead of the period-2 bud being the 
; most prominent, buds with a periodicity around 30 or 40 are most 
; prominent.  Today's scene lies in the northern chaos that has 
; accumulated as the whole fractal has expanded.
; 
; I am sometimes asked how I find these midgets in unfamiliar 
; areas of unfamiliar fractals.  I'm not entirely sure how I do 
; it.  My attention is often attracted by elements that appear to 
; have two-way symmetry.  Then I simply get a feeling that a 
; midget lies deep down at that spot, and when I go look, I am 
; right as often as wrong.  The route I took to today's midget can 
; be retraced in reverse by turning off the logmap and outzooming. 
; The trip back out will go faster if the passes is reset to <g> 
; and thumbnail-sized images are calculated.
; 
; Today's image, which was calculated in the basic default manner, 
; with equal iteration bands on the outside and blank black on the 
; inside, rates a 5.  This is an average rating; the image is an 
; average fractal.  The 11-minute render time from the parameter 
; file is somewhat excessive, but relief is always at hand at 
; Paul's web site:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or at Scott's site:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; where the finished GIF image will soon be posted.
; 
; The weather on Monday was uneventful here at Fractal Central.  
; The partly cloudy skies, light winds, and temperature of 54F 12C 
; made for a pleasant enough afternoon as the dynamic ones checked 
; and explored the yard, finding nothing out of the ordinary in 
; the process.
; 
; It's now Tuesday morning and sun is once again illuminating the 
; area.  I've got a bit of work to accomplish before I can call it 
; a day, so until tomorrow and the next FOTD, take care, and has 
; anyone considered a fractal chess set?
