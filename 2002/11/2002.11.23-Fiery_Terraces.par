; FOTD -- November 23, 3002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The fractal adventures today are still taking place in the 
; giant claw, this time on the biting edge of the upper claw, 
; where, a short distance inland, I found a two-way symmetry 
; which told me that a Mandelbrot atom was near.  Often, these 
; surface symmetries lead to what I call 'dry lakes', where the 
; symmetry ends in a blank, but in this case, a midget was indeed 
; waiting at the bottom of the pit.
; 
; It's not an outstanding midget, only an average one, with most 
; of the impact coming from the strong color palette.  Instead of 
; coloring the outside with the normal equal-iteration bands, I 
; have colored it with the < tdis > option, which creates the 
; fiery terraces surrounding the midget, and explains the name 
; "Fiery Terraces".
; 
; I have already described the image as average, and that is the 
; way I rated it.  The time from parameter file to finished image 
; is 8 minutes on my aging P200 machine.  The time required to 
; download the completed GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; is less than half the render time.
; 
; The dense fog early Friday lifted by late morning, leading to a 
; cloudy day with occasional sprinkles of rain.  The temperature 
; of 49F 9.5C was not enough to make up for the wet grass, leaving 
; the fractal cats with a boring indoor day.  A mid-afternoon 
; treat of turkey eased their irritation, but the day was not yet 
; finished.  A high wind arose at nightfall, which insured a 
; skittish evening.
; 
; As for me, I've got a bit of work to do before taking it easy 
; for the rest of the day.  I'm departing now, but I'll be back in 
; 24 hours with another (hopefully) awe-inspiring fractal from the 
; great beyond (wherever that is).  Until that glorious moment, 
; take care, and what's wrong with the philofractal list?
