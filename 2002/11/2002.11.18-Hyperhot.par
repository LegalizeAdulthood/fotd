; FOTD -- November 18, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image bears the name "Hyperhot".  The name is whimsical, 
; since nothing in the image gives the impression of heat.  The 
; image, with its disconnected features that appear to be 
; multiplying, actually resembles some sort of bacterial growth, 
; but a name such as "Festering" would not attract many viewers, 
; so I settled on the present name.
; 
; The parent fractal, which was created by subtracting 0.93 parts 
; of Z^(1.8) from 0.18 parts of Z^(-1.5), is shaped quite like a 
; gigantic lobster claw, so large that two outzooms are required 
; to fit it on the screen.  Today's scene is located in the 
; smaller arm of the big claw.
; 
; I could rate the image no higher than a 5.  But the giant claw 
; parent fractal holds many other interesting scenes, some of 
; which will appear in FOTD's soon to come, and will certainly 
; have a higher rating.
; 
; The render time of almost 1/2 hour on my machine is admittedly 
; excessive for an image that brings little new, and can be 
; avoided as always by downloading the completed GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; On and off rain, and a temperature of 41F 5C marred the cats' 
; day Sunday, but ample treats of tuna and turkey kept their 
; dispositions within the bearable range.  This morning, we 
; actually have a bit of sun, and a fresh breeze also.  If it 
; stays this way, the dynamic ones should have a pleasant 
; afternoon.
; 
; My afternoon will be pleasant when most of the work is behind 
; me.  I finished a good chunk of it yesterday, so my task should 
; not be too difficult.  Then it's on to the fractals.  Until 
; fractal Tuesday, (every day is a fractal day), take care, and 
; keep seeking for the deeper mysteries.
