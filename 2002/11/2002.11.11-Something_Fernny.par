; FOTD -- November 11, 2002 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; State-of-the-art hi-tech is great, but it can also be quite 
; annoying.  One of its more annoying aspects is the constant need 
; to 'upgrade'.  Hardly a week passes where I fail to receive a 
; file in a format that I cannot use.  It is most annoying to try 
; to load a file saved in super-publisher-36.2 format into version 
; 36.1 of the same program and get nothing but an error message.  
; Usually, a call to the customer only makes things worse, when I 
; find that the document contains features that only version 36.2 
; can produce.  Then I am faced with the choice of telling the 
; customer that I cannot handle the document unless he makes 
; changes, which he usually does not want to do, or spending 
; several hundred dollars to 'upgrade' to the latest version of 
; the super-publisher program.
; 
; It must be a plot of the forces of evil -- most likely an 
; invasion of off-world aliens set on bankrupting us so that we 
; will be unable to resist the coming takeover.  But I'm not 
; concerned.  We'll probably be better off once we have been taken 
; over.  ;-)
; 
; Today's fractal is certainly not bankrupt.  And I believe it is 
; the first time I have colored an image with the outside coloring 
; option set to < real >.  This option does nothing but add the 
; real part to the iteration count when a point escapes.  But at 
; least in today's case, it makes a surprising image.  I named the 
; picture "Something Fernny" when I had the impression of ferns 
; growing on a forest floor.
; 
; The iterated expression subtracts Z^(1.1) from Z^(-1.2) and adds 
; (1/C).  The resulting fractal consists of several large open 
; areas, only one of which is an obvious Mandeloid.  This 
; Mandeloid is rotated -90 degrees so that its main bud points 
; south and its East Valley lies on its north side.  Today's scene 
; is located in a small area of cut-off debris in the interior of 
; this East Valley.
; 
; I have rated the image at an 8.  I was undecided on a 7 or an 8. 
; Since the image appears somewhat different from my usual fare, 
; and because of its 'illuminated from behind' effect, I finally 
; decided on the rating of 8.
; 
; The render time of under 2 minutes is surprisingly fast for the 
; scene.  The potential viewer may become an actual viewer by 
; running the attached parameter file and enjoying the gradual 
; appearance of the image, or by downloading the completed image 
; from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and missing some of the enjoyment.
; 
; The Sunday weather was quite mild here at F.C., but heavy clouds 
; obscured the afternoon sun, and a few sprinkles of rain dampened 
; the grass enough to make things a bit unpleasant for the fractal 
; duo.  Being courageous cats, they endured their displeasure 
; stoically, taking their comfort in the temperature of 71F 22C.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy again, and to make things worse, it is 
; raining and there is a tornado watch in effect.  I have a fresh 
; supply of work that could keep me busy until nightfall if I 
; don't get busy on it.  Since I would like to be finished before 
; nightfall, I had best get started.  As for the cats, they will 
; have to shift for themselves.  Until next FOTD in 24 hours, take 
; iterative care, and keep iterating.
