; FOTD -- November 09, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's much improved image we rise out of the abysmal 
; depths of yesterday's failed attempt to find fractal worth.  
; Today's image rates a 6, which is actually a bit above average.  
; It's not too great a jump, but it's better than nothing.
; 
; I named the picture "Intaglio".  I can give no definite reason 
; for choosing such a name.  The word simply came to mind when I 
; studied the image, which actually resembles thinly stretched 
; blueish cloths more than a carved image.
; 
; The iterated expression that drew the image combines some 
; Z^(-2.5) with about one-tenth as much Z^3, then adds (1/C).  The 
; parent fractal is a bloated Mandeloid with its nose to the east, 
; on the verge of exploding and turning inside-out.
; 
; The numbers catch the parent at a point where its sides have 
; ballooned out to grotesque proportions, leaving the 'main' 
; period-2 bud with its straight stem virtually invisible.  Though 
; the stem is small, it is there however, and scattered fractal 
; debris lies beyond its tip.  Today's midget lies near a larger 
; midget that lies in this debris, just beyond the tip of the stem 
; of its parent.
; 
; When rendered with my usual outside=equal-iteration-band method, 
; today's scene has little to note.  But in today's image I have 
; set the outside to < tdis >, a method that colors the points 
; according to how far they have travelled before escaping.  This, 
; along with some serendipitous coloring, raised the ordinarily 
; humdrum scene from a rating of 5 to one of 6.
; 
; The render time of today's image on my P200 machine ranges from 
; 1min 7sec with a clean boot to 1min 25sec with all the 
; peripheral drivers loaded.  Either way it's a fast render.  The 
; download of the completed image is just as fast however, and may 
; be found on the internet at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The Friday weather was sunny and mild, with a cat-pleasing 
; temperature of 61F 16C.  Accordingly, the cats were pleased.  
; The aging ones spent several hours in the yard, attempting to 
; romp, but actually spending more time sleeping, occasionally 
; waking only long enough to shift position to follow the ever-
; moving patches of sunlight.  I spent the day wrapping up another 
; week's work.
; 
; Today is starting sunny and even warmer, and for a change I 
; have no work waiting.  It should be an interesting day.  To see 
; how interesting, check back in 24 hours for the next FOTD.  
; Until then, take care, and keep your fractal side up.
