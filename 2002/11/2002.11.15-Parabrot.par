; FOTD -- November 15, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have named today's image "Parabrot" because in my opinion it 
; lies just a little beyond the normal fractal scene.  (Whether my 
; opinion agrees with the opinions of others is another story.)  
; The parent was found by the Fractint evolver feature, which IMO 
; is one of the program's best features.  The parent was created 
; by combining portions of two different negative powers of Z, in 
; this case, Z^(-1.6) and Z^(-3.6), then adding (1/C).
; 
; This parent is an indescribable thing consisting of many bays 
; filled with islands, with a large irregular ring extending to 
; the east and north.  Today's scene is located in a spiral at the 
; southern origin of this ring, near the point where the ring 
; vanishes into the center of a Mandeloid valley.
; 
; The image itself is one of unusual smoothness, though this 
; smoothness cannot be fully displayed with a palette of only 256 
; colors.  The color bands are not arranged consecutively.  The 
; iteration count alternates back and forth in a curious manner, 
; which might be natural or might be an artifact of the math 
; routine.
; 
; The rating of a 7 could be a bit overblown, but the image is at 
; least a little above average.  The render time of a little less 
; than 15 minutes can be avoided by downloading the finished image 
; from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Thursday turned out to be very pleasant, with lots 
; of sun and a temperature of 61F 16C.  Accordingly, the cats were 
; so pleased that they finished the day with a purr.
; 
; And I finished the article in "Skeptical Inquirer" magazine.  I 
; found it to be rather routine, containing little new debunking 
; material.  Basically, it re-stated the obvious fact that before 
; the existence of PSI can be assumed from experimental results, 
; all the other things that might possibly have caused the small 
; discrepancy from chance should be eliminated.  Since it is 
; impossible to totally eliminate all the other things that could 
; possibly influence the outcome of such PSI experiments, the 
; world-view of the 'hard skeptics' is still safe, and they will 
; not need to admit the possibility of the existence of the 
; paranormal.
; 
; As for me, I am now forced to admit the existence of the work on 
; the shelf, which must shortly be finished.  It's time to get 
; busy, so until next FOTD, take care, and be cautious with feral 
; fractals.
