; FOTD -- November 24, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The color flap on the Fractint list appears to be winding down.  
; Not surprisingly, it turned out that we were all saying much 
; the same thing in different words.  Like the sound of the tree 
; falling in the forest, the answer to the question of whether 
; color exists before it is observed depends on the meaning given 
; to the word 'color'.
; 
; Today's emerald-colored image, which is surprisingly three-
; dimensional, vaguely resembles many things.  I could have given 
; it many names, but the name I decided on is "Gills".  I rendered 
; this otherwise routine scene with the outside set to < tdis >, 
; which colors the points according to the total distance 
; travelled before escaping.  The normal equal-iteration-band 
; rendering of the same scene draws a worthwhile image, but one 
; that is not nearly as striking as today's < tdis > version.
; 
; The parent fractal was created by adding 3.7 parts of Z^(-6.5) 
; to 4.9 parts of Z^(-1.83).  It is a three-lobed thing composed 
; of mostly non-critical features.  A small critical area does 
; appear on the eastern end of the figure however, and in this 
; area lies a bud with a curved filament extending from it.  
; Today's image is located out near the tip of the filament, near 
; one of the many nodes that lie on it.
; 
; Due to its striking emerald coloration, I have, perhaps a bit 
; liberally, rated the image at a 7.  The render time of 5 minutes 
; is within reason, which helps justify the rating.  Those who 
; want still more justice in the rating may download the completed 
; GIF image from one of the two FOTD web sites.

; 
; The weather was brisk here at Fractal Central on Saturday.  The 
; sun shone at intervals between scudding clouds, but the wind 
; roared and the temperature stopped rising at 44F 6.5C.  The 
; cats, who could endure only a few minutes of such conditions, 
; complained mildly, then settled by their favorite radiators.
; 
; Today is starting better, though it's still a bit brisk.  Time 
; will tell how the day will turn out.  Regardless of how things 
; develop, I'll return in 24 hours with the next in the unending 
; series of FOTD's.  Until that eagerly awaited moment, take care, 
; and if fractals are made of numbers, why not superstrings?  I 
; kind of like the idea of the universe being made of numbers, but 
; if this is the case, where do the numbers come from? . . . 
; 
; . . . And what about those membranes of M-theory? . . .
; 
; . . . Perhaps I ask too many questions. . . .
