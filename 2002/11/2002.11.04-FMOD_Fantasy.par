; FOTD -- November 04, 2002 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's highly-rated image "FMOD Fantasy".  I gave it 
; the name because the scene is an evaporated all-inside one that 
; consists entirely of < fmod > inside fill.  Without the fill, 
; the scene would be a total blank.
; 
; I do not know exactly how the < fmod > fill works.  I assume it 
; measures some distance, but however it works, it works quite 
; well with today's screen-full of trapped points.  (The < bof61 > 
; fill also produces a fractal rather than a blank screen, though 
; the image produced by the < fmod > fill is by far the better.
; 
; The parent fractal, which adds Z^(-0.25) to Z^(0.25), can hardly 
; be called a fractal, for it also consists entirely of trapped 
; inside points.  With the < fmod > fill applied to it, the parent 
; consists of a large crescent with the horns pointing east, the 
; edges of the crescent lined with buds.  Today's scene is located 
; in the valley area of one of the second-order buds.
; 
; When coloring the image, I used a little more care than usual.  
; It shows in the result.  One of the reasons I consider my FOTD 
; images to be mathematical curiosities rather than works of art 
; is that I so often lack the time to find and refine the best 
; color palette for the images.  I cannot consider something on 
; which I do less than my best to be a work of art.
; 
; But as mathematical curiosities, some FOTD images are truly 
; unique.  This is not surprising, since fractals themselves are 
; unique.  They come from nowhere, exist for a few brief moments, 
; and unless recorded, return to whence they came.  
; 
; Though the appearance of today's image departs from that of my 
; typical images, I rated it at an exceptional 8.  The parameter 
; file takes 14 minutes to run on my tired old machine.  The GIF 
; file of the completed image takes only a minute to download from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Running the parameter file is more fun; downloading the image is 
; more convenient.
; 
; The near ideal weather here at Fractal Central on Sunday 
; resulted in reasonably happy cats.  They approved of the few 
; patches of sunlight that filtered through the holly trees, and 
; they approved of the light winds.  They would have preferred the 
; temperature to have been a few degrees higher than 52F 11C, but 
; they held their complaints to a minimum.  Their moods remained 
; adequate well beyond their evening meal time.
; 
; Today's weather will be similar, though with a few more clouds.  
; The cats' day will likely be similar also.  Until tomorrow, when 
; the next glorious FOTD will appear, take care and be mod but not 
; fmod.
