; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have named today's image "The Bluest Atom".  One glance at the 
; image will reveal why the atom in the picture is the bluest.  
; The atom is the midget at the center of the frame.  Mandelbrot 
; midgets are sometimes called atoms, as well as Minibrots.
; 
; Actual atoms, the kind that the world is composed of, have no 
; color.  They are far too small.  An object's color is determined 
; by the wave length of the visible light that it reflects most 
; strongly.  But atoms do not reflect light at all.  Light waves 
; are far larger than an atom, and pass by it as though it were 
; not there.  A deeper question is whether the particles atoms are 
; made of are there at all.  One would assume something is there 
; . . . but is it? . . .
; 
; The parent of today's image appears as a large irregular 
; Mandeloid bay, with a secondary Mandeloid off to the east.  The 
; East Valley of this secondary Mandeloid, which is actually on 
; the north shore, is split down the middle by a cleft that is 
; just starting to open.  Today's scene is located in a spiral in 
; a weed-choked cove near the shore of this cleft.
; 
; The image is broken, much of it consisting of featureless black 
; inside areas.  I normally try to avoid such broken areas in my 
; fractal searches, but sometimes these areas produce unexpectedly 
; fine fractals.  In today's image, the black areas actually add 
; to the overall somber feeling of the scene.
; 
; I have rated the image at an average 5.  Its feeling of sadness 
; holds it down.  If the color palette had been cheerier, I might 
; have rated the picture at a 6.  The render time of 28 minutes is 
; unreasonably long for such a gloomy image.  To avoid impatience, 
; the download from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; is recommended.
; 
; It rained steadily all day Saturday here at Fractal Central, 
; keeping the dynamic cats confined to the indoors, where they 
; passed the day in a very un-dynamic fashion.  The temperature of 
; 47F 8C did not help at all.  Luckily for me, I had stocked lots 
; of tuna and turkey, which kept their bad moods under control.  
; Today is starting just as rainy as yesterday, so I'll likely 
; have to repeat the treats.
; 
; As for myself, I'm bored with watching rain, yard work is 
; impossible and driving is miserable.  After I get a head start 
; on this week's design work, I'll probably reduce myself to 
; watching a game or two on TV and trying to keep the cats happy.  
; The best part of the day will come later, when I shift into my 
; fractal-hunting mode and bring one back alive.  Until next time, 
; which will arrive in 24 hours, take care, and are fractals alive 
; or dead?  Secondary question: can something that has never been 
; alive be considered dead?
