; FOTD -- November 25, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal, which mixes fractional parts of Z^(101) and 
; Z^(-1.5), is a picture of another midget lying in a valley of 
; its parent.  And the parent is another indescribable fractal 
; with a critical area filled with bits and pieces of Mandel-
; material, where the midgets are found.
; 
; In response to these undeniable facts, I have named the image 
; "Just Another Midget".  I rated it at only an average 5.  I 
; know of no reason for the merely average rating.  The colors 
; might be a bit too brilliant, but fractals can look good with 
; bright colors.  I am simply dis-satisfied in some way.
; 
; Why do I feel this vague dis-satisfaction with today's image?  
; Nothing is wrong with midgets, (Minibrots, atoms).  They are 
; among the most interesting of fractal objects.  But though their 
; number is infinite, they comprise only a tiny part of the vast 
; universe of fractals.  Could I finally be becoming bored with 
; midgets?  A couple years ago I went an entire month without 
; featuring a midget in the FOTD.  Perhaps I need another such 
; break.
; 
; Perhaps I need to return to the preoccupation with four-dimen-
; sional figures and the curiosities of four-dimensional space 
; that filled the FOTD discussions a couple years ago, when I 
; posted many images of odd slices of the 4-D Julibrot figure.
; 
; The Seahorse Valley area of the Mandelbrot set is perhaps the 
; richest area of that best-known of all fractals.  Its Julia sets 
; are among the finest the M-set has to offer.  But in addition to 
; Julia sets, the four-dimensional Seahorse Valley area can be 
; sliced to create Oblate sets, Rectangular sets, Elliptic sets 
; and Parabolic sets.  These less-familiar sets illustrate slices 
; through Seahorse Valley in the remaining four mutually-perpendi-
; cular directions of 4-D space, and they are quite rich in an 
; entirely new way.
; 
; I think I will make December the month of the fourth dimension.  
; The images will feature odd slices of the Z^2+C Julibrot, and 
; the discussions will tell of the curiosities of 4-D space.  Mini-
; brot lovers need feel no concern.  When the new year arrives, 
; the Minibrots will return, though not in the nearly exclusive 
; manner of the past year or so.
; 
; Today's image, which I have almost forgotten in my hyperspace 
; ramblings, renders in under 10 minutes on my tired old fractal-
; workhorse P-200 machine.  The file of the completed GIF image 
; downloads in only a minute from one of the following two web 
; sites:

; 
; The weather Sunday here in the Fractal Central part of the world 
; was near perfect, with full sun, light breezes, and a tempera-
; ture of 59F 15C.  The cats were happy and so was I.  No treats 
; were needed.
; 
; Today is promising to be a repeat, except that I now have a pile 
; of work before me.  Actually, it's a virtual pile, since the 
; work is contained on a computer disk.  When the work is 
; finished, the fractals will appear, and one of them will be the 
; FOTD for tomorrow.  Until that serene moment, take care, and 
; beware of rogue fractals lurking in the shadows.
