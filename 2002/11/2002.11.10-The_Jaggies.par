; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Take one negative portion of Z^(-8.5), add to it eight negative 
; portions of Z^(-1.5), then add (1/C), iterate one-thousand times 
; and display a critical plane.  What do you get?  You get the 
; parent fractal of today's image.
; 
; This parent is beyond verbal description.  It is filled with a 
; larger variety of fractal features than a fractal cat has 
; tricks.  Basically, this fractal is a large multi-lobed 
; Mandeloid surrounded by scattered smaller disconnected 
; Mandeloids.  Today's image is located near the tip of a filament 
; extending from a bud of the northernmost bay of the main 
; Mandeloid.
; 
; The filament itself has a curiously jagged nature.  This 
; jaggedness is reflected in the filaments surrounding the midget 
; in today's image.  The whole image appears to have a case of the 
; jaggies, which inspired (if it can be called inspiration) the 
; name "The Jaggies".  There is also a vaguely sinister and 
; threatening aura about the image, which creates a feeling of 
; unease suitable for the design of a cover for a paperback horror 
; novel.
; 
; The image is of average quality; I rated it at a 5.
; 
; The render time of 6 minutes is a bit slow for a merely average 
; image.  A download of the completed image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; is the better choice.
; 
; As a brief off-topic comment, I have noticed the nature of 
; sounds being discussed on the Fractint list recently.  The 
; question arose of what is the shortest sound duration in which a 
; definite pitch or frequency can be discerned.  The question has 
; been tossed around a bit, but to my knowledge no one has yet 
; mentioned the reverberation aspect.  A sound must have a 
; duration of at least one cycle (hertz) for the concept of 
; frequency to make sense.  But even a sound burst of one cycle 
; will produce reverberations lasting many cycles.  It is these 
; reverberations that give the effect of pitch to sounds such as 
; the tapping of a pencil on a desk.  The ear tends to ignore 
; these reverberations and notice only the initial impact, but if 
; the tapping is recorded on tape and played backward, the 
; importance of the reverberations to the perceived sound of the 
; tapping is immediately obvious.
; 
; The closest we can come to a sound without reverberation is an 
; electronically produced and recorded sound heard through an 
; earphone headset, but even here, the ear and headset itself 
; create some echo.  A pure one-cycle tone heard without echo 
; appears to be an unreachable ideal.
; 
; The Saturday weather here at F.C. featured no sharp sound 
; transients, which would have scared the cats, but it did feature 
; lots of sunshine, which pleased them.  The temperature of 64F 
; 18C pleased them even more.  Since happy cats make for a happy 
; day, it was a better-than-average day.
; 
; Today is starting with less sun, but it is still warm.  How the 
; cats will take these conditions remains to be seen.  Until next 
; time, which will arrive with little fanfare in 24 hours, take 
; care, and keep the fractal faith.
