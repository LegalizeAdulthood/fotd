; FOTD -- January 30, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image features a Mandelbrot midget surrounded by a 
; glowing amber spiral with many arms.  I named the picture 
; "Amberesque" and rated it a 7.  Its render time of just under 
; 20 minutes on a tired old Pentium 200 mhz machine, or around 
; 5 minutes on the fastest machines, can be avoided by letting 
; Scott do the rendering and downloading the completed image 
; from his web site at:
; 
;         <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Paul's site is still not updated.
; 
; Paul's web site still sits as he left it just before Christmas.  
; It's been long enough since we last heard from him that some 
; concern is justified.  But his web site is still up, and I guess 
; that's a good sign.
; 
; But now I'm not sure how long his site will stay up, and a few 
; of the FOTD discussions of a couple years ago were lost when I 
; suffered a disk crash.  They now exist only on Paul's site.  The 
; problem is that I don't know exactly which FOTD's are missing 
; and need to be downloaded for the FOTD compact disk that I still 
; have in mind.  It will take quite a while to search through my 
; archives to determine which FOTD's are missing, because the 
; missing ones are scattered over a two-year period and the FOTD's 
; of that period are still almost hopelessly mixed in with other 
; old e-mail.  I'll have to laboriously go through my old files 
; to determine which discussions are missing, and download them 
; from Paul's site while the site is still up.  If a few FOTD's 
; are late or missing in the near future, you'll know that the job 
; has become more difficult than I imagine.
; 
; The fractal weather Tuesday was like a June day in January here 
; at Fractal central.  (In the southern hemisphere it would have 
; been like a January day in June.)  The temperature reached 75F 
; 24C, the sky was hazy but sunny, and the winds were light.  
; Needless to say, the fractal cats were in heaven, and showed it 
; by behaving like angels.
; 
; I now find myself with a few tasks that need to be done.  So I 
; guess it's time to throw the switch and go into work mode.  I'll 
; return on schedule at about this same time tomorrow.  Until 
; then, take care and be an angel, but don't be too angelic for 
; your own good.
