; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I opened my e-mailbox this morning, I found the usual pile 
; of unwanted spam.  I deleted all but one of the letters at once 
; without reading them.  The subject of the one letter I hesitated 
; to delete told me that I could get a bigger hammer.  When I saw 
; this, I rushed to the tool rack in the basement to see if I 
; needed a bigger hammer.  I found that I already had five hammers 
; and had no need for another big hammer, so I returned to my 
; computer and deleted the final piece of spam.  This is the first 
; time anyone has tried to sell me a hammer by e-mail.
; 
; Today's fractal I did not delete.  The image is one of a tiny 
; midget on the negative stem of the Mandelbrot set, pictured 
; under unusual conditions.  The first unusual condition is that 
; in today's image, the bailout radius has been set to 3.  Such a 
; small bailout radius means that some of the M-set is cut off, 
; but it also means that strange things happen to the remaining 
; parts which happen to lie very near the reduced bailout radius.
; 
; The second unusual (at least for me) condition is that the 
; outside parts of the image have been colored by the <fmod> 
; algorithm, with the proximity set to an unusually low 0.003.  
; This is what gives the image its resemblance to a wheel with 
; spider webs strung between the spokes.  And the resemblance to a 
; wheel with spider webs is what inspired the name "Web Wheel".  
; The image is not named for the semi-abstraction known as the 
; Worldwide Web.
; 
; Due to its unusual nature, the image rates a lofty 8, which 
; makes it almost worth the 26 minutes required to run the 
; parameter file.  The image is more than worth the minute or two 
; required to download it from Scott's web site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; I have not yet checked to see if Paul Lee's web site has been 
; updated.  So I will not include the address of his web site.
; 
; The fractal weather Monday here at Fractal Central started 
; threatening, with clouds and a heavy flurry of snow, but shortly 
; after noon the sun appeared and the temperature shot up to 45F 
; 7C.  Most of the snow already on the ground had melted by 
; nightfall, but not in time to please the cats, who once again 
; had to content themselves with the consolational treat of tuna.
; 
; Today, however, appears headed for far more cat-friendly 
; conditions.  Hopefully, I can finish the modicum of serious work 
; in time to give them a lengthy romp in the yard.  Until 
; tomorrow, same time, same place, new fractal, take care, and 
; when the going gets tough, fractals are always there.
