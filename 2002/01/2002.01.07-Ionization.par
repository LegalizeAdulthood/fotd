; FOTD -- January 07, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal features a fancy midget set before a dark 
; background, with an electric blue glow surrounding the elements. 
; When I noticed this glow, I named the image "Ionization".  It's 
; a rather intricate image, which exists in the fractal that 
; results when 0.05 parts of Z^(-15) are added to 5 parts of 1/Z.
; 
; It's a striking image when first seen, a feature that earns it a 
; rating of 6.  And the total lack of branch-cut discontinuities 
; raises that rating to a 7.  If the render time were less than 
; almost a half-hour, the image might even have rated an 8.
; 
; The half-hour delay in viewing the image can be avoided by 
; downloading the finished GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; If it's not at one site, try the other.
; 
; The weather Sunday here at F.C. was totally miserable, 
; especially for cats.  A cold, windy rain that set in at midday 
; continued uninterrupted all afternoon, and changed to snow at 
; night.  The snow accumulated only 1 cm before ending, but the 
; damage had already been done, and I was left with cranky cats to 
; deal with.  Luckily, when the cats got their tuna treat, they 
; forgot their bad moods.
; 
; It's now 10am of Monday, and though I am not loaded with work, I 
; have enough to keep me busy a couple hours.  Then, if I'm lucky, 
; I'll find time before I start the search for the next fractal to 
; think about something enjoyable such as the latest interpreta-
; tion of quantum mechanics, whatever that is, (we get a couple 
; new ones every year).  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours or 
; less.  Until then, take care, and we don't even know what we 
; don't know, yet some will tell us that we know it all.
