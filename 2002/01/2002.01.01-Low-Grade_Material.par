; 
; FOTD -- January 01, 2002 (Rating 1)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In honor of the first day of the second year of the 21st 
; century, we have an image that rates an almost, but not quite, 
; worthless 1.  I think this is the lowest rating yet for a FOTD.
; 
; The image shows a scene in the chaos that exists along the 
; shoreline of the Z^1.009+C Mandeloid, 965 levels up the 
; logarithmic spiral.  There is no midget in the image, for 
; midgets are virtually impossible to find in fractals created by 
; expressions so close to linear.  There is only disorganized 
; fractal material.
; 
; Recognizing this fact, I named the image "Low-Grade Material".  
; I'll not venture into metaphysical realms by speculating on the 
; reality of the material.  I'll simply show a picture of it and 
; let the viewer decide for him/her self.
; 
; It can be seen that even though a formula is so close to just 
; plain Z^1, the resulting image can be filled with features that 
; are neither totally chaotic nor totally organized.
; 
; The render time of 26 minutes on my 200mhz machine with the 
; laboring fan will be far less on a faster machine.  But who is 
; going to bother rendering the least impressive FOTD image of all 
; time.  I recommend letting Paul and Scott do the suffering, and 
; downloading the completed GIF image from their web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Monday was sunny but blustery and cold.  
; Once again the temperature failed to rise above freezing, and 
; once again the cats hopes of a pleasant day outdoors were 
; stifled.  When I let them sample the air beyond the north-facing 
; front door, their noses were back inside before their tails were 
; out.  Content to remain warm, they settled in their blankets on 
; the floor by the radiator.
; 
; And now, I'm going to try to have a relaxing day.  If I'm 
; successful, I'll be back in 24 hours with the next FOTD.  If I'm 
; not successful, I'll be back in 24 hours anyway.  Until then, 
; take care, and with a FOTD rating of 1 to start the year, things 
; can only get better.
