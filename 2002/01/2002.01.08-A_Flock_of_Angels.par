; 
; FOTD -- January 08, 2002 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There are angels in today's image -- four golden fractal angels 
; hovering around the midget at the center of the scene.  Four 
; does not exactly make a flock, but a closer look will reveal 
; four smaller angels lurking between the large ones.  Eight does 
; make a small flock, so I named the image "A Flock of Angels".  
; The gold of the angels on the the dark blue of the celestial sky 
; creates an image worth the rating of 8.
; 
; I do not know which species of angel today's angels belong to.  
; According to tradition, angels come in 7 varieties.  Rated from 
; highest to lowest, they are: Cherubim, Seraphim, Thrones, 
; Dominions, Powers, Archangels, and Angels.  The Jinn are up 
; there also, though I have no idea where they fit in.
; 
; Do I believe in angels of the physical, or more accurately, of 
; the celestial kind?  Well, I do not dis-believe in them.  That 
; is as far as I will commit myself on the topic, though I shall 
; give a further hint by telling that, even at the risk of being 
; seen as superstitious, I do not consider myself bound by the 
; limits of common sense.
; 
; After that not surprising admission, it's time to reveal that 
; the parent fractal of today's image was created by adding Z^5.9 
; to Z^3.1, then adding C.  Today's image is located in a cut-off 
; feature of the parent.  This cut-off feature resembles nothing 
; as much as a cockroach.
; 
; The best feature of all is the light-speed render time of the 
; parameter file.  Using the passes=b algorithm, which works with 
; this particular image, the parameter file runs in 48 seconds on 
; my weary machine.  It will probably run faster than the speed of 
; light on a state-of-the-art 1.5 ghz unit, if one can be found 
; with a Fractint-friendly video card.
; 
; BTW, I avoid the Fractint-Windows incompatibility by booting DOS 
; 6.22 from a disk in the A drive when I run Fractint.  If the 
; video card supports the vesa modes, the fractals work perfectly. 
; True, a number of Windows drivers do not get loaded when I do 
; this, but when searching for fractals, I never need the 
; inaccessible devices.
; 
; With today's image having a render time of 48 seconds, going 
; online is the least efficient way of viewing the scene.  But it 
; is still fun to visit Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and download the image from there.
; 
; The fractal weather Monday was cloudy and blustery with 
; occasional flurries of snow and a temperature around 32F 0C.  
; The cats complained, then resigned themselves to a day by the 
; radiators.
; 
; And I must resign myself to at least a part day of work.  But 
; I'll return on schedule in 24 hours with another fractal.  Until 
; then, take care, and be angelic.
