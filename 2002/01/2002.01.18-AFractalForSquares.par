; FOTD -- January 18, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image can be rendered using either conventional math or 
; arbitrary precision math.  Conventional math finishes the image 
; in 14 minutes on my machine.  If I switched to arbitrary 
; precision math the image would take 24 hours.  Since the 
; advantage of the more accurate math is minimal, I have included 
; an entry in the parameter file that will force the use of the 
; much faster conventional math.
; 
; The image features a tiny midget that lies in the seventh valley 
; out of the large period-2 north bud of the Mandelbrot set.  I 
; named the image "A Fractal for Squares" because only a 'square' 
; (an old-fashioned term for someone who is not hip to the trends 
; of the times) would still waste time looking at fractals as 
; old-fashioned as the Mandelbrot set, using a 15-year-old fractal 
; generating program that runs under an obsolete operating system. 
; Then I realized that I had just described myself.
; 
; In frustration, I sighed and rated the image at a 5.
; 
; The true logmap setting of the image is 11594.  This is the 
; logmap I found by entering a 2, which causes the program to scan 
; the border and calculate the image using the lowest iteration it 
; finds there.  But today's image is tricky, and when it is 
; calculated at its true logmap setting, most of the color bands 
; are wasted on tiny areas in the corners.  I found that raising 
; the logmap to around 17000 gives a far better rendering, and 
; finally settled on 17010.
; 
; Overall, the image is an unusually delicate and feathery one, 
; given perhaps un-necessary weight by the heavy colors.  It's 
; worth the 14-minute render time.  It is not worth the 24-hour 
; render time.  Both waits can be avoided however by giving Scott 
; a chance to render and post the image on his web site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Hopefully, he'll use the fast method of rendering, or else the 
; image will not be ready until tomorrow.
; 
; The FOTD images will once again be posted to Paul's web site 
; when and if he re-appears.
; 
; The fractal weather, (everything at Fractal Central is 
; 'fractal'), here Thursday was non-eventful.  The mostly cloudy 
; skies, moderate winds and temperature of 52F 11C would have gone 
; un-noticed and un-remembered by human observers other than 
; weather forecasters, but cats are not human, and the fractal 
; cats were not happy with these routine conditions.  They 
; expressed their unhappiness by getting into two scuffles, and 
; did not settle down until I gave them a double treat of tuna.
; 
; The cats are now settled, all else is well, and it's time to get 
; busy on other things.  The fractal shoppe will now become a 
; graphic design office.  Until next time, take care and stay 
; settled.
