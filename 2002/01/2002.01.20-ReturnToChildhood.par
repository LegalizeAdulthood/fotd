; FOTD -- January 20, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's meager effort "Return to Childhood".  I gave it 
; this name because it's part of the Mandelbrot set, which is the 
; first fractal I ever saw, and it resembles the kind of fractals 
; I found back in the late 1980's, when I was just getting started 
; in my fractal adventures.  I was not exactly a child back then, 
; but it was a time when even simple fractals held a real magic -- 
; the magic of newness.
; 
; Actually, like a child, I spent too much time Saturday on the 
; internet watching the progress of the so-called snowstorm, and 
; not enough time exploring fractal-land.  As a result, I was 
; forced to fall back on the M-set for my FOTD.  Today's image is 
; not exactly like those of 1988 however.  It's magnitude is over 
; 10^19, which puts it well beyond where I could go in the good 
; old days, though the render time of just under 2 hours is on a 
; par with the render times of the early days.
; 
; Being distracted by the snow, I gave almost no effort to the 
; coloring of the image, which with proper coloring might rate as 
; high as a 6.  Those with snow to shovel will have time to run 
; the parameter file while they do their shoveling.  Others will 
; want to download the finished GIF image from Scott's web site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather here at Fractal Central on Saturday was 
; snowy, with a bit of sleet mixed in during the warmest part of 
; the day, when the temperature reached 32F 0C.  A total of 3-1/2 
; inches (9cm) of snow fell, which, compared to the forecasts, 
; wasn't all that bad.  But it was definitely anti-cat weather.  
; The fractal cats checked the outdoors several times, and they 
; actually appeared happy to be inside for a change.
; 
; As for myself, I now have a sidewalk to clear, and I had best 
; get started before the sun melts the meager accumulation and I 
; miss out on the fun.  Until next time, when I actually might 
; philosophize, take care, and enjoy yourself.
