; FOTD -- January 15, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is yet another view of the same Julibrot hole that 
; appeared in the past three FOTD's.  However, this view is 
; centered on a different point of the Julibrot hole.  The three 
; previous slices cut the hole through its main bud, while today's 
; slice cuts through the East Valley area.  
; 
; This particular slice resembles nothing as much as a flying 
; gateway with its two doors open.  In fact, I named the image 
; "Flying Gateway".  I have no idea what the open gateway might 
; lead to, though I expect it is a dead end.  Due to the dead end 
; perhaps, today's image rates another lowly 4.
; 
; The center pillar that separates the two open doors of today's 
; image is actually the East Valley of the Mandelbrot-midget 
; aspect of this Julibrot hole.  And like all east valleys, it is 
; infested with elephants.  Some of these elephants are real 
; work-horses, or work-elephants in this case, and tomorrow's FOTD 
; will feature a few of these hard-working pachyderms.
; 
; After that, it will be back to the M-Mix4 midgets.
; 
; Perhaps the best feature of today's image is its 50-second 
; render time.  If the image is below average, I feel it's best to 
; keep the render time short.  The rendering can be avoided 
; entirely by downloading the finished image from either:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; With a temperature of 47F 8C, the fractal weather today here at 
; Fractal Central was mild enough -- the entire winter has been 
; mild -- but the wind was blowing, and that kept the fractal cats 
; safely ensconced indoors.  They were surprisingly good natured 
; about their confinement however, even getting into a playful 
; tussle under the table.
; 
; It's now time to check out that latest e-mail letter.  
; Apparently, someone in Nigeria has several million dollars of 
; left-over petroleum money that they want to park in my bank 
; account.  How lucky can one person be!  My greed is showing!  
; I get to keep 1/3 of the money!  As long as they don't ask me to 
; put up 'good faith' money, or ask for my personal financial 
; information, which they certainly will do, I could be a 
; millionaire within a week.  Until the next FOTD venture into the 
; fourth dimension, which will come in 24 hours, take care, and 
; don't get scammed by such scams.
