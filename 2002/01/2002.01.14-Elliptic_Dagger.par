; 
; FOTD -- January 14, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD, which is yet another aspect of the same midget 
; that appeared in the past two days' FOTD's, could have been 
; named something like "Hypodermic Needle" or "Mosquito 
; Proboscis", but such names lack the immediate impact of 
; "Elliptic Dagger", the name that I gave the image.
; 
; How, one might ask, can a dagger be elliptic?  Daggers are 
; supposed to be short, pointed knives with both edges sharpened.  
; Well, the dagger in today's image, like nearly everything else 
; in FOTD fractals, exists only in the mind of the beholder, and 
; therefore can seen as anything the originator and beholder 
; desire.  (But perhaps fractals exist also only in the mind of 
; the beholder.  And the beholder . . . where does he exist . . . 
; if he exists at all?)
; 
; A dagger can be elliptic when it is a slice of a Julibrot hole 
; sliced in the Elliptic direction, which is defined by 
; real(c)imag(z), when the slice looks even remotely like a 
; dagger.  Today's image meets these qualifications, thus the 
; name.  (I named this particular Julibrot orientation 'Elliptic' 
; because the slice in this orientation through the origin of the 
; Z^2+C Julibrot vaguely resembles an ellipse flattened on one 
; end.)
; 
; Unfortunately, the remnant seen in today's FOTD image resembles 
; hundreds of perturbed Mandelbrot midgets that I have found and 
; discarded, so I could rate it no higher than a 4.  But it's 
; still worth the incredibly short time required to render the 
; image from the attached parameter file.
; 
; The color palette is the same one that appeared in the past two 
; days' FOTD views of this particular scene.
; 
; On my rejuvenated P200, the 21-second render time of today's 
; fractal rivals yesterday's record breaker.  The download of the 
; GIF image file takes a bit longer, but is also more convenient.  
; The download may be found at one of the following two sites on 
; the W.W.Web:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a temperature of 45F 7C, the Sunday weather here at Fractal 
; Central was sunny and mild enough, but the high winds kept the 
; fractal cats house-bound.  They passed the day sleeping by the 
; radiator, waking only long enough to give me a few angry 
; glances.  The standard tuna treat finally put them in a more 
; congenial mood.
; 
; Well, it's Monday morning and another week of work has started.  
; I find myself with only a minor stack of work at the moment, but 
; that could change at the ring of a telephone.  Until next time 
; and next FOTD, take care, and the Mandelbrot set is as close to 
; an indestructible object as it is possible to come in this or 
; any other world.
