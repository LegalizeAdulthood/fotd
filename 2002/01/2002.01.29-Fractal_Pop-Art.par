; FOTD -- January 29, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image has a pop-art look, so I named it "Fractal 
; Pop-Art".  The image is a scene in the fractal that results when 
; 0.15 parts of Z^(-14.56) are added to 1.5 parts of Z^(-1.456), 
; and then (1/C) is added to the whole thing.
; 
; The parent fractal is an oversized, many-bayed thing with an 
; object that vaguely resembles a main stem extending northeast 
; from one of the bays.  Today's scene is found near the end of 
; this rudimentary stem, where it merges with a scalloped disk.
; 
; Being a fractal purist, and considering equal-iteration bands to 
; be purity, I saw it as almost a sacrilege when I turned on 
; Fractint's 'biomorph' feature.  But in this case, it adds some 
; oomph to an otherwise bland image.
; 
; As a side note, while reading the 'other' (the U.F.) fractal 
; mailing list this morning, where I constantly lurk but almost 
; never speak, I noticed that the question, "Can I quit my job and 
; make a living selling fractals?", has come up once again.
; 
; I suppose that nearly everyone who gets fairly good at producing 
; fractals soon has a dream of quitting their job and becoming 
; rich and famous by selling prints of their images.  They fancy 
; the fractal-hungry world seeing the fractals and going, "Wow!  
; I've got to have a few of those beautiful (thousand-dollar) 
; images!"
; 
; Unfortunately, there are many reasons why this dream will not 
; come true.  To begin, the world is not fractal-hungry, it is 
; mildly curious.  Those who have the big money to pay already 
; know this.  It is possible, if the price is low enough, (ten 
; dollars), to have a pleasant afternoon selling a few images at a 
; local art festival, but even here, those who see the images are 
; more interested in talking about them than buying them.
; 
; As a graphic designer, I work with images every day.  I know the 
; things people want and what they are willing to pay big money 
; for.  And fractals are just not one of them.  If a commercial 
; market for fractals did actually exist, I would have found it by 
; now.
; 
; Fractals should be fun.  They should not lead to the 
; disappointment that results when one sees their dream of earning 
; substantial money shattered.  Those looking for a workable way 
; to earn a living without being tied to a 9-to-5 job would do 
; better stuffing envelopes at home.
; 
; Today's FOTD image will earn no money for me, but I had a bit of 
; fun creating it, and I will feel no disappointment next week 
; when it lies filed on a disk, forgotten and worthless.  Today 
; however, it rates a 7.  And the render time of one minute is an 
; extra blessing.
; 
; For those who don't want to be bothered by parameter files, the 
; GIF image is available on the internet at:

;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Another perfect day Monday here at fractal HQ brought out the 
; best in the cats, who managed to spend several hours in the yard 
; without getting into trouble.  They had such a satisfying time 
; outside in fact that they were actually eager to come indoors 
; when evening put an end to their romp.
; 
; And believe it or not, today promises to be as perfect a day as 
; Monday.  I have no idea what the dynamic duo did to deserve such 
; good winter weather.  As for me, I have a day's work to tackle 
; before I can think of taking it easy at the fractal computer.  
; As always, I'll return in 24 hours with a new fractal and some 
; words of enlightenment.  Until then, take care, and enlighten-
; ment is enlightening only for those who believe the message.
