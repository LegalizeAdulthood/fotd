; FOTD -- January 05, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Having replaced the dead fan in the Fractal computer with a 
; workable fan from an unused machine, I once again have Fractal 
; Central up and running.  As a test of the new unit, I set the 
; faithful 200mhz machine, which I rescued from oblivion, to the 
; task of finding another fractal, a task which it has always 
; accomplished admirably.  After I allowed 2 hours for any 
; potential problems to show up, the machine performed perfectly 
; with its new fan, and coughed up today's image.
; 
; The image was designed to be no more than a test, but when I saw 
; the result, I decided that with its rating of 5, the image was 
; good enough to be christened FOTD for January 5.
; 
; The image is a scene in the Mandeloid that results when 0.3 
; parts of Z^(-8) are subtracted from Z^(-4) before adding 1/C.  
; The midget in the image is located in the outskirts of a larger 
; midget, which in turn is located some distance inland of the 
; main bay of the grossly oversized parent.  The outzoom to the 
; parent is quite an interesting trip.  Change the passes to 1 and 
; the logmap to 0 and have a go at it.
; 
; With a render time of 3 minutes, running the parameter file is 
; almost as convenient as downloading the completed image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; But give Paul and Scott a chance to get their sites updated 
; before going for the image.
; 
; The Fractal Central weather Friday was sunny but breezy and 
; cold.  The high temperature of 38F 3C was a bit too chilly for 
; the cats, who spent the day watching me struggle with the 
; fractal computer, while intermittently asking for food.
; 
; It's now almost midnight, time to shut down the fractal shoppe, 
; call it a night, and settle down to watch one of those 
; gloriously bad old sci-fi movies from the 1950's.  Maybe I'll 
; choose "Them", the movie about the giant ants.  That one is 
; actually a bit above average, and it's much fun to doze off 
; while watching it.  Until tomorrow at around this same time, 
; take care, and keep the sunny side up.
