; FOTD -- January 25, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image reminds me of a fly's head with its bug-eyes 
; staring straight at the viewer.  As a rule, I don't care much 
; for those "Hello Earthling", or in this case, "Hello Human", 
; types of fractals, but today I'll make an exception.
; 
; The object at the center of today's image is a view in the 
; Rectangular direction of a tiny midget far out on the negative 
; stem of the Mandelbrot set.  Due to the intense colors, it rates 
; a 6.  Without the colors, which are created with the <tdis> 
; option, it would rate no higher than a 4.
; 
; Part of the impact of the image is a result of the 22 scale-like 
; arms radiating from the fly's head.  Yes, I realize that in the 
; Mandelbrot set and its Julia sets, the number of features around 
; midgets is always in the 8,16,32... series, but today's image is 
; neither a Mandelbrot nor a Julia image.
; 
; The 32 arms are there, surrounding the midget as always, but 
; when the 4-D object is sliced at today's particular point and 
; orientation, the slice misses some of the arms.  Hints and 
; fragments of the missing arms are visible around the border of 
; the image and beyond.
; 
; Not being in a particularly creative mood, I gave today's 
; picture the most simple name possible.  I named it "The Fly".  
; And it just happens that the original "The Fly" film is one of 
; my favorite old junkers.  (It actually is quite a good film as 
; films of that era go.  The second sequel, "The Curse of the 
; Fly", is the junker.)
; 
; Lack of time is no excuse for failure to view today's image.  
; The parameter file renders in only 53 seconds on my tired old 
; machine.  And the completed image is also available at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Thursday here at Fractal Central began with 
; a downpour at dawn, which tapered to a gentle rain by 11am and 
; ended entirely by 1pm, leaving the area socked in with heavy 
; clouds and soggy grass for the afternoon.  Two bad days in a row 
; left the cats quite irritated, so irritated in fact that later 
; in the afternoon one of them missed the litter pan.  More tuna 
; put them in a better mood, but they still would have preferred a 
; romp in the yard.
; 
; And I would prefer to have the day's work behind me rather than 
; in front of me.  A few hours' labor will cure that problem 
; however.  So until tomorrow, same time same place, take care, 
; and some things come and some things go, but fractals go on 
; forever.
