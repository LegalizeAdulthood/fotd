; FOTD -- January 16, 2002 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the center column of yesterday's image, 
; which was a side view of East Valley, though today's image is 
; viewed from an entirely different angle.  Today's view is in the 
; Mandelbrot direction.
; 
; The East Valley areas of all midgets are filled with elephant-
; like features.  In today's image, the elephants appear as a ring 
; of 16 animals surrounding the midget.  The individual animals 
; are a bit hard to distinguish, since the trunks of the elephants 
; appear to merge with the tails of the ones in front.
; 
; I named the image "Elephant Ring" because of this ring of 
; Pachyderms.
; 
; Today's image is one of the easiest to color that I have yet 
; seen.  Almost any palette works with it.  This ease of coloring 
; justifies the rating of 8.
; 
; The magnitude of today's image lies well beyond the point where 
; arbitrary precision math becomes necessary.  It is therefore a 
; very slow one, requiring over two hours to render on my machine. 
; The long wait can be bypassed by downloading the completed image 
; from Scott's web site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; But before visiting, give Scott a chance to render and post the 
; image.  I will not include Paul Lee's web address until his site 
; once again becomes active.
; 
; With a high temperature of 52F 11C, Tuesday's weather here at 
; Fractal Central was mild enough, but there was too little sun 
; and too much wind to make the fractal cats happy.  After 
; spending only 10 minutes outdoors, they retired to their chosen 
; resting places to sleep the day away.  The fractal cats have 
; happy lives.  It's too bad they don't realize it.
; 
; As for me, my life will be happier when the day's work is out of 
; the way and I can return to fractal land to find a new and 
; greater fractal for tomorrow (if possible).  Until then, take 
; care, and keep striving.
