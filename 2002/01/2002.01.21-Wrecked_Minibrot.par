; FOTD -- January 21, 2001 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image features just another Seahorse Valley midget, this 
; one located deep in a bottomless spiral pit.  Though this type 
; of midget is quite familiar, the rectangular aspect of such 
; midgets is far less familiar.
; 
; The roughly triangular thing at the center of the image is a 
; wrecked minibrot.  I wrecked it by slicing it in the Rectangular 
; direction.  Therefore, the name "Wrecked Minibrot" could also be 
; spelled "Rect. Minibrot".
; 
; Due to the striking color palette, the image rates a 7.  Without 
; the fancy colors, it would rate no more than a 5.
; 
; The undistorted Minibrot can be viewed by zooming into the 
; Mandelbrot set at the C coordinates entered as p4 in today's 
; image.
; 
; The 16-minute render time of the parameter file is a bit 
; excessive, but not too much so.  Regardless, the finished GIF 
; image will be posted shortly to Scott's web site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Hopefully, the FOTD images and discussions will soon be 
; regularly posted again to Paul's web site.
; 
; The fractal weather Sunday here at Fractal central was not bad.  
; The brilliant sun and temperature of 41F 5C were pleasant 
; enough, but the snow still on the ground kept the dynamic cat 
; duo confined to the porch, which I swept clean for their 
; convenience.  Showing no gratitude, the cats grew cranky when 
; they could not go into the yard without getting their feet cold 
; and wet.  I finally eased their crankiness with the standard 
; dollop of tuna.
; 
; Well, it's the Martin Luther King Day holiday here in the USA, 
; and even though the holiday is not taken seriously by some, I 
; take it very seriously, and try to do the minimum amount of work 
; possible.  Looking at the clock, I see that it's now time to get 
; busy on the task of figuring how to do the least amount of work 
; with the least effort possible.  But in 24 hours I'll once again 
; be busy, as I return with another FOTD.  Until then, take care, 
; and thank the powers that fractals exist.
