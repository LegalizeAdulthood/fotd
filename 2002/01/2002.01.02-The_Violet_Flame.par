; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'm suffering a bit of a post-holiday let-down.  And since 
; there's nothing better than a fractal search to treat the post-
; anything blues, I treated myself to a round of fractals and 
; found today's midget.  The fractal did not totally erase the 
; blues, but they're now less obvious.
; 
; It's a humble scene I found, which I can rate no higher than a 
; 3, a picture of a midget in a valley of the Z^(sqrt(2))+C 
; Mandeloid.  I chose this particular fractal to explore because 
; the midgets it holds are often surrounded by features with 2-way 
; symmetry, and like midgets in the classic Mandelbrot set, are 
; therefore relatively easy to find.
; 
; The image might be worth more than the lowly 3 I assigned it, 
; but in my depressed condition, I could rate nothing much higher. 
; The name "The Violet Flame" came to mind when I noticed the 
; violet fringe surrounding the midget.  There is little in the 
; image to suggest an actual flame.
; 
; With its render time of 16 minutes, running the parameter file 
; is one way of seeing today's scene.  A better way is to go on 
; the internet and download the finished GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Once again Tuesday the 32F 0C cold kept the fractal cats 
; confined to quarters, where they forgot their troubles in a long 
; sleep by the radiator.  When they finally stirred, it was past 
; nightfall, and a good meal kept them content.
; 
; The philosophy I accidentally posted to the Fractint list seems 
; to have taken on a life of its own.  If anyone taking part in 
; the off-topic discussion is subscribed to the philofractal list, 
; let's move the discussion there, where we can rant and rave to 
; our hearts' content.  If no one cares enough to have re-
; subscribed to that quirky list, perhaps it's time to forget the 
; philosophy and let the list die an overdue death.
; 
; As for myself, I'm going to forget fractals for a few minutes, 
; and despite my down mood, tackle the other work that needs to 
; be done around here.  Holidays are great, but they sure disrupt 
; the work routine.  Until next time, take care, and fractals 
; inspire, but what do they inspire?
