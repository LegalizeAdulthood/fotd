; FOTD -- March 06, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The FOTD CD preparation is in full swing, the main hold-up being 
; the time required to re-render the old images, most of which are 
; SF5 and SF7, at the SF6 800x600x256 resolution.  I am also 
; locating hundreds of my very early fractal efforts, which were 
; created with several fractal generating programs and need to be 
; converted to GIF format for inclusion on the CD.  These very 
; early images, some from before 1990, are of variable quality, 
; but they do show the route I took on the way to the present 
; stage of my fractal development.
; 
; I am also watching with interest the current thread on the 
; Fractint list about CPU speed, since I plan on soon purchasing a 
; new machine and want to be sure I choose the one that works the 
; best and fastest with Fractint, and not one that can't even 
; display the VESA video modes.
; 
; Today's fractal diversion is a quick trip to the Z^3+C Mandeloid 
; for a quick, (if 18 minutes can be considered quick,) glance at 
; a cubic midget.  I named the image "Somber Center" because the 
; brilliant and lively detail in the outer areas grows ever more 
; dull and somber as the midget is approached.
; 
; The completed GIF image will be available in a few minutes on 
; Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Tuesday here at Fractal Central was sunny 
; but quite cold.  Starting at 11F -12C, the temperature rose to 
; 38F 3C by the afternoon, which was not nearly warm enough for 
; the sensitive ears of the fractal cats, who demanded and got two 
; treats of consolation tuna.
; 
; As for me, I've got a couple customers demanding their jobs, 
; which I had better get started on if I hope to finish by this 
; afternoon.  And of course, there's the work on the FOTD CD 
; always waiting in the wings when I run out of other things to 
; do.  Until next time, take care, and a cube is sometimes better 
; than a square.
