; FOTD -- March 09, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There's a lot of emerald in today's image, and I was first going 
; to give it a name describing something emerald.  But before 
; finding the proper emerald name I decided to name the image 
; after the exponent of Z, which is 2-1/2.  It's an image of a 
; midget in a valley of its parent fractal, which is located 31.8 
; levels up the abstract logarithmic spiral.
; 
; Although the Z^2.5+C Mandeloid comes in many shapes, the shape 
; of today's midget is one of the most frequently seen.  The 
; broken spiral arms are an inescapable feature of images with 
; fractional exponents of Z.  In fact, the BC in the name of the 
; generating formula stands for 'branch cuts', one of the names by 
; which these discontinuities are known.
; 
; After a few moments of thought I found the name "Deuce and a 
; Half".  A few more moments passed before I decided to rate the 
; image at a 5.  The render time of 4 minutes is not too much to 
; spend on a merely average image, but those who would rather 
; spend even less time may find the image posted at Paul's web 
; site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Friday was quite spring-like, which made the fractal 
; cats quite happy.  The temperature of 70F 21C and warm sun 
; brought out the best in them, giving them nothing more to do 
; than lie on the porch and sleep the afternoon away.
; 
; I however have much to do -- a little real work and quite a bit 
; of work on the upcoming FOTD CD.  So until next time, take care 
; and be patient.  The FOTD we know and love will return on a new 
; and improved daily basis when the CD is ready in a few months.
