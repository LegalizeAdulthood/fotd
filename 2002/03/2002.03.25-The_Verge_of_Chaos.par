; FOTD -- March 25, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There are rumors that I am running out of enthusiasm for the 
; FOTD, that the interval between FOTD's will gradually grow 
; longer until that day arrives when the FOTD shall be no more.  
; These unfounded rumors must be laid to rest.
; 
; True, it has been four days since the last FOTD.  This delay 
; has been because of an unexpected work load, the preparation of 
; the FOTD CD, and a sudden burst of activity on the philofractal 
; list, which despite my best intentions, I simply cannot tear 
; myself from.  The delay does not indicate an impending boredom 
; on my part with fractals or the FOTD.  Indeed, when the CD is 
; ready, the FOTD will return to its daily schedule.
; 
; Today's image is a return to the area of the M-set where chaos 
; begins.  The elements surrounding the midget have already 
; largely disintegrated into chaos, leaving only, zig-zag arms and 
; a few flat areas.  The next image, which is due on the 27th, 
; will be one fully immersed in chaos.
; 
; I could rate today's image, which I named "The Verge of Chaos", 
; no higher than a 4.  But do not despair, far better things are 
; to come.  The render time of 4 minutes can be escaped by 
; downloading the finished image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Sunday was chilly, but sunny and pleasant, with a 
; cat-pleasing temperature of 59F 15C.  And I've got so much to do 
; that if I don't get started, I'll never finish.  Until next 
; time, take care, and look for a photograph of myself in the near 
; future.  Until the photo appears, go with your mental image.
