; FOTD -- March 31, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's Easter Sunday here at Fractal Central and all is well.  
; True, a light rain has started to fall and the cats are unhappy, 
; but other than that, all is indeed well.
; 
; Well, all is not totally well, especially for those who can 
; never be satisfied -- those who complain that the recently 
; posted photograph of myself is five years old.  Yes, it is five 
; years old, and Fractal Central has moved since then, but other 
; than a little more grey here and there on me, and a few changes 
; in the surroundings, both I and Fractal Central look exactly the 
; same as we did when the FOTD began.
; 
; But do not despair.  All hope of being updated is not lost.  
; Up-to-date photos of myself, the fractal cats and the new 
; Fractal Central will be coming in the not-too-distant future.  
; Until that glorious day arrives, be satisfied with what you've 
; got.
; 
; Now on to the ever-exciting world of fractals.  Every once in a 
; while a fractal comes along that is totally unexpected.  Today's 
; image is one of those totally unexpected fractals.  It was 
; generated when the basic equal-iteration-bands method was 
; applied to the iterated formula 10Z^(0.1)-Z+C, yet it looks more 
; like it was created by some wild invention with a coloring 
; section many lines long.
; 
; I named the image "Totally Unexpected" because that's what it 
; is.  I rated it a 7 because that's what I feel it is worth.  The 
; render time of the attached parameter file is in the vicinity of 
; 1/2 hour, a long enough wait to make a download of the completed 
; image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; worth the little effort.
; 
; The fractal weather Saturday was hazy and warm.  The temperature 
; of 68F 20C brought out the best in the cats.  Too bad it's 
; raining today.  Rain brings out the worst in them.
; 
; Right now, I'm setting myself up for a huge Easter feast.  If I 
; survive the feast, I'll return on April 3 with the next awe-
; inspiring image.  Until then, take care, and think about what 
; might really lie behind Easter.
