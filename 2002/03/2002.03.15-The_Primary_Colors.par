; FOTD -- March 15, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Sometime around the 6th grade I learned about the seven colors 
; of the rainbow.  Those colors were red, orange, yellow, green, 
; blue, indigo, and violet.  Being a scientifically minded young 
; fellow, I found this quite interesting, and eagerly waited for 
; the next rainbow to appear.
; 
; Some time later, a rainbow did appear.  But where were those 
; seven colors?  I saw lots of red, almost no orange or yellow, 
; some green, but not a trace of the blue, indigo or violet.  And 
; what of colors such as brown, pink, purple, gold, etc.?  Where 
; did those colors fit into the rainbow?  I soon discovered that 
; brown, pink, purple, and gold are not spectral colors, though 
; the absence of yellow and blue in the natural bow remained a 
; puzzle.
; 
; I think it was the next year that I learned about infra-red and 
; ultra-violet light.  Were those 'colors' actually there in the 
; sky, lurking invisibly on both sides of the visible bow?  It was 
; not until many years later, when I photographed rainbows in 
; infra-red and ultra-violet light, that I discovered the answer.  
; Yes, I found that infra-red and ultra-violet rainbows do indeed 
; exist.  The infra-red bow is quite sharp, while the ultra-violet 
; bow is diffuse and far less obvious.
; 
; Since today's image is composed of strong primary colors, I 
; named it "The Primary Colors".  Since it neither pleases nor 
; disappoints me, I have rated it an average 5.  The render time 
; of 28 minutes is a bit slow for an average image.  I therefore 
; recommend downloading the GIF file of the image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:

;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Thursday here at Fractal Central was quite pleasant, 
; with lots of sun and a temperature of 66F 19C.  These conditions 
; made for very happy cats, who simply oozed joy as they romped in 
; the yard, trying to deceive themselves that they were still able 
; to catch one of the squirrels that intermittently teased them.
; 
; As for me, I'm about at the 30 percent stage in the preparation 
; of the soon-to-appear FOTD-CD.  This means that I have about 
; twice as much yet to do as I have already done.  The progress is 
; about as expected.  My present schedule of all day on the CD and 
; 1/2 day once every 3 days on the ongoing FOTD is keeping things 
; pretty much on schedule.  Look for the next FOTD on Monday, the 
; 18th of March.  Until then take care, and don't get fractally 
; congested.
