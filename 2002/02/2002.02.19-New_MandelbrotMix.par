; FOTD -- February 19, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Three days have passed since the FOTD last appeared.  In that 
; time, I have been working on the upcoming FOTD CD, which is now 
; about 18 percent complete.  (The inevitable unexpected problems 
; have not yet appeared, so the disk might actually be closer to 
; 10 percent complete.)
; 
; In addition to the CD, I have been working on a MandelbrotMix3 
; formula, which instead of mixing 2 powers of Z, as the M-Mix4 
; formula does, mixes 4 powers of Z.  As of this time, I have done 
; very little work with this new formula, but I have done enough 
; to realize that it has much potential.
; 
; I have named today's image "New MandelbrotMix" because it marks 
; the first appearance of the new formula, unfinished as the 
; formula is, and it also introduces the next class of fractals, 
; which, mixing 4 powers of Z instead of 2, will presumably have 
; more variety.
; 
; These new fractals will often have several critical starting 
; points.  At this time however, the different critical points 
; must be calculated and entered manually.  I have not yet figured 
; how to get the formula to automatically calculate the multiple 
; critical starting points and initialize Z to these values.
; 
; Today's image rates an average 5, making it a bit slow when 
; rendered from the parameter file.  The better way of viewing the 
; image is to download it from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Monday was fair enough for the cats to spend 
; several hours on the porch watching the robins feast on the 
; holly berries.  The sun peeked above the holly trees just enough 
; to give them a few spots of midday warmth to chase.  The 
; temperature of 46F 8C was a bit chilly however, especially when 
; the sun dipped behind the trees again, sending the dynamic duo 
; scurrying for their warm beds indoors.
; 
; I see that the morning is growing short, and I've got lots to do 
; before the day ends.  Until next time, take care, and fractal 
; dreams.
