; FOTD -- February 11, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Progress continues on the FOTD CD, which is cutting into my 
; current fractal time, but I am still managing several FOTD's per 
; week.
; 
; Today's perturbed fractal, with its ghostly outline of a 
; Mandelbrot bud in the background and a spectacular spiral in the 
; foreground, is a return to the type of images I was doing 10 
; years ago.  Well, it's not exactly like what I was doing ten 
; years ago, since today's image would not have been possible back 
; then.  The maxiter of today's image is 300,000, while 10 years 
; ago, Fractint's maximum maxiter was 32,767.
; 
; I have never really understood what causes these ghostly high-
; iteration remnants of the unperturbed M-set to remain in the 
; background of the perturbed sets.  I have read explanations 
; explaining that the foreground in images like today's is complex 
; material, while the background is real material, but this 
; doesn't really make sense.  My own guess is that regardless of 
; where the iterated points start their travels, if they don't 
; escape first, they will eventually settle into the same orbits 
; as the points that start at 0,0.
; 
; The name of today's image -- Mandelbrot-03 -- is more of a 
; catalog number than a true name.  The rating of 5 is perfectly 
; average.  The render time is in the range of 5 minutes, which is 
; bearable.  And the pre-rendered GIF image can be downloaded from 
; either of the following two web sites:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Sunday was wet and chilly -- not the most 
; enjoyable kind of weather for fractal cats.  But the intrepid 
; duo faced the adversity bravely, and came through the day with 
; only minor complaints.
; 
; As for myself, it's Monday morning and I've got a load of work 
; waiting to be done, not to mention the work on that FOTD CD, 
; which is in progress.  Until the next FOTD arrives in a couple 
; days, take care, and what happened to the public's fascination 
; with fractals.
