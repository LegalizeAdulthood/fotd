; FOTD -- February 16, 2002 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yes, I realize that three days have passed since the last FOTD.  
; The FOTD CD is coming on schedule, (8 months are ready, 63 
; months remain to be done, and the colors of many of the old 
; images need to be brightened.), but the CD is taking so much of 
; my spare time that I have little time remaining for new FOTD's.  
; The FOTD is not in danger of going the way of the dodo however, 
; and when the CD is ready, the new FOTD's will once again appear 
; on a daily basis.  After all, what would the philofractal list 
; be without a new FOTD every day?  It certainly is not a UF or 
; FractalTalk list.
; 
; Today's formula, NewtonTest27, is an old one that has lain idle 
; for several years.  It represents an early effort on my part to 
; do something unusual with Newton's fractals.  Nothing much ever 
; came of the effort, for shortly after writing today's formula, I 
; got involved in the four-dimensional Julibrot figure and midgets 
; in 2-part formulae, and soon forgot my Newton's efforts.
; 
; But as today's 8-rated FOTD shows, some of these old Newton's 
; formulae can create very interesting images.  Studying today's 
; image, I first noticed the prominent spiral in the upper left, 
; then my eye was caught by the lantern-like figures rising from 
; the lower right corner and merging into the spiral.  I named the 
; picture "Lantern Spiral".
; 
; With a rating of 8, the 3-minute render time of the parameter 
; file is quite reasonable.  But it is not absolutely reasonable.  
; Those who demand the ultimate in reason will find the image 
; posted in all its illumined glory to Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and to Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Friday here at Fractal Central was fair 
; enough.  The comfort of hazy sun and a temperature of 52F 11C 
; was tempered by a chilly wind that kept the fractal cats 
; confined to the porch.  From the porch, they kept a watchful eye 
; on a flock of robins that descended at midday to feast on the 
; holly berries.  Tippy chattered wishfully for a robin to stray 
; within pouncing range, but the wise birds never came within 
; several meters of his eagerly waiting claws.
; 
; As for myself, it's a Saturday morning and I've got 61 months of 
; FOTD's yet to prepare for transfer to CD.  So until the next 
; FOTD appears in a couple days, take care, and keep the faith.
