; FOTD -- February 22, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The CD is progressing on schedule, with (so far) only minor 
; problems.  If things continue this way, the disk will be ready 
; by this Summer, Winter, wet season, or dry season, depending on 
; the climate where this letter is being read
; 
; I named today's image 2-of-4, not because it reminds me of a 
; Star-Trek episode, but because it is the second FOTD created 
; with my new experimental formula, which mixes four powers of Z.  
; The formula has been changed since I used it for the most recent 
; FOTD, but the parameter files that were written using the first 
; version of the formula will also work with the present version, 
; (if the function is set to <ident>), so I did not change the 
; formula name.
; 
; Today's image rates only a 4.  But this does not make the 
; formula a failure.  Rather, it is a sign that I have not yet 
; become familiar with the things that might be possible when four 
; powers of Z, some negative, some positive, are combined in a 
; single iteration.
; 
; To be honest, today's image resembles many images that I have 
; passed over while using the M-Mix4 formula.  I suspect that 
; adding ever more powers of Z in a single iteration will soon 
; result in diminishing returns, much as raising the exponent does 
; in a formula such as Z^100+C.  But I'll give my new formula a 
; fair trial before consigning it to the graveyard of forgotten 
; formulas.  (Formulae for the over-educated.)
; 
; The six-minute render time is bearable.  Downloading the 
; completed image is even more bearable.  And the image can be 
; downloaded from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Thursday was ideal for man and cats alike -- 
; warm sun, mild breezes, and a spring-like temperature of 66F 
; 19C.  Now that the midday sun has cleared the holly trees, the 
; porch was ideal for Thomas and Tippy, who passed the afternoon 
; there, sunning themselves and watching the robins.
; 
; As for me, it's back to work and back to the FOTD CD, which is 
; now 14 percent completed.  Until next FOTD, take care, and 
; things can only get better.
