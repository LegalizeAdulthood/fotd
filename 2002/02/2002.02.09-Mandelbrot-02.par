; FOTD -- February 09, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The job of preparing the FOTD CD grows ever more formidable.  
; The current difficulties are caused by the total lack of 
; uniformity of the early FOTD's.  Due to bad line breaks, etc., 
; many of the parameter files will no longer run, and need to be 
; re-created from the original GIF images.  Also, the size of the 
; saved images is anything I was in the mood for at the time.  The 
; off-size images need to be re-rendered in the SF6 (800x600x256) 
; format, which will be the standard size of the images on the CD.
; 
; Luckily, when I realized that the FOTD would become a major 
; project, I settled into a uniform style, but I still have a year 
; or so of haphazard format to struggle through before I reach the 
; easy part of the job.  I'll keep everyone updated on the FOTD CD 
; progress.
; 
; Today we have another simple scene -- a midget deep in a spiral 
; in the north branch of Scepter Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  
; Due to the cursory coloring, the image rates an average 5.  A 
; better job of coloring would raise the rating to a 7.
; 
; The render time of 6 minutes is a bit much to ask for a merely 
; average image.  The more efficient way to view the scene is to 
; let Paul and Scott render the image and pick it up from one of 
; their web sites.
; 
; Paul's site is at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and Scott's is at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Friday pleased the cats, who spent several 
; hours on the porch, waiting for the sun to clear the holly trees 
; and bathe them in solar radiance.  Unfortunately, it will be a 
; couple weeks before the sun angle grows high enough to rise 
; above the trees and reach the porch.  The temperature of 56F 13C 
; made up for the lack of sun however.
; 
; It's now time to get back on a bit of regular work, and when 
; that is finished, to tackle the FOTD CD.  Until next time, which 
; will come in 2 or 3 days, take care, and see you then.
