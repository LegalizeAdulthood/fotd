; FOTD -- February 28, 2002 (Rating 2)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have seen a rumor on the Fractint list recently that the 
; upcoming FOTD CD will be a musical one.  I would like to put 
; this rumor to rest.  There will be no music on the CD, neither 
; fractal music nor otherwise.  Fractals make great visual images. 
; They can even be used to select words from a dictionary and 
; place them in an arrangement that will simulate bad poetry.  But 
; fractals do not make music that I have the patience to sit, 
; concentrate on, listen to for hours, and be inspired by.  When 
; turned into sound, fractals do make very interesting background 
; noise however, though I do not consider this cacophony to be 
; music.
; 
; Today's lowly 2-rated fractal is little better than 'fractal 
; music', and it represents the end of my adventures with the 
; experimental MandelbrotMix3 formula.  The experiment has been a 
; failure.  The image shows why.  This fractal is typical of those 
; created by the formula.  The image tries too hard.  It has so 
; much of everything that it ends up having a lot of nothing.  It 
; is so busy with competing themes that it has no single theme to 
; serve as a center of attention.  In frustration, I named the 
; image "A Boring Lesson".
; 
; In addition, the formula is exasperatingly slow, and requires 
; the user to calculate a critical starting point manually.  The 
; outcome of all this is that the formula has been consigned to 
; the trash bin of forgotten formulae.  I have satisfied myself 
; that, just as the Z^2 Mandeloid creates the richest fractal, so 
; does mixing only 2 powers of Z create the richest mixed images.
; 
; I leave it to the reader to decide whether a 2-rated image is 
; worth the 50 minutes required to render it from the parameter 
; file.  Those who decide that the image is not worth nearly an 
; hour of computer time may download the finished image from one 
; of the following two web sites:

; 
; The fractal weather Wednesday here at Fractal Central was sunny 
; but blustery and cold.  In response, the mood of the fractal 
; cats was also blustery.  They passed much of the day on their 
; shelf by the window, watching a flock of blackbirds scrounging 
; for morsels in the yard and intermittently complaining about the 
; cold.
; 
; It's not time to finish the modicum of real work so that I can 
; return to the preparation of the FOTD CD.  Until a few days from 
; now, take care and see you soon.
