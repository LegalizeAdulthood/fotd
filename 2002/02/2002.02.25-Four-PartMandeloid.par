; 
; FOTD -- February 25, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Progress continues on the upcoming FOTD CD, which will contain 
; fractals and discussions of times past.  But even as the disk 
; progresses, the ongoing FOTD continues to languish, now 
; appearing only every third day.
; 
; As I struggle through the old e-mail files, I wonder how many 
; CD's I will sell.  Yes, I will need to sell the disks -- it 
; takes time to copy a disk and blank disks cost money.  Having a 
; disk mass-produced is also costly, but I wonder how many I will 
; actually sell.  Being an optimist, I expect to sell not 
; hundreds, not thousands, not tens of thousands, but tens -- 
; if I am lucky.
; 
; The questionable success of the CD project is not the only 
; concern.  While filtering through the masses of discarded 
; e-mail, I cannot avoid re-reading the old FOTD discussions.  And 
; as I re-read them and compare them with the recent discussions, 
; I notice a fire in the old ones that is missing in the recent 
; discussions.
; 
; In those old discussions, I often discussed things such as 
; the curiosities of the fourth dimension.  I also frequently 
; expressed my metaphysical beliefs, and as expected, I was 
; soundly disagreed with by those who place their full faith in 
; the methods of physical science.  The debates often grew quite 
; lively, though never developed into a full-blown flame war.
; 
; Then, I eventually grew bored with repeating the 4-D curiosities 
; and engaging in debates that have no solution, and the FOTD 
; settled into its current routine.  The daily weather and antics 
; of the cats replaced the polytopes and spirit worlds, even as 
; the fractals settled into an endless series of varied but still 
; similar quadratic midgets.  And this is where the FOTD currently 
; stands.
; 
; Perhaps I need to return to the ways of the past.
; 
; Today's image, another midget, continues the lethargic trend.  
; It is a scene in the fractal created by the formula:
; 
;           -0.25(Z^5)+0.5(Z^4)+(Z^3)-2(Z^2)+C
; 
; This particular expression has one of its critical points at 
; zero, so no non-zero value needed to be entered as the p5 
; parameter.
; 
; I named the image "Four-Part Mandeloid" as a cataloguing 
; description.  Consider the name the same as you would a name 
; like "Concerto in b-flat".
; 
; The image is not quite up to the current average, so I could 
; rate it at only a 4.  The render time of almost 40 minutes is a 
; bit much for such a below-average image.  I strongly recommend 
; downloading the completed GIF image file from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; With bright sun, light winds, and a temperature of 52F 11C, the 
; fractal weather Sunday was near perfect for the dynamic duo of 
; fractal cats, who spent several hours roaming the yard, watching 
; for intruding cats.  Thomas growled from the porch as the shadow 
; of an unwanted tomcat passed through the brush behind the yard.
; 
; It was near perfect for me also.  I spent much of the day 
; working on the CD, which is near 15-percent finished, and if all 
; goes well, (which is unlikely), will be ready by sometime this 
; summer.  Until next FOTD, take care, and take a fractal after 
; every meal.
