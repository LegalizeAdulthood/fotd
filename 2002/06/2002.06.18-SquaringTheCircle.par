; FOTD -- June 18, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I recently got hooked by one of those science book club offers.  
; This club gives a joining gift of five popular science books at 
; a bargain price in return for the obligation to purchase at 
; least one not-so-popular science book at full price within a 
; year.
; 
; The books I received are mostly about the effort to apply 
; Quantum Mechanics to the universe at large and find a Theory of 
; Everything.  (Via something like those trendy super-strings, I 
; assume.)  (I also noticed a recent letter from Osher Doctorow on 
; the Fractint list about the topic.)
; 
; Finding a T.O.E. is fine, but is the T.O.E. the books tell of 
; really about *everything*?  So far, I have had time only to skim 
; the books, but in none of the indexes do I find an entry for 
; mind or consciousness.  It is as though the mind that is doing 
; the searching does not exist, or if it does, is not included in 
; the set of everything.
; 
; Maybe self-awareness is simply too spooky for any respectable 
; scientist to take a serious interest in.  Maybe it is so 
; mysterious that serious scientists would never tackle the 
; problem for fear of being labelled soft on mysticism.
; 
; I also find myself concerned that the theory of everything, when 
; and if it comes and whether or not it includes the mind, will be 
; in the form of mathematics so abstruse that only the initiated 
; will be able to comprehend it.  I do not want to settle for a 
; watered-down version in a popularized (simplified) book, which 
; will demand faith in the words I read.
; 
; I want a theory that I can think about, understand, and connect 
; to the 'real' world.  I want to be able to say, 'yes, that 
; explains everything', and observe the proof.  (I realize that 
; this will not happen.)  A theory, the proof of which can be 
; comprehended only by the high priests of science, would be of no 
; satisfaction at all.  In fact, IMO, it would border on 
; mysticism.  But then, considering how little of the world of 
; science the common man can actually observe, science has been 
; bordering on mysticism for the past 100 years.
; 
; I'll have many more thoughts on this topic as I work my way 
; through the five books.
; 
; And by the way, there is a fractal for today -- another midget.  
; This one is found in a prominent valley of the fractal that 
; results when Z^(-1.54) is added to Z^(-15.4).  I named today's 
; picture "Squaring the Circle", and impossibility we learn in 
; high school, and rated it a not-too-bad 6.  The render time of 6 
; minutes is not bad either.  For convenience, the completed GIF 
; image is available for download on the W.W.Web at Paul's site:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at Scott's site:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Monday's weather here at Fractal Central was near perfect, 
; making for contented cats and a pleased fractalist.  The 
; temperature of 82F 28C was made even more comfortable by the dry 
; atmosphere, and best of all, at least 2 more similar days are 
; forecast.  The cats will be ecstatic.
; 
; With a day's work before me, I'm not quite ecstatic, but ecstasy 
; is within my grasp if only I play my cards right.  While 
; deciding which card to lead, I'll get a little real work 
; finished.  Until next time, which will arrive in about 72 hours, 
; take care, and when the theory of everything appears, be sure it 
; really explains everything, including why we need a theory of 
; everything.
