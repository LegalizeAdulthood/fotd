; FOTD -- June 27, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I enjoy human foolishness and today we have a lot of it.  The 
; pledge of allegiance to the flag of the U.S.A. has been declared 
; unconstitutional because it mentions God.  I suppose the 
; Declaration of Independence and Constitution are also 
; unconstitutional because they also mention God.  And our money 
; is also unconstitutional because 'In God We Trust' is written on 
; it.
; 
; I wonder why Atheists are so intense in their disbelief.  I 
; happen to believe in some-something that in some way fits the 
; description of a God.  But I do not become offended when 
; Atheists tell me that I am mistaken, or deluded, or clinging to 
; a crying-towel etc.  I simply enjoy the debate, satisfied that I 
; am right and they are wrong, while having fun seeing their 
; futile arguments.  Why then do Atheists so often become offended 
; when believers tell them and futilely try to convince them that 
; they are mistaken in their disbelief?
; 
; Actually, as I see it, Atheism is not so much a disbelief in a 
; god as it is a continued belief in and a defense of the 
; philosophy of positivism, a world-view which, IMO, lost 
; credibility about 100 years ago, and except among Atheists has 
; been declining ever since.  As to what world-view will prevail 
; to replace it, I have no idea.  But one thing is certain -- a 
; new world-view will need to extend beyond the traditional five 
; senses.  Most of the universe is invisible to our senses even 
; aided by the best instruments.
; 
; And we do have a fractal for today.  For a change, there is no 
; quadratic midget at the center.  In fact, today's image consists 
; of the entire fractal created by the formula 
; -0.2(Z^(-1.25)-0.2(Z^(-0.8)+(1/C).
; 
; While studying the image, I had the impression of a butterfly 
; emerging from its cocoon.  I named the image "Birth".  I rated 
; it at a run-of-the-mill 6.
; 
; The 11-minute render time can be avoided by downloading the 
; completed GIF file from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Wednesday here at Fractal Central was hot.  
; In fact, it was the hottest day of the young summer.  The 
; temperature of 99F 37C and high humidity kept the cats confined 
; to the shade of the porch and the fractalist confined to the 
; coolness of the air-conditioning.  Late in the afternoon a 
; shower threatened, but died out before reaching Fractal Central.
; 
; Today promises to be a repeat of yesterday, and the cats are 
; already in their lazy mode.  As for me, I've got work to do.  As 
; long as the air cooler keeps working, I'll be fine.  Until next 
; time on the 30th, take care, and see you then.
