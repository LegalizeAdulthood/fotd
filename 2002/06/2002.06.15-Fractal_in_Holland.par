; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'm trying to remember the point at which fractals became art.  
; When I discovered them almost 20 years ago, fractals were 
; mathematical abstractions made visible, if not tangible, through 
; the miracle of the modern computer.  They were not considered 
; art.  But by 1996 they had become art.  Now, we're involved in 
; futile debates about whether fractals based on spirals make good 
; or bad fractal art.
; 
; I am still undecided whether fractals should be considered art 
; at all.  I am also undecided whether the present-day images 
; should be considered fractals or computer art.  Whatever they 
; are, the images certainly are great things to chat about.  But a 
; work of art is a recording of human emotion, rendered in such a 
; way that those of similar psychological make-up, by experiencing 
; the work of art, can feel some measure of the emotions the 
; artist felt while creating the art.
; 
; When I sit at my machine to create (or find) fractals, it is a 
; means of relaxing after days too often filled with frustration.  
; I sometimes put little if any emotion into the images, 
; preferring instead to sit and watch half interested as the 
; numbers do what they will.  (I expend a bit more creative energy 
; when something unexpected appears.)  But if a work has so little 
; emotion put into it at the time of its creation, how can it be 
; considered art?
; 
; In contrast, I find the greatest emotional satisfaction while 
; experiencing the supposedly insentient things of nature, such as 
; the universe, with its stars and galaxies, and the atmosphere 
; with its alternating sun and storms.  These things are not 
; created to be art; they simply just happen.  Where then does the 
; emotion and artistic satisfaction that I feel when experiencing 
; nature, originate?
; 
; It originates within myself.  Art exists in the eye of the 
; beholder.  And perhaps the images that I put so little into can 
; create something in others just as nature creates enjoyment in 
; me.
; 
; I have many more thoughts tumbling around, but after rambling 
; for nearly 1/2 hour, I see that we have a fractal image to 
; discuss.  I named today's picture "Fractal in Holland" when I 
; noticed the windmill-blade shape of the elements around the 
; ubiquitous midget (not a spiral) at the center.  I rated it at a 
; 7 because it's kind of a nice picture.
; 
; The formula behind the image is Z^(-0.75)+4Z^(-7.5)+(1/C).  The 
; (1/C) turns the originally inside-out parent fractal inside out 
; again, making it into a normal fractal with a bay at its center. 
; Such doubly inside-out fractals are very rich hunting grounds.
; 
; The 15-minute render time of the parameter file makes a download 
; of the completed GIF image the best choice.  The download may be 
; found at Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather here at Fractal Central was rainy both 
; Thursday and Friday, with a cool temperature in the 60's.  After 
; being stuck indoors for two days, the fractal cats became 
; restless and testy, but this morning is dry if not sunny, and 
; the cats should soon be venturing into the yard for fun and 
; games.
; 
; As for me, I'm going to venture into the continuing preparation 
; of the FOTD-CD, which will include pictures of the fractal cats. 
; Until next time, which will arrive on June 18, take care, and be 
; artistic.
