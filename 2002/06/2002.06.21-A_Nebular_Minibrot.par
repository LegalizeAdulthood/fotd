; FOTD -- June 21, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As I write these words, it is 9:24am EDT, the moment of the 
; summer solstice in the northern hemisphere.  The sun is now as 
; far north as it ever gets.  Actually, the sun is not located any 
; farther north that it always is, for there is no north and south 
; in space.  What has happened is that the earth has reached the 
; point in its orbit where the north end of its axis is tilted 
; directly toward the sun, which makes today the longest day of 
; the year.  Today is not however the day with the latest sunset.  
; Because the sun is now falling farther behind clock time each 
; day, the day of latest sunset arrives in about one week.
; 
; In the southern hemisphere, where everyone hangs from the 
; earth's surface by their feet and Christmas comes in the summer, 
; all this is reversed!
; 
; Today's fractal is not upside down, but it *has* been rotated to 
; the 'normal' position, with the negative stem actually pointing 
; left, the way all proper stems should point.  The image is the 
; latest in the apparently unending series of Minibrots, and as 
; such, features an object sometimes known as an atom, but better 
; known as a Mandelbrot Midget.  The formula that created not only 
; today's scene but an entire fractal universe, mixes portions of 
; Z^(-1.16) and Z^(-12.5) then adds 1/C instead of just plain C.
; 
; I named the image "A Nebular Minibrot".  The name is justified 
; because the image does have a galactic feeling to it, complete 
; with stars and greenish glowing clouds of gas.  I rated the 
; image at a 6, which is above average but not outstanding.  The 
; rendering time, for those who choose to run the parameter file, 
; is a nominal 5-1/2 minutes on my lazy P200 machine.  And as 
; always, the completed image will soon be available on the two 
; FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Thursday here at Fractal Central was 
; pleasing to man and cats alike, though the cats had more time to 
; enjoy the perfection.  Brilliant sun, crystal blue skies, puffy 
; white clouds, gentle winds, and a temperature of 83F 28C made 
; everyone happy.
; 
; As is usually the case however, I have a bit of work to 
; accomplish before I can enjoy today, which promises to be a 
; repeat of Thursday.  Until next FOTD, which will arrive on the 
; 24th, take care, and I'm not as dumb as I appear and not as 
; smart as I pretend.
