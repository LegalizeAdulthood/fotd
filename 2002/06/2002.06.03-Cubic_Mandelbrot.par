; FOTD -- June 03, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things are moving on schedule here at fractal headquarters, 
; which means that the CD is entering the late mid-stage, the 
; ongoing fractals are continuing to appear, the cats are 
; sleeping, but I have yet to receive the 24-million dollars I 
; was promised by that man who sent me the e-mail.  :-)
; 
; Today we take a trip to the cubic Mandelbrot set to see a 
; cubic midget.  The cubic set is basically an extension of the 
; classic quadratic set M-set, with corresponding features in 
; corresponding areas.  The main difference is that there are 2 
; lobes in the buds, and instead of the 2,4,8... arrangement of 
; elements around the midgets, the arrangement is 3,9,27...  It 
; also becomes meaningless in the cubic set to orient midgets in 
; the 'normal' manner, as I do with quadratic midgets, since cubic 
; midgets have 4-way symmetry.
; 
; I have given today's midget a diagonal orientation, which is 
; both dynamic and somewhat artistic.  As is the case with most 
; of the FOTD's, the coloring is done with the standard equal-
; iteration-band method, with the inside set to black.
; 
; Feeling that the image has at least a modicum of worth, I rated 
; it at a 6.  The name "Cubic Mandelbrot" is a description of the 
; image, with no pretense at cleverness.  The 11-minute render 
; time makes running the parameter file a drag.  The wiser choice 
; is to let Paul and Scott do the dragging, and download the 
; completed image from their web sites.  Paul's site can be found 
; at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Scott's is at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Sunday here at Fractal Central was near 
; perfect, with total sunshine and reasonably happy cats.  The 
; slightly too-warm temperature of 88F 31C was offset by low 
; humidity and a fresh breeze.  The cats would rather have had no 
; wind, because wind conceals the presence of intruders.  But they 
; took the breezes in stride and explored the yard peacefully.
; 
; Being faced with a day of work, I must now end this latest 
; chapter in the unending series of FOTD's, but I'll return on 
; schedule on the next day evenly divisible by 3 -- June 6.  Until 
; then, take care, and search for the meaning in fractals.
