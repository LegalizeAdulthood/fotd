; FOTD -- June 09, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As I have stated several times in the past, I do not do fractal 
; transformations or layers.  The reason is not that I feel 
; something is wrong with doing these things, but that I enjoy 
; discovering the basic fractal shapes rather than doing artistic 
; things with my discoveries.
; 
; My fractals are indeed discoveries rather than works of art.  On 
; rare occasions however, my artistic impulse has gotten the 
; better of me, and I have dabbled in fractal transformations.  
; Today's simple 3-D transformation of a type=plasma image is a 
; result of some Fractint dabbling I did about 9 years ago.
; 
; The image, which I found while gathering old images for the 
; upcoming FOTD CD, is basically 9 years old.  I did nothing but a 
; slight adjustment of the colors to produce today's FOTD image.  
; As is the case with so many of my old images, many of which were 
; created by programs other than Fractint, today's image has no 
; saved parameters that can be used to reconstruct the image, 
; making it necessary to download the image itself from either 
; Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; I named the image "Ice-World".  The reason is obvious.  It takes 
; no imagination to see a jagged icy scene on perhaps the water 
; ice planet Europa, a moon of Jupiter.  Since the image is a 
; transformation, and I'm not supposed to do transformations, I 
; could rate it no higher than a 4, the highest rating that is 
; still below average.
; 
; The fractal weather Saturday here at Fractal Central was close 
; to perfect.  The blue skies, sharp shafts of sunlight through 
; the trees, light winds, low humidity, and a temperature of 77F 
; 25C could hardly be exceeded.  The fractal cats, who enjoy 
; perfection, were nearly perfectly happy in the yard all day, 
; even forgetting for a while that they were hungry.  When the sun 
; sank low in the west, and the chill of evening set in, they 
; finally thought of food, and cried to be fed.
; 
; Since it looks like another near perfect day coming up today, 
; I'm going to try to join the cats and be as close to perfectly 
; happy as possible.  To keep my mind occupied, I'll start reading 
; Hawking's newest book, "The Universe in a Nutshell", which I 
; picked up last week.  Of course, I'll probably never reach the 
; ideal of absolute perfection in happiness, but I'll enjoy myself 
; trying to come as close as possible.  Until next time and next 
; FOTD, which will appear on June 12, take care, and don't lose 
; your cool when you see the ice.  Finally, do not despair.  The 
; FOTD will return to its daily schedule in only a few months.
