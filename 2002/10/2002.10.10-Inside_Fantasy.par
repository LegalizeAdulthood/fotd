; FOTD -- October 10, 2002 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Do human beings have spirits?  The religious say yes, scientists 
; say they have found no evidence, skeptics say probably not, 
; Atheists say no.  I say it depends on the definition of the word 
; 'spirit'.  But one thing certain is that some fractals, (those 
; with negative powers of Z), do have spirits, and those spirits 
; remain behind when the original fractal evaporates.
; 
; As the mention of spirits and the outrageous value of imag(p3) 
; should have made apparent, today's FOTD is another of my 
; 'evaporated' fractals.  (To see the unevaporated version, change 
; imag(p3) to 0.)  There are no escaping points at all in the 
; image, which consists entirely of trapped inside points made 
; visible by the inside fill of bof61.
; 
; I used an inside fill of bof61 in today's image because that 
; fill works best with this particular image.  I have found no way 
; to predict which inside fill will work best with particular 
; evaporated fractals.  The best fill must be found by trial and 
; error.
; 
; The parent fractal consists of a Mandeloid shaped like a bloated 
; queen termite, with an immense area of chaos to its east.  This 
; chaotic area contains regions where the chaos becomes lace-like 
; and converges in nodes.  Today's scene lies near one of the most 
; prominent nodes.  The actual node of course has long since evap-
; orated from the world of fractal reality.
; 
; Since the image is something relatively unique, I rated it at an 
; 8, which is a great improvement over yesterday's miserable 4.  I 
; named it "Inside Fantasy" as a description.  Considering the 
; much-above-average worth of the finished product, the render 
; time of 6 minutes is reasonable.  And as always, the finished 
; GIF image is available for near-instant download on Paul's web 
; site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and on Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The Wednesday weather here at Fractal Central was of the dull, 
; dreary variety.  The lack of sun, temperature of 61F 16C, 
; occasional spits of rain, and the wrong flavor cat food left the 
; fractal cats very testy.  In the evening, Tippy defiantly en-
; sconced himself in my favorite chair, and dared me to try to 
; dislodge him.  Tippy won the battle.
; 
; My next battle will be won when I finish the work now before me. 
; But to finish I must first start, so until tomorrow, when an 
; even better fractal might appear, take care, and prepare for 
; the war against obese fractals.
