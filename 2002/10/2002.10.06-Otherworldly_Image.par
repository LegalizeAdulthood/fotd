; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For some reason, I named today's fractal "Otherworldly Image".  
; I forget the reason, but fractals are truly not of this world.  
; How could they be when even the simple fractals I work with 
; exist in four dimensions, and this 'real' world of ours is 
; endowed with only three spatial dimensions?  So the name is 
; justified after all.
; 
; The formula that created today's fractal adds together 8 parts 
; of Z^(-1.3), 2 parts of Z^(-8.3), and one part of (1/C).  The 
; location of the image is in a Seahorse-Valley-like area of its 
; multi-bayed parent.  In this valley, the filaments extending 
; from buds end in ring-shaped loops with various decorations and 
; open areas along the loops.  These ring-like features are very 
; common in fractals that combine two negative powers of Z with 
; the reciprocal of C.
; 
; In the image, we are looking deep into one of the decorations in 
; the interior of a ring.  The ring theme infests the image, which 
; is filled with rings and parts of rings.  There are tiny rings 
; at the peaks of the hills, and gigantic rings out beyond the 
; borders of the image.  I might have named the image "Ringworld" 
; had that name not already been taken.
; 
; After a bit of critical consideration, (I CAN think critically), 
; I rated the image at an above-average 7.  The coloring at least 
; has somewhat of a theme, and the image is actually rather 
; pleasant to look at.
; 
; The 9-minute render time from the parameter file is a bit slow, 
; but not beyond reason on a Sunday, the day set aside for fun and 
; rest.  The minor task of rendering may be escaped by downloading 
; the completed GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The Saturday weather here at Fractal Central turned out to be 
; even warmer than Friday's.  The temperature reached 88F 31C, but 
; drier air and a fresh breeze kept things within comfort.  
; Approving of the conditions, the fractal cats spent several 
; hours in the yard, behaving like the angels which they most 
; certainly are not.
; 
; It is now Sunday morning, and I've got to think of something to 
; do this afternoon that will make the day at least slightly 
; memorable.  If I were to find the world's best fractal, that 
; would do it, but if I did find the best fractal, how would I 
; know it?  What makes some fractals good and others not as good?  
; If fractals had never been discovered (or invented?) would there 
; still be good and less-good fractals?  While I'm pondering these 
; not-quite-monumental questions, I just might go out and have a 
; bit of a good time.  Until next time, which will arrive in about 
; 24 hours, take care, and continue the search for eternal, if not 
; universal truth, which, like fractal worth, might also be a 
; by-product of the human way of thinking.
