; FOTD -- October 22, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's image, I stayed in the same parent fractal that 
; produced the past two FOTD images.  The parent fractal consists 
; of a group of weird-shaped Mandeloids, with a jagged filament 
; leading from the eastern-most figure to an immense ring lying 
; farther to the east.  Today's image is located in the area where 
; the filament joins the ring.
; 
; Other disconnected rings lie scattered even farther to the east, 
; but these are not involved in today's image.  I may visit these 
; far-out areas in a future FOTD however.
; 
; The FOTD for today has mixed themes within its single image.  
; The ovaloid elements extending straight out from the center 
; midget create a feeling of rigid inflexibility, while an element 
; of chaos is added by the twisting, jagged filaments in the 
; discontinuities, which cut off parts of some ovaloids.
; 
; I named today's picture"New World Symphony".  There is an actual 
; New World Symphony, which, though it is one of my favorites, has 
; no connection to the image. The name merely expresses a vague 
; feeling of the nature of the scene.
; 
; I was about to rate the image at a 7, but then I recognized the 
; resemblance to several earlier FOTD's and decided to drop the 
; rating to a 6.  This is still above average, but only slightly.
; 
; The render time of the parameter file is a nominal 8 minutes on 
; my aging fractal computer.  That time will be correspondingly 
; shorter on newer, faster machines.  The image may be seen by 
; running the parameter file, or by downloading it from one of the 
; FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Monday here at F.C. was rather pleasant for late 
; October.  Morning clouds burned off by noon, leading to a sunny 
; mild afternoon with a temperature of 61F 16C.  The dynamic cats 
; took full advantage of the mild conditions by lurking several 
; hours in the holly thicket, where the holly berries, which 
; decorate at Christmas and feed the wintering birds, are just 
; beginning to ripen.
; 
; As for me, I'm just beginning another day's work, and it's time 
; to turn off the fractal mode until the work is finished.  Until 
; tomorrow near this same time, take care, and take your fractals 
; one day at a time.
