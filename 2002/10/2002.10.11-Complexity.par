; FOTD -- October 11, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD image is named "Complexity" not because it was 
; created with complex numbers, but rather because it is a very 
; complex image.  Much of the complexity has been achieved by 
; rendering the scene with the outside set to <atan> and the 
; inside set to <bof61>.  These settings are a departure from my 
; usual equal-iteration bands on the outside and a blank black on 
; the inside.
; 
; The parent fractal takes 0.0145 part of Z^(11) and adds 1.6095 
; parts of (1/Z) to it before adding (1/C).  The resulting fractal 
; appears as a somewhat distorted M-set rotated 180 degrees.  
; Today's scene is located in some unlikely chaos on a filament of 
; a bud in the East Valley area of the parent, which in today's 
; case is located on the west side of the main bay.
; 
; In addition to the unusual inside and outside fills in today's 
; image, the bailout also plays a part in the final appearance.  I 
; have set the bailout radius to 2.076, which is just above the 
; point where the scene goes totally blank.  Unlike fractals with 
; negative exponents of Z, fractals with positive exponents do not 
; evaporate when the bailout is increased.  They do change however 
; as the bailout is reduced to near the cutoff point, though to a 
; lesser degree.  To see the unchanged version, reset the imag(p3) 
; parameter to zero and recalculate the image.
; 
; I was about to toss aside today's image with a rating of an 
; average 5, but then I stepped back from the screen and noticed 
; that, from a distance, the image looks surprisingly good.  I 
; finally settled on a rating of 6.
; 
; The render time of 8 minutes from the parameter file is a bit 
; slow.  The better way to see the image is to download it in 
; completed form from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Thursday here at the Fractal Central was simply 
; terrible.  It rained steadily from dawn until midnight, with a 
; temperature around 61F 16C.  This kept the cats confined to the 
; indoors and resulted in them being quite unhappy through most of 
; the day.  In the evening, I gave them a treat of turkey, which 
; lightened their moods -- at least a bit.
; 
; For a change, I have very little to do today, except search for 
; fractals.  Since it's still raining, that's probably what I'll 
; do.  Until tomorrow, take care, and keep your spirits up -- if 
; you can find them that is.
