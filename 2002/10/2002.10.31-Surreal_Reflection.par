; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's Halloween day here at Fractal Central, the day when we 
; pretend that ghosts and ghoulies are real and hope that they are 
; not.  In recognition of the day, I have found a fractal so 
; different from my usual unending string of midgets that I can't 
; rate it.  The situation is downright spooky.
; 
; The generating expression combines some Z^(-7.7) with ten times 
; as much Z^(-0.77), then adds (1/C).  With an escape radius of 
; one-googol, the resulting image is a blank black screen 
; consisting totally of trapped inside points.  Anything that 
; might have once been there has evaporated.
; 
; But all hope is not yet lost, for the blackness is filled with 
; invisible dynamics that can be made visible with the various 
; inside fills.  The <epscr> fill creates an impressive and 
; intricate pattern, but for today's image I chose the <bof60> 
; fill, which tends to draw circles and glowing auras around 
; objects.
; 
; The result of my efforts is a surreal image in which an 
; indescribable object is suspended over a glassy surface, with 
; the object's distorted reflection visible in the glassy surface. 
; I named the image "Surreal Reflection" as a simple description 
; of the scene.
; 
; I leave the rating of the image to the viewer.  Those who enjoy 
; such pictures will rate it higher than a 5; those who do not 
; will rate it lower.  But all will agree that the render time of 
; 54 minutes is excessive.  This delay in seeing the image can be 
; avoided by downloading the pre-rendered image from Paul's web 
; site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; where the GIF image will soon be posted.
; 
; The weather Wednesday was totally miserable, with clouds, a 
; steady cold rain, and a chilling wind.  Even if it had been dry 
; outside, the temperature of 36F 2C was far too cold for the 
; cats' delicate ears and whiskers.  They passed the day indoors, 
; watching raindrops trickle down the windows and asking for food.
; 
; Today is still cloudy and cold, but at least it's dry.  That's a 
; small improvement.  The far bigger improvement will come when 
; the work is finished.  But before I can finish, I must start, so 
; until tomorrow, when the first FOTD of November will appear, 
; take care, and pause to ponder the impossible.
