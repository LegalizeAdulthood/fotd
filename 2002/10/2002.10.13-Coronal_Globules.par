; FOTD -- October 13, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As viewers and readers of the FOTD know, most of my FOTD images 
; are centered on a quadratic midget that lies in a critical plane 
; of a fractal created by adding two different powers of Z to 
; either C or 1/C.  The important word here is 'most'.  
; Occasionally, as in yesterday's 'antlers' image, which showed 
; the entire chaotic part of the fractal, there is no midget to be 
; seen.
; 
; Today's image is a return to yesterday's fractal.  I returned 
; today to search for midgets, and found one that looks as though 
; it is about to vanish beyond the bailout radius.  Searching the 
; surroundings of this midget, I found a spot where the entire 
; character of the area suffers a sudden change, and did further 
; searching there.  I soon found a midget of apparently average 
; quality.
; 
; But as I was working with this sub-midget, trying to find 
; something where little existed, the surroundings caught my 
; attention.  As I discovered, the interest in this area lies not 
; in the midget, but in its surroundings.  I settled on an area to 
; the northwest of the midget, colored it with the < tdis > 
; option, and named the result "Coronal Globules".  One glance at 
; the image will reveal why I gave it that name.
; 
; The original midget is not lost however.  It lies a short 
; distance southeast of today's image, and well might appear as a 
; FOTD in the near future.  For those (if any) who want to see the 
; rejected midget at once, an outzoom will reveal the exact 
; location, and the midget can then be zoomed in upon.
; 
; I have rated today's image at a 6, which is a little above 
; average.  The render time of 23 minutes is a little below 
; average however.  But relief in the form of a pre-rendered image 
; file ready for download is available on the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; If the image is not quite worth 23 minutes of rendering, it is 
; certainly worth a minute or two of download time.
; 
; The weather Saturday here at Fractal Central was an improvement 
; over the day before, but the temperature of 68F 20C accompanied 
; by fog, drizzle, and most importantly, wet grass, kept the 
; dynamic fractal cats once again confined to the indoors, where 
; their paws and whiskers remained dry. 
; 
; Today appears to be a repeat, so I suspect that before the day 
; is finished, I'll be breaking out a tuna treat for the 
; housebound duo.  I'm now going to try to do as little work as 
; possible for the rest of the day, before the more serious work 
; arrives tomorrow.  Until next time, in 24 hours, take care, and 
; discipline your fractals with caution.
