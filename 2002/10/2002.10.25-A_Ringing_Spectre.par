; FOTD -- October 25, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image continues the same theme as the most recent three 
; images.  One negative part of Z^(-14.14) was added to six 
; negative parts of Z^(-1.414) before 1/C was added.  The relation 
; to the square root of 2 is intentional.  The resulting parent 
; fractal consists of the same large many-lobed Mandeloid as the 
; past three FOTD's, but in this case, the enormous rings to the 
; east are missing.
; 
; The northern bay of the parent is partly obscured by two thick 
; arms extending toward its mouth, which create the impression 
; that the area is not critical and therefore no midgets will be 
; found there.  However, in the worlds created by the M-mix4 
; formula, things are not always as they first appear, and a 
; closer examination of the eastern arm revealed suspiciously 
; symmetrical areas.  When I dove down into one of these areas, I 
; did indeed find a perfect quadratic midget.
; 
; The entire area is in a state that I call 'eroded', with the 
; normally solid outside elements broken by numerous holes, which 
; in many cases are larger than the midget itself.  When the scene 
; is calculated at the default bailout radius of 100, the holes 
; are so numerous that they comprise the greater part of the 
; scene.  When this situation exists, the better fractals are 
; often found when the remaining outside material is 'evaporated' 
; by raising the bailout radius to one-googol, leaving only the 
; ghost of the midget that was once there.  It is this midget-
; ghost that is visible in today's image, which totally consists 
; of trapped 'inside' points.  The ghost is made manifest by the 
; inside fill of bof61.
; 
; With its 3-D effect, the ghost-midget rates a conservative 7, 
; perhaps a liberal 8.  I decided on the lesser rating; I could 
; just as honestly have chosen the 8.  (Is today's image really 
; one whole rating beneath yesterday's?)
; 
; I have no explanation for the name I gave the image -- "A 
; Ringing Spectre", but the words have a poetic quality that 
; rather matches the feeling of the blue and gold image.
; 
; The 12-minute render time is somewhat slow, making the download 
; the wiser but not quite as much fun choice.  The download may be 
; found at both Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Thursday was most unpleasant here at F.C., 
; with heavy clouds, a raw northeast wind, occasional drizzle, and 
; a temperature of 43F 6C.  The dynamic cats were very undynamic 
; as they passed the day in their favorite chairs, stirring only 
; to look outside and eat.
; 
; Today promises to be a gloomy repeat, so I guess it's a good 
; chance to get ahead on some of the work I've been putting off.  
; Until tomorrow, take care, and we have evaporated milk, why not 
; evaporated fractals?
