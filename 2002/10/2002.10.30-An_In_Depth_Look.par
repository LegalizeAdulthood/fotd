; FOTD -- October 30, 2002 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Since yesterday's FOTD I have been pondering, (I ponder a lot).  
; I have been pondering the multiple-worlds interpretation of Q.M. 
; If taken literally, this theory implies that there are a near 
; infinity of myselves in a near infinity of alternate universes, 
; living every possible life I might have lived.
; 
; At the same time, experience shows that I can be in only one 
; place at a time.  Can I trust experience?  If so, who then are 
; these other versions of myself?  And how can they be different 
; versions of myself?  If they merely look like me, they are not 
; me, they are my identical twins.  Are they unconscious auto-
; matons?  If so, I might be justified in claiming that everyone 
; in this world but myself is an automaton, an unconscious 
; reflection of someone who is conscious only in some remote 
; alternate universe.
; 
; And when, if ever, does an alternate version of myself stop 
; being me?  In a world where I merely blink one extra time, the 
; other version is clearly myself.  But what of the worlds where 
; I am born a woman in Mongolia in the year 1347?  How can that 
; person be said to be me if I am not aware of her?  What of the 
; worlds where I am born a Neanderthal woman?  And the worlds 
; where I am born an ape or a bacteria, or a mud-skimmer on a 
; planet in the Virgo cluster?  Taken to the extreme, it appears 
; I might end up living through every possible experience every 
; possible conscious living thing could possibly experience.  
; There would even be a world where I am one of the fractal cats, 
; and the cat is me!  (But, unless fractals are conscious, there 
; is no world where I am a fractal.)
; 
; Or is there?  Maybe if I properly understood certain esoteric 
; things such as coherence-decoherence and consistent histories, 
; paradoxes such as the above would vanish, or at least become 
; less puzzling.  Alas, I am not among the anointed high priests 
; of science, the initiated few to whom these mysteries are 
; revealed by means of arcane mathematics.
; 
; Today's fractal might not be aware of itself, but I am certainly 
; aware of it.  And it is no puzzle at all.  The generating 
; expression takes a bit of (1/Z), adds a tiny bit of Z^8 to it, 
; and finally adds (1/C).  The resulting fractal is a bulging 
; Mandeloid rotated 180 degrees, with the period-5 buds being the 
; largest.  Today's scene is located on a side branch near the tip 
; of the tiny main stem that extends out from the tiny period-2 
; bud.
; 
; Most of the worth of the image lies in the fiery coloring.  The 
; underlying shapes are nothing spectacular.  After an exhaustive 
; study, I decided to rate the picture at a 6.  I named it "An 
; In-Depth Look" because of the time expended on the exhaustive 
; study.
; 
; In most cases, the render time of under one minute will be 
; faster than the download of the completed GIF image file from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The decision is left to the individual fractalist.
; 
; The weather here at Fractal Central on Tuesday was truly 
; abysmal.  A cold steady rain mixed with ice pellets, a 
; temperature of 37F 3C and a biting northeast wind kept the 
; dynamic cats housebound the entire day.  Even a tuna treat 
; failed to pull them totally out of their funks.
; 
; And today is once again starting out abysmally.  It will make no 
; difference for my work, but the cats will have another bad day.  
; Until tomorrow and the next FOTD, take care, and take it one 
; fractal at a time.
