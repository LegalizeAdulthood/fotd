; FOTD -- October 12, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal takes around 0.7 part of Z^(-0.05) and adds 
; 1/10th as much Z^(-11) to it before adding 1/C.  The resulting 
; fractal is a grossly bloated empty circle on the verge of 
; turning inside-out, with a bit of chaos on its western shore.  
; Today's image focuses on this chaos, which is filled with 
; curiously twisted quadratic midgets.  I may investigate these 
; midgets further in the days to come.  Today however, I have 
; concentrated on the entire area of chaos.
; 
; At first glance, today's scene appears to have L-R symmetry.  
; But the symmetry is an illusion.  A second glance will reveal 
; small differences in the left and right halves of the picture.
; 
; Today's image is rotated 90 degrees and stretched in its 
; vertical direction.  This stretching of the chaos distorts it 
; into something that vaguely resembles a rack of moose antlers.  
; When searching for fractal names, if I see even the slightest 
; resemblance to something, that is enough to supply a name.  In 
; today's case, it justified the name "Antlers in Sight".
; 
; The background of the image consists of bof60 inside fill; the 
; ground at the bottom is normal outside material.  The whole 
; thing is of average FOTD quality, and in fact, much like the 
; images I produced so many of in the early FOTD's.  I rated it at 
; an average 5.
; 
; The 2-1/2 minute render time is reasonable for such an average 
; image, and that time can be reduced by 40 percent by changing 
; the passes from 1 to g.  But even 1-1/2 minutes is a bit longer 
; than would be required to download the completed image from: 
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The temperature Friday here at F.C. reached 68F 20C, but the 
; weather was terrible.  It poured rain all day, accumulating over 
; 4 inches (or 10cm) by evening.  The cats of the fractal variety 
; sat all day on their shelves by the windows, watching the rain 
; and sulking because they could not go out.  A treat of tuna in 
; the evening cheered them somewhat, but could not come close to 
; making up for the day of forced confinement.
; 
; It's still cloudy this morning, though no rain is falling.  As 
; soon as the grass dries, the dynamic duo will be unleashed into 
; the yard.  (Dynamic fractal cats do not like their paws wet.)  
; As for me, I'm going to take it as slow as possible and enjoy 
; the temporary lull in the work load as much as possible.  But 
; unless the world ends, I'll return tomorrow with a new and 
; hopefully better fractal.  Until then, take care, and relax.
