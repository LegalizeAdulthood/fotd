; FOTD -- October 16, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is a drawn-out string of 
; Mandeloid fractals much like the Hawaiian chain of volcanic 
; islands.  Today's image itself is located in a valley of the 
; easternmost and not at all the largest of these Mandeloids.  The 
; other Mandeloids are all interesting, and may be visited in 
; future FOTD excursions.
; 
; The midget at the center of today's FOTD is located in a spiral, 
; the edge of which is cut off by a discontinuity.  In keeping 
; with the cutoff theme, the large spiral surrounding the midget 
; is also cut off.
; 
; The most impressive thing in today's image is the unusually well 
; defined area surrounding the midget.  I have emphasized the 
; definition of this area by the coloring I gave to it.  The 
; well-defined area reminds me of nothing that I can immediately 
; recognize, yet it seems to be a something.  I therefore named 
; the picture "Mandelbrot Object".  This name will suffice, though 
; fractals are certainly not objects in the accepted sense of the 
; word.
; 
; Though I am fairly satisfied with today's image, the coloring 
; still leaves a bit to be desired, especially the outer areas, 
; where the bland beige fails to bring out the full potential of 
; the scene.  Also, the midget at the center suffers from too low 
; a maxiter.  Considering these shortcomings and the excessive 
; render time of over 1 hour on my machine, I could rate the image 
; no higher than a 7, which is actually quite good.
; 
; Luckily, the completed image, if it is not already on the FOTD 
; web sites, will soon be available there.  The FOTD web sites can 
; be found at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Tuesday here at Fractal Central was typical of the 
; season, as grey clouds veiled the sun, a cool northerly breeze 
; blew, and the temperature hovered around 55F 13C.  The dynamic 
; cats, having seen a TV show about what happens to feral cats in 
; the Australian outback, looked twice before venturing into the 
; holly thicket at the foot of the yard.  This morning, the wind 
; is blowing and the rain is pouring.  I imagine they will look 
; three times before going outdoors.
; 
; As for me, the only adventure I want is to complete the day's 
; work with a minimum of trouble, and find a fractal that rates a 
; 9 or 10 for tomorrow's FOTD, which will appear on schedule in 
; roughly 24 hours.  Until that apocalyptic moment, take care, and 
; did you know that fractals are good for your health?  They're 
; full of isofractones!
