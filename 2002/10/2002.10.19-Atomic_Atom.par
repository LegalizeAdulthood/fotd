; FOTD -- October 19, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Mandelbrot midgets are sometimes called atoms.  Today's image 
; shows one of these atoms, this one in the fractal that results 
; when a negative portion of Z^1.5 is mixed with half as much 
; negative Z^3, and 1/C is added.  But this is not all bad, for 
; though the portions are negative, the result is positive.
; 
; The atom (midget) at the center is the center of attention.  It 
; lies in a spiral in a broad blunt valley of the parent fractal, 
; which is a monstrously bloated, oversized thing that cannot be 
; described, and must be seen to be believed.  No wonder I named 
; the image "Atomic Atom".
; 
; When considering what rating I should give the image, I was 
; struck by the fact that, despite the generating formula and 
; grotesque shape of the parent fractal, today's scene could 
; easily lie in the classic Mandelbrot set.  It contains little 
; that cannot be found in the well-known East Valley area of the 
; M-set.  I could therefore rate it no higher than a 4, which is 
; only a little below average.
; 
; And now I must make a confession.  I actually had found a far 
; better fractal for today's FOTD, but in my haste I shut down the 
; program without saving the image or parameters, and the image 
; went back to that vast reservoir where undiscovered fractals 
; exist.  Oh well, no one is perfect.
; 
; The render time of 7 minutes from the parameter file is a bit 
; slow, but still reasonable, especially considering that it's 
; Saturday, when many are off from work.  And as always, the 
; completed GIF image will promptly be available on Paul's FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and on Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Friday here at Fractal Central was a splendid 
; example of Autumn in this part of the world -- deep blue skies 
; filled with fluffy white clouds, invigorating north winds, and a 
; temperature of 59F 15C.  The dynamic duo of fractal cats voiced 
; their approval by getting into a noisy quarrel on the porch in 
; the afternoon.  Only they know what they started fighting about, 
; but common sense prevailed, and the affair ended before blows 
; were struck.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy however.  I'd better give the grass one 
; final trimming before rain starts to fall.  Until tomorrow, take 
; care, and continue taking care.
