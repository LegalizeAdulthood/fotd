; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Sometimes, while discussing fractals, I remark that the image on 
; the screen is but a slice through an abstract four-dimensional 
; object.  When I say this, the question is often asked, 'where is 
; the fourth dimension?'  I then reply by stating that the fourth 
; dimension is sideways to the inside of solid objects, and of 
; course, the person I am talking with remarks that such a direc-
; tion does not and cannot exist because there is no space for it.
; 
; The real difficulty with the fourth, and all higher dimensions, 
; is that we cannot visualize them.  Early in life, we learn to 
; decipher and organize our sensory input so that it forms in our 
; minds the image a three-dimensional exterior world.  The image 
; works quite well because all people, (with the possible excep-
; tion of the insane), have formed the same image.  That world 
; might or might not resemble our mental images of it, but what 
; if, perhaps with the aid of virtual-reality computers, a child 
; in his formative years were fed images of a four-dimensional 
; world.  Could that child then grow to visualize four-dimensional 
; space and all the figures that might exist in it?
; 
; Maybe he could, maybe not.  We'll never know because the experi-
; ment will never be done.  But I can't help but wonder whether a 
; three-dimensional reality actually exists 'out there' or whether 
; we learn early in live to organize our mental impressions into a 
; world of three dimensions, and then go on to invent a math-
; ematics that works with that three-dimensional image.
; 
; I mention the fourth dimension because it is one of my favorite 
; topics of contemplation when I settle into my ponder chair, and 
; also because in the upcoming FOTD's I will often be discussing 
; the fourth dimension.
; 
; Today's image is part of a critical Mandel-plane of the four-
; dimensional julibrot that results when 1 part of Z^2.2, 2.2 
; parts of Z, and C are added and iterated.  The two prominent 
; spirals are impressive, and inspired the name "The Great 
; Spirals".  But it takes more than two spirals to make a great 
; fractal, so I could rate the image no more than an average 5.
; 
; With a render time of 13 minutes, the parameter file is slow.  
; The good news is that the completed GIF image will soon be ready 
; for download on the two FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Friday here at Fractal Central started with low 
; clouds and fog, which then gave way to hazy sun and an afternoon 
; temperature of 81F 27C.  Ignoring the high humidity, the cats 
; approved of the conditions, and showed their approval by sitting 
; on the porch, guarding the yard through most of the afternoon.
; 
; I'm now going to try to take it easy for the rest of the day.  
; If I'm lucky, no work will appear; if I'm unlucky, a few minor 
; tasks might arise.  Being a firm believer in Murphy's Law, I 
; expect to be unlucky.  In any case, the next FOTD will appear 
; tomorrow around the same time at the same place.
