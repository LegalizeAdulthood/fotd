; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In fantastic adventure games, where intrepid armchair explorers 
; venture into computerized worlds of danger, lava pits are 
; sometimes found.  These pits of boiling, bubbling molten rock 
; are just one of the many hazards that block the way to the 
; ultimate goal.  If stumbled into, these pits can be fatal to the 
; adventurer . . . that is unless he has in his possession a magic 
; charm of some sort that can enable him to survive things that 
; would ordinarily mean instant death and a trip back to the 
; beginning of the game or level.
; 
; I mention computer adventure games because today's image reminds 
; me of a lava pit, with bridges of fractal debris spanning the 
; chasm beneath.  I promptly named it "Bubbling Lava Pit".  No one 
; has yet fallen into the pit, though many have come close.  
; Hopefully, this pit will claim no victims in the future.
; 
; The formula behind the image is based on the golden ratio, where 
; <a> is to <b> as <a+b> is to <c>.  In today's case, I took the 
; negative value and subtracted from it half as much of the 
; negative of its squared value, which simply adds the number one 
; to the original value.  The result of this trick is a Mandeloid 
; that resembles two partially coalesced Mandelbrot sets.  The 
; East Valley area of this figure is relatively undistorted, and 
; that is where I found today's scene.
; 
; When searching for a rating, I looked at yesterday's image and 
; compared it with today's.  An honest comparison led me to a 
; rating of 6, which is still above average but only slightly.  
; The render time of around 4 minutes is in line with the worth of 
; the finished result.  And as always, the finished image is 
; available on the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Heavy rain fell during the pre-dawn hours Saturday here at 
; Fractal Central, but by mid-morning the clouds departed and the 
; temperature soon rose to 66F 19C.  By afternoon, the grass was 
; dry, which gave the dynamic duo the chance they needed to catch 
; up on lost outdoor time.  The extra time outdoors made them so 
; happy that they almost forgot to ask for food when they returned 
; inside.
; 
; It's now Sunday morning.  We made it through Saturday with no 
; unexpected disasters and a minimum of work.  Hopefully, today 
; will be a repeat.  Until next time, take care, and then have a 
; little fun.
