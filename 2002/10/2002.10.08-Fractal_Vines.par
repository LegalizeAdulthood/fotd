; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's quickly-found fractal is a simple thing.  With the 
; MandelbrotBC1 formula I calculated the Z^(3.01)+C Mandeloid and 
; examined the area of the negative X-axis where the western 
; 'Seahorse' valley is beginning to split.  I really had no need 
; for the M-BC1 formula, since I could have done the same thing 
; with Fractint's built-in manzpower formula.  The resulting 
; figure would not have been exactly the same, but the character-
; istics of the midgets in the area would have been similar.
; 
; As I studied the image, I fancied myself looking down through a 
; jungle of fractal material, toward a cubic midget on the forest 
; floor.  I considered naming the image "Fractal Jungle", but the 
; name seemed so obvious that I finally decided on "Fractal 
; Vines".  And the name is not too far off the mark.  The tangles 
; and loops do resemble vines hanging from trees.  Unfortunately, 
; the end result is once again only of average fractal quality, 
; and I could rate it no higher than a 5.
; 
; While working with fractals, I like to consider the outside 
; parts as material and the inside as empty space, which is why I 
; usually color the inside parts of my fractals a dead black.  
; This viewpoint has become my basic fractal world-view.  Surpris-
; ingly, such a view is not too far removed from what is commonly 
; known as the 'real' world-view, in which a vast empty space is 
; seen as filled with tiny islands of material known as stars, 
; planets, etc., all of which, for convenience, is granted an 
; attribute known as objective reality.  And the more one studies 
; the current theories of physics, such as super-strings and super-
; symmetry, the more one realizes that the 'real' world appears to 
; be made of numbers.
; 
; Why, I wonder, can't the world of fractals also be considered 
; 'real'.  It also is made of numbers; it has its empty spaces and 
; its clumps of 'material'.  As the 'real' world needs the human 
; senses to make itself manifest, the fractal world needs compu-
; ters to make itself manifest.  Are the two worlds as different 
; as they seem?  Would it truly be so surprising if, when the much 
; publicized 'theory of everything' is finally found, (if it is 
; ever found), it turns out to be a fractal?
; 
; If all this speculation seems confusing, relief may be found in 
; 5 minutes by rendering the parameter file and watching the 
; festooned vines come into existence, remembering of course that 
; they are vines only because I have declared them to be vines.
; 
; A quicker, simpler method of viewing the image is to visit 
; Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download the completed GIF image from there.
; 
; On Monday, Scott's site got its script signals crossed, but I 
; assume his site is up and running today at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The image may also be downloaded from there.
; 
; Except for a brief period of cloudiness in the afternoon, the 
; fractal weather Monday here at Fractal Central was ideal.  The 
; fractal duo would rather have had more sun, but the temperature 
; of 77F 25C was good enough to keep them in a good humor.
; 
; Today promises to be a near-perfect repeat, so the dynamic duo 
; should stay happy most all day.  My own happiness will come when 
; I finish a bit of work that seems to always appear when I expect 
; a slow day.  Until 24 hours or so from now, take care, and think 
; for yourself.
