; FOTD -- October 17, 2002 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There has been a notable lack of critical thinking in the 
; Fractal Central area lately.  Critical thinking is what 
; skeptics, as well as fractalists, do so much of, and what 
; believers in unlikely things do so little of.  Those who think 
; critically will explain events as simply and rationally as 
; possible.  They will not use questionable phenomena such as 
; mental telepathy as an explanation when a normal explanation 
; such as somehow receiving the information through the senses 
; will work as well.  There is a good reason for this -- the 
; simplest, most reasonable, explanation is most often the right 
; one.
; 
; A rash of shootings have taken place in the area lately, and the 
; sniper has so far eluded capture.  To me, the explanation is 
; simple -- most likely a very clever maniac is on the loose, or 
; possibly it is the beginning of the next phase of foreign 
; terrorism in the U.S.  The shootings are almost certainly not 
; some of the things I have been hearing, such as the beginning of 
; an alien invasion from outer space, or a racist plot to make the 
; ethnically-mixed police department look bad, or a plot to swing 
; the upcoming election in favor of the candidate who wants 
; tighter gun control.  I doubt that the shootings are the begin-
; ning of Armageddon, as I have heard one woman very seriously 
; claim.  I wonder how long it will be before the psychics appear 
; on the scene with so many different explanations that one of 
; them is certain to be correct.
; 
; Oh, we have a fractal today.  I named it "Mandel Fragments" 
; because of its extremely fragmentary nature.  The generating 
; expression combines various negative portions of Z^(-1.2) and 
; Z^(-11.7).  The fractal is then turned outside-in by adding 1/C 
; instead of just plain C.
; 
; The midget at the center of today's image is a third-order one, 
; lying near the southeast border of a larger midget that lies in 
; the East Valley area of a still larger midget, which in turn 
; lies in a valley of the parent, which consists of oversized but 
; scattered Mandeloid figures.
; 
; Try as I might, I could see nothing in the final product that is 
; above the long-term FOTD average.  I therefore rated it at an 
; average 5.  The unreasonably long render time of 1-3/4 hours 
; does nothing to raise the image out of the realm of the mundane.
; 
; But do not give up hope of seeing the image.  Relief will soon 
; arrive in the form of the finished GIF image, which will be 
; available on the FOTD web sites as soon as Paul and Scott can 
; render it.  Paul's site may be accessed at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and Scott's at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Wednesday featured, if it could be called a 
; feature, heavy rain, strong winds, and a temperature of 57F 14C. 
; The cats seemed to know early that it would not be an outdoor 
; day, and satisfied themselves watching the raindrops trickle 
; down the windows.  Surprisingly, the sun did break through late 
; in the afternoon, though it was still too wet outside for the 
; dynamic duo's paws.
; 
; Today is beginning much more pleasantly, both for man and cats.  
; The sun is shining, it is warmer, and the amount of work to be 
; done is reasonable.  I think it might be a good day.  Until 
; tomorrow, take care, and beware of the fractal conspiracy.
