; FOTD -- October 18, 2002 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I enjoy surreal art, especially when it speaks of other 
; realities.  I also feel that surrealism is not total fantasy, 
; for in all likelihood, other unseen realities surround and 
; enclose our familiar reality much as the planet itself is 
; surrounded and enclosed by space.  This belief does not conflict 
; with the critical thinking I mentioned in yesterday's FOTD.  
; Critical thinking does not determine one's world view, rather 
; one's world view determines whether critical thinking can show 
; that person the way to the *entire* truth.
; 
; Today's critically surreal FOTD image takes us to a totally 
; alien world, where Mandelbrot buds line the ridge of a slight 
; hill, and bits of fractal debris swirl about in the gentle 
; breeze.  The entire scene is illuminated by an unseen source of 
; light beyond the left edge of the screen.  All that is missing 
; is a bug-eyed alien, and he might pop up over the ridge at any 
; moment.
; 
; The image has several unusual technical features.  To start, 
; other than the few darker green spots with curved edges, the 
; entire scene consists of a blank inside left over from an 
; 'evaporated' fractal.  In this case however, the fractal was not 
; evaporated by raising the bailout to a ridiculous level, it was 
; evaporated by dropping the exponents of Z to 0.5 and -0.5, which 
; equals the square root and reciprocal of the square root of Z.  
; Then C was added to complete the iterated expression.
; 
; I named the image "Periodicity Ten" because its appearance is 
; determined by the setting of the periodicity.  It is rare indeed 
; to see an image so greatly controlled by its periodicity.
; 
; To bring out the details in today's image, I set the inside to 
; < atan >.  The other inside fills also give interesting effects, 
; and are well worth a look.
; 
; The passes must be set to 1 when rendering the image.  Otherwise 
; many of the smaller fragments are missed.
; 
; Unable to decide on the rating of an image so different from my 
; usual fractal fare, I finally decided on an above-average 7.  
; The relatively fast render time of 7-1/2 minutes probably helped 
; in my decision.
; 
; But even 7 minutes is a bit slow for someone with other more-
; pressing tasks waiting to be done.  So for convenience, the 
; pre-rendered GIF image is available on the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Thursday here at Fractal Central started sunny, but 
; turned cloudy in the afternoon, followed by a moderate shower at 
; 5pm.  The dynamic cats had their day's outing early, before the 
; clouds moved in, when it was still sunny and the temperature was 
; 61F 16C.
; 
; My day's outing must wait until the work is finished however.  
; And before I can finish, I must begin.  So until the next FOTD 
; appears in about 24 hours, take care, and be kind to your 
; fractals when they're in critical condition.
