; FOTD -- October 09, 2002 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Despite the ridiculous media attention the local area is getting 
; due to the sniper roaming the vicinity, the fractals continue 
; without interruption.  (And why are six shootings in a week so 
; newsworthy when we have had 23 shootings in the area on a single 
; week-end, which have received less news coverage?)
; 
; Before I get side-tracked into social commentary, let's get to 
; the fractals.
; 
; The name of today's fractal, "Floating Garden", appears rather 
; Japanese, but the image has little in it that could be connected 
; to the orient.  It's actually a scene in the fractal created by 
; adding Z^(3) and 3Z^(0.1), then adding C and iterating with the 
; bailout radius set at an unusually low value of 5.  (The low 
; bailout makes very little difference.)
; 
; The resulting fractal appears as a shattered Mandeloid with its 
; main stem pointing north and its East Valley totally broken up.  
; Today's scene is located at the tip of a filament attached to a 
; bud in a spurious valley that lies in the area where East Valley 
; of the parent fractal would normally be located.
; 
; When rendered in the usual manner, with the outside set to 
; <iter> and the inside set to zero, today's image rates only a 4. 
; With the departures from the normal rendering methods which I 
; used in today's image, it still rates only a 4.
; 
; When I found the scene, I felt it had a 6 or 7 rated fractal in 
; it.  But regardless of what I tried, the stubborn scene just 
; would not improve.  I finally settled on the inside fill of 
; bof60, with the outside decorated by the decomp option, which is 
; a feature I have almost never used since I first tried it and 
; quickly grew bored with its effect of curved, shiny metallic 
; surfaces.
; 
; The name "Floating Garden" was inspired by the curved bits and 
; pieces that appear to be floating in front of a background of 
; infinite space.  The visual effect unfortunately does not live 
; up to the above description of the image.
; 
; The render time of 10 minutes from the parameter file is a bit 
; too much for such a mediocre image.  A download of the completed 
; image file is a far more efficient way of seeing the garden.  
; The download may be found at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; On Tuesday the fractal cats enjoyed the sun, but the temperature 
; in the 50's F, low teens C, was a bit too chilly for their 
; sensitive ears and noses.  They spent only 1/2 hour in the yard. 
; Later in the evening, Tippy defiantly grabbed my favorite chair 
; and told me to not even think of moving him.
; 
; Today it's once again chilly, and with less sun than yesterday, 
; the duo will likely once again be testy.  As for me, when undone 
; work lies before me, I'm always testy, so I'd best get started 
; on that undone work.  Until tomorrow, take care, and be happy 
; when your work is finished.
