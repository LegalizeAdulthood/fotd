; FOTD -- May 11, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal appears undecided.  It cannot make up its mind 
; which way it wants to go, and as a result, its rating suffers.  
; The scene is filled with fragments of themes, any one of which 
; could be developed into a satisfying overall theme, but none of 
; which actually are.  It's no wonder that I named the image "An 
; Undecided Fractal".
; 
; This indecision is caused by the location of the scene in its 
; parent -- exactly on the left edge of the 'fan', where it merges 
; into the chaos surrounding a small irregular hole.  At this 
; particular point, all the forces are balanced.  The situation is 
; unstable, poised at the brink, but there is no trigger to flip 
; the scene into a definite theme.
; 
; As a result of all this indecision, I could rate the overall 
; result no higher than a 5.  The render time of 14 minutes is a 
; bit slow for an image that tries hard but doesn't seem to know 
; in which direction to go.  And that 14-minute wait can be cut 
; drastically by downloading the completed GIF image from either 
; of the two FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; It rained and thundered in the morning of Saturday here at F.C.  
; The rain was not too heavy, but the high humidity and light 
; winds that followed left the grass soaked for the rest of the 
; day, a situation that always keeps the cats' moods less than 
; optimum.  The temperature reached 72F 22C -- comfortable enough 
; -- were it not for the wet grass.  How long it seems since the 
; dynamic duo were actually doing things other than being in moods 
; -- such as climbing trees and catching birds.  But this is what 
; happens to cats when they reach the age of 12 years.
; 
; Well, today is starting with more wet grass, and possible 
; tornadoes are forecast for this afternoon.  So it's time to say 
; 'see you next time', and batten down the fractal hatches.
