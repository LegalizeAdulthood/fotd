; FOTD -- May 22, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is what yesterday's should have been.  Looking at 
; yesterday's image one day later, I see that I over-rated it.  It 
; now looks more like a 6 than a 7.  But regardless of the true 
; value of yesterday's image, today's image, which mirror's 
; yesterday's, rates a true 8.  In fact, if I had more time to 
; color today's image, I might have been able to work it into a 
; 9-rater.  As it is, the colors are a bit gaudy, a flaw which 
; costs one rating point.
; 
; Today's image is located on the northwest edge of the fan, 
; where the fan blends into the surrounding area.  Like 
; yesterday's image, today's lies in a vague spiral arrangement in 
; a kind of pseudo-valley.
; 
; I studied the image for several minutes before I noticed the 
; claw-like features and named it "Fractal Claws".  These claws 
; are not to be confused with Santa Claus, whose reality lies 
; somewhere in the range of today's image.  In both cases, we can 
; see the picture but not the object.
; 
; The always-annoying render time of today's image is 15 minutes 
; on my machine, but can be bypassed by letting Paul and Scott do 
; the rendering and going to one of their web sites to view the 
; image.
; 
; The URL of Paul's site is:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Scott's site is at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The all-day rain here at Fractal Central on Wednesday made the 
; fractal cats very unhappy.  The temperature of 55F 13C made them 
; even more unhappy.  They spent a few minutes under the cover of 
; the porch roof, but soon realized that a pleasant afternoon in 
; the yard was simply not going to happen.  They consoled them-
; selves by sleeping.
; 
; Today promises more of the same, and in addition, I have more 
; work to do.  So until next FOTD, take care, and is today's 
; fractal as real as Santa?
