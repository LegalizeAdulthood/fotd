; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; My e-mail address certainly gets around.  This morning I found 
; 26 letters in my e-mailbox, with the word 'jamth' in the subject 
; line.  I don't know why the senders do this.  Most likely it is 
; an effort to make their ads appear personal, but all it does is 
; make the unwanted ads easier to recognize and delete.  I also am 
; seeing more and more nonsense words such as 'tghs df6szzhs' in 
; the subject lines.  I assume this is an attempt to defeat the 
; programs that automatically delete e-mail spam.  And speaking of 
; spam, I recently saw on the BBC-America channel the original 
; Monty Python skit that inspired the word.  Now if only a way 
; could be found to eliminate spam itself.
; 
; Today's image, which is located in a valley of a distorted bud 
; on the northern fringe of the 'fan' of the may-parent fractal, 
; is striking for the intensity of its colors, especially the 
; blues.  I have named it "Sapphire Jewel" accordingly.
; 
; The unusual shape of the fractal elements alone would rate a 6 
; or 7.  When this is added to the unusually brilliant colors, the 
; sum of the two easily rates the 8.
; 
; Unlike the past two images, today's is very slow.  It takes 43 
; minutes to render on my machine.  Since my machine is an aging 
; clunker, the image will render in considerably less time on most 
; units.  And if even the speediest fireball screamer is too slow, 
; the completed GIF image can be found on the internet at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and downloaded from there.
; 
; Occasional rain much of the day Saturday here at Fractal Central 
; kept the dynamic duo of fractal cats confined to quarters.  The 
; temperature of 59F 15C helped not a bit.  Their moods were 
; lighter than expected however.  Maybe they're getting used to 
; being unable to go out.
; 
; The clouds are still hanging around this morning, with a rather 
; dense fog added to make things even more unpleasant for cats.  
; Regardless, I'm ready to have a relaxing day doing pretty much 
; nothing but searching for the next fractal.  Until I find it, 
; take care, and enjoy the other images.
