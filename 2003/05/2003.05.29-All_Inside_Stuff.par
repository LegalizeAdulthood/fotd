; FOTD -- May 29, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I see on the Fractint list that the 'bug' in the program that 
; has caused the MandelbrotMix4 formula to run incorrectly has 
; been identified and can be fixed without too much effort.  This 
; obviously will have an impact on the upcoming FOTD-CD.
; 
; Until now, I have been feeling a bit guilty about the unreason-
; able delay in releasing the FOTD-CD.  Now however, it appears 
; the delay will be a good thing, for it will enable me to release 
; a disk that does not depend on a bug in the program to render 
; the images correctly.  Of course, this means a further delay in 
; the release of the disk while any needed changes that might 
; arise are being done, but after a delay of nearly a year, that 
; will be of little consequence.  Meanwhile, whenever I find the 
; time, I am still working on the task of identifying and renaming 
; the images on the disk, so that they can be matched with their 
; corresponding discussions without confusion.
; 
; And on a non-fractal topic, I'm now receiving spam snail mail.  
; Yesterday, I received in the snail mail an air-mail letter from 
; Zimbabwe, which is a country in the southern part of Africa.  
; The enclosed letter was a print-out of the same fraudulent offer 
; that I have received so many times in the e-mail.  The letter 
; tells me that a probably fictional Mr. Twala has in his posses-
; sion 9.2-million US dollars that he wants to transfer out of his 
; country.  To do this transfer he needs my bank account number.  
; Once he has the account number, guess what will happen to any 
; money in the account.
; 
; I find it hard to believe that anyone would fall for such an 
; obvious scam, but whoever is sending these letters must be 
; finding some pigeons naive enough to fall for his scheme, 
; because the postage on the envelope amounts to 700 Zimbabwe 
; dollars or whatever their monetary unit is, and he must send out 
; thousands of such letters.  At least the stamps on the envelope, 
; which picture a newly constructed dam, are attractive.
; 
; Today's fractal is also attractive, though not quite as attrac-
; tive as the dam in Zimbabwe.  It is another 'evaporated' image, 
; this one located near the right edge of the fan of the parent 
; fractal.  I named the image "All Inside Stuff" as a description, 
; and rated it a 6 because it is interesting but not that great.
; 
; The render time of 19 minutes is somewhat slow for a 6-rated 
; image, but immediate relief is available at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; It rained all morning here at Fractal Central on Wednesday, then 
; the sun appeared and the afternoon was sunny.  The temperature 
; reached only 65F 18C, when 79F 26C is normal, but the dynamic 
; pair had a great several hours in the yard, enduring the wet 
; grass with little complaint.  Today once again holds a chance of 
; rain.  It remains to be seen how the duo will adjust.
; 
; I'll do my adjusting when the work is done and the next fractal 
; is found.  That time will likely be around 3pm.  Until next time 
; and next FOTD, take care, and don't give up hope for the FOTD-CD.
