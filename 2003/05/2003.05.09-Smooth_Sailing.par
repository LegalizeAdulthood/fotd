; FOTD -- May 09, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Another busy day means another shortened discussion.
; 
; Today's image, with its spectacular curvilinear elements, rates 
; an 8.  Actually, I thought about rating it a 9, but I could not 
; find that definite extra something that would earn the 9.
; 
; I named the image "Smooth Sailing" for no reason that I can 
; state with certainty.  (I think there once was a candy bar named 
; 'Smooth Sailing'.)  Most likely, it is the smoothly curving 
; lines that earned the title.
; 
; The entire scene is located at the tip of the filament extending 
; from the Mandeloid bud at the northeast corner of the parent, 
; slightly past the point where the filament intersects the ring.  
; The scene actually lies in the interior of the ring, which is 
; surprising, as no rings appear in the image.  Usually, the 
; features surrounding midgets are a reflection of the overall 
; area of the parent in which the midgets are located.
; 
; The rather slow render time of 9 minutes can be avoided by 
; downloading the finished image from the W.W.W.  It is available 
; at two web sites.  Paul's site is found at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Scott's is at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather was changeable here at Fractal Central on Thursday.  
; A light shower in the morning gave way to a sunny afternoon with 
; a temperature of 75F 24C, but at nightfall a series of thunder-
; showers passed just to the north.  The duo of cats made the most 
; of the sunny period and did not worry themselves while it was 
; raining or thundering.  This morning is starting foggy and 
; misty, with more rain promised.  It remains to be seen what kind 
; of day the duo will have.
; 
; For me, it's going to be another busy day.  Until next FOTD, 
; take care, and look for those alternate realities hidden within 
; our own.
