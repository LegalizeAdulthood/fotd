; FOTD -- May 28, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; What is the outer limit of the solar system?  Is it the planet 
; Pluto?  No, Pluto, which is hardly worthy of being called a 
; planet, is not the end of the solar system.  Are a few icy rocks 
; a short distance beyond Pluto the limit of the solar system?  
; No.  What then is the end?
; 
; The end of the solar system is the Oort cloud of comets, which 
; surrounds the sun and extends nearly halfway to the nearest 
; star.  These distant chunks of rocky ice drift lazily along in 
; their orbits at a rate of perhaps one meter per second, taking 
; many millions of years to complete one revolution.
; 
; Today's image reminds me of a cloud of comets, such as the Oort 
; cloud.  The resemblance inspired the name "In the Oort Cloud".  
; Of course, the actual comets in the Oort cloud are totally dead. 
; They are not surrounded by a coma of ejected gases, nor are they 
; as crowded together as the 'comets' in the image, but the image 
; bears enough of a resemblance to a cloud of comets to justify 
; its name.
; 
; At this time, I must make a minor confession.  At the beginning 
; of the month, I stated that I would post no 'evaporated' images 
; during the month.  Until today, I have posted none.  But the 
; 'normal' version of today's image that I originally found became 
; so much better when it was evaporated that I could not keep it 
; secret.  The entire image is composed of < bof60 > inside fill.
; 
; The scene of today's image is located inland, near the discon-
; nected area of chaos south of the main body of the mayparent 
; fractal.  Of course, since the scene is an evaporated one, the 
; parent fractal is no longer there.
; 
; When the time came to rate the image, I had no trouble deciding 
; on an 8.  The image truly is an exceptional one (as FOTD images 
; go).  The render time of 16 minutes is not so exceptional, but 
; this minor annoyance can be eliminated by downloading the 
; completed GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Though the clouds were heavy, the expected rain failed to 
; materialize here at Fractal Central on Tuesday, and as a result, 
; the Fractal Central cats had an enjoyable day.  The temperature 
; of 61F 16C was a bit chilly for their sensitive whiskers, but at 
; least the grass was dry when they ventured into the yard for 
; their afternoon exploration.  This morning is once again cloudy 
; and rain is once again threatening.  The duo will have as good a 
; day as they can.
; 
; My day will be as good as the work permits and as good as I make 
; it.  Until next FOTD, take care, and give those Fractint bugs a 
; shot of Raid.
