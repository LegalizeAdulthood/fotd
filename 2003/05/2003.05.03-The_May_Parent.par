; FOTD -- May 03, 2003 (Rating NA)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The Mandelbrot set is sometimes called the most complex object 
; in the world of mathematics.  And it truly is a complex object.  
; But there are other fractal objects created by other fractal 
; formulae, which are more complex than even the M-set.  Of 
; course, since the M-set is infinitely complex, these other 
; objects would appear to demand a higher order of infinity.
; 
; Today's image could be one of these 'higher' fractals.  It is 
; titled "The May Parent".  I give it this name because, for the 
; rest of the month of May, I shall use it as the source of my 
; FOTD images.  This limitation in no way implies a shortage of 
; images or a reduction in their quality, though on occasion I 
; will go beyond my normal style of image with a midget at the 
; center.
; 
; The formula mixes one negative part of Z^(-11) with ten negative 
; parts of Z^(-1.1), then adds 1/C before being calculated with a 
; bailout radius of 625.  In some places, the oversized resulting 
; fractal is filled with holes like a swiss cheese.  In other 
; places, it appears to hold the usual Mandel-stuff.  In yet other 
; places, it is filled with rings, while a prominent fan-shaped 
; element fills the center.  The variety is endless, and the 
; fractal has midgets hiding almost everywhere.
; 
; I gave today's image no rating, since it is not really a 
; finished product, but rather the source of the next 28 FOTD 
; images.  The render time of a little over one-minute should give 
; little difficulty, but for extra convenience, the completed GIF 
; image is posted to the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The rain that was expected here at Fractal Central on Friday 
; never arrived.  Instead of the rain, we had a mostly sunny day 
; with a temperature of 81F 27C.  The fractal cats thoroughly 
; enjoyed the unexpectedly pleasant day, and spent several hours 
; romping in the yard.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy and quite a bit cooler -- once again 
; threatening rain.  Will good fortune prevail, giving the fractal 
; duo another good day?  Only time will tell.  My day will turn 
; good when the work is finished, so until next time, take care, 
; and see you in 24 hours with the next image.
