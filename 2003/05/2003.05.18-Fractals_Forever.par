; FOTD -- May 18, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Sometimes I surprise myself at the way I find midgets in the 
; most unlikely places.  I appear to have become a specialist in 
; finding the little things.  This does not mean that I consider 
; images with midgets (sometimes called molecules or atoms) at the 
; center to be better in any way than fractals without midgets.  
; I simply have unintentionally become a specialist in one type of 
; fractal.
; 
; The midget in today's scene was a total surprise.  The scene is 
; located in the 'handle' of the fan-shaped element of the parent 
; fractal, in an area that appears to be total non-critical chaos 
; with no chance at all that midgets could lie there.  I cannot 
; say what led me to the scene.  As is the case with many of my 
; images, I simply got a feeling, and followed my instincts.  If 
; anyone were to ask me how I find these midgets, my only answer 
; would be 'I don't know'.
; 
; Today's image rates an 8.  If I had given it more effort, it 
; might have rated a 9, which equals one of the best FOTD images 
; of all time.  But an 8 equals an exceptionally good image, and 
; that is nothing to shrug at.
; 
; When I find an (IMO) exceptionally fine image, it renews my 
; enthusiasm.  If this trend continues, I'll be searching for 
; fractals forever.  Recognizing this trend, I named today's image 
; "Fractals Forever".
; 
; Luckily, today's image renders in somewhat less than forever.  
; It renders in 15 minutes, in fact.  And even that 15 minute wait 
; can be avoided by visiting one of the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and downloading the completed GIF image from there.
; 
; Clouds and an unusually cool temperature of 50F 10C prevailed 
; Saturday here at Fractal Central.  The dynamic duo ventured 
; briefly into the yard in the evening when we returned from the 
; day's adventure and let them out, but the wet grass soon sent 
; them back indoors, where they received their treat of tuna.
; 
; Today is promising to be a repeat, with the exception that no 
; more all-day antiquing trips are in the works. Until next FOTD, 
; take care, and walk in peace.
