; FOTD -- May 23, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is different enough to rate an 8.  It has a 
; midget in it, which is the center of attention, but the midget 
; is not at the center of the image.  Most surprising, today's 
; 'exceptional' image is merely a step on the way to the real 
; image, which lies invisibly buried in today's scene, and will 
; rate a 9, which equals 'one of the best of all time', when it 
; appears tomorrow.
; 
; Today's image is named "Isolated Minibrot" for obvious reasons.
; 
; Most of today's scene consists of 'inside' material made visible 
; by the < bof60 > fill.  The areas of radiating bands of color 
; are 'outside' areas that are normally flat, but have been given 
; interest by the < atan > option.  When rendered in the normal 
; manner, the scene consists of large areas of black accented by 
; scattered splotches that at one point in the frame appear to 
; vaguely outline a Mandeloid 'atom'.
; 
; As fractals go in this era of multi-layered and transformed 
; images, today's image might not be considered worth its rating 
; of an exceptional 8.  But after trying those options, which are 
; features of another program and draw images that may or may not 
; be considered real fractals, I rejected them, and decided to 
; stick with the more traditional methods of rendering my 
; fractals.  When today's image is compared with only my past 
; FOTD images, I feel that it does indeed rate an 8.  Whether I 
; have become an old fractal fogy is up to the individual to 
; decide.
; 
; Today's FOTD image is fast, one of the fastest of all time.  It 
; renders in a zippy 38 seconds despite the fact that it consists 
; mostly of trapped points.  In today's case, the download will 
; take somewhat longer than the time required to render the image 
; from the parameter file.  But as always, the download is 
; available on the internet at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The clouds were plentiful here at Fractal Central on Thursday, 
; but the rain held off, the temperature reached an acceptable 61F 
; 16C, and the dynamically fractal cats managed a pleasant after-
; noon in the too-tall grass of the yard.  When a robin swooped 
; carelessly low, Tippy took a swipe at it, but I fear the duo's 
; bird-catching days are pretty much behind them.  Tippy missed 
; the bird by a good meter.  I guess the only birds they will eat 
; from now on will be processed turkeys.
; 
; Rain is in the picture again today, as is a bit of work for me.  
; Hopefully, the fractal duo will resign themselves to a day by 
; the window.  Until next time and next FOTD, take care, and be at 
; ease when surrounded by aggressive fractals.
