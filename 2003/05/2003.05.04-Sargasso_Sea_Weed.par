; FOTD -- May 04, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As I said in yesterday's FOTD, during the month of May I will 
; restrict my fractal explorations to a single fractal -- the 
; fractal that appeared as the FOTD for May 3, which was 
; yesterday.  I am doing this because in my continuing haste to 
; find ever more fractals, I rarely stay with a single fractal 
; long enough to become familiar with its various parts.  And this 
; parent fractal that I have chosen for May is one of the most 
; varied I have yet found.
; 
; Today we take our first venture into the parent fractal for May, 
; which will serve as the parent of the FOTD images that will 
; appear during the rest of the month.  Today's image is located 
; in the area where the edge of the large fan-like element merges 
; into the 'East Valley' area of the obvious Mandel-shape on the 
; right.
; 
; I have named the image "Sargasso Seaweed".  I gave it this name 
; because something about it reminds me of rafts of seaweed lazily 
; floating on a nearly calm ocean.  But I could easily have given 
; the image a name such as "Holey Iterations", since it has more 
; holes than one can shake a golf course at.
; 
; These holes are not Mandelbrot midgets, nor are they Julia sets. 
; In fact, I don't know what they are, except just plain 'holes'.  
; Such holes often appear in images created with the MandelbrotMix 
; series of formulae.  They also appear in certain parts of some 
; fractals created with the MandelbrotBC1 formula, which draws the 
; more remote levels of the fractals that contain a fractional 
; power of Z.
; 
; Today's image undergoes some curious changes when the bailout 
; radius, which is the imag(p3) parameter, is raised to a 
; sufficiently high value.  These changes are the beginning of 
; fractal 'evaporation'.  They appear suddenly and unexpectedly.  
; Finding the exact point of the beginning of fractal breakup is a 
; challenging task, though in some cases, worth the effort.
; 
; I used the MandelbrotMix2 formula to create the parent fractal 
; for May, as well as all images that will appear during this 
; month.  This formula works exactly like the MandelbrotMix4 
; formula except that it has two additional changeable parameters, 
; which can be used to change the starting point of Z.
; 
; After studying today's image for all of 5 minutes, I decided 
; that it was worth a rating of an above-average 7.  The render 
; time of 20 minutes, at least on my machine, is a bit slow, but 
; relief can be found on the internet in the form of the completed 
; image, which is or soon will be posted to the FOTD web sites.  
; Paul's site is at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>

; Scott's is at:

;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; On Saturday, good luck once again prevailed here at Fractal 
; Central.  There was little sun, but the rain held off and the 
; temperature reached 63F 17C, producing conditions that any 
; fractal cat would find enjoyable.  Being fractal in nature, the 
; dynamic cat duo thoroughly enjoyed their afternoon in the yard.  
; At one time, the cat from two doors down made a brief appearance 
; in the brush at the bottom of the yard.  I think he was just 
; trying to be friendly, but Tippy once again chased the other cat 
; back down where Tippy feels he belongs.  Today is once again 
; threatening rain.  Hopefully, the good luck will continue, and 
; the rain will hold off.  But there is no guarantee.  
; 
; Somehow, I got myself dragged into spending today looking at old 
; junk at one of the local antique emporiums, so the duo will have 
; to remain indoors until we return late this afternoon.  Until 
; next time, take care, and be ever more alert to signs of 
; fractals in the world around you.
