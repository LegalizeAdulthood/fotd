; FOTD -- May 06, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Returning to the parent fractal for May, which appeared on 
; May 3, we notice that the upper edge of the 'fan' is dotted with 
; bits and pieces of small Mandeloids and Mandeloid buds.  Today's 
; scene pictures a midget located in the most prominent valley of 
; the largest of these partially-obscured Mandeloids.
; 
; I named the image "A Golden Oldie".  I forget whether it was the 
; color that inspired the name, or if I gave it the name because 
; it gives me a feeling of olde tymes.  Most likely it was a com-
; bination of these things.
; 
; As the month progresses, I shall use nothing but the convention-
; al equal-iteration-band method to render and color the images.  
; There will be no 'evaporated' or 'tdis' images.  This limitation 
; will not result in boring images however.  The parent fractal 
; has nearly (and in fact, actual) unlimited variety.
; 
; When the time to rate the image arrived, I decided on an above-
; average 7.  I'm not exactly sure I like the mixture of green and 
; orange in the golden parts of the image.  But it's still a strik-
; ingly different scene, well worth the 7.
; 
; The parameter file renders the image in 16 minutes on my 
; machine.  The completed GIF image will download from the FOTD 
; web sites in a fraction of that time.  The URL of Paul's site 
; is:

; 
; The cats' good luck ended on Monday, as steady light rain moved 
; in on schedule shortly after lunch time.  The temperature of 48F 
; 9C was no help at all.  Confined as the duo were to the indoors, 
; their moods quickly soured, they grew testy, and a treat of tuna 
; was necessary to partially restore their good spirits.  For some 
; reason, Tippy tried to pick a fight with Thomas in the evening, 
; but Thomas, being the peaceful cat that he is, backed down grace-
; fully, and they both ended the day as good friends.
; 
; Today is cloudy and threatening rain again.  A totally peaceful 
; day among the dynamic duo might be too much to hope for, but we 
; shall see how it goes.  Until tomorrow, when we'll return to the 
; parent fractal for May, take care, and who knows what we don't 
; know about fractals.
