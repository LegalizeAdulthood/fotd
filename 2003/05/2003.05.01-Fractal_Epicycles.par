; FOTD -- May 01, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; This is the day, the day fractal fans have been waiting for with 
; bated, but not abated, breath -- the day the FOTD resumes its 
; one-a-day schedule.  And we start with a fractal that earns a 
; lofty rating of 8.  I named the image "Fractal Epicycles" for no 
; good reason.  I simply liked the sound of the title.
; 
; An epicycle is not an epihertz.  It is not an electronic wave at 
; all.  It is a revolution around a moving point.  Before men under-
; stood the true nature of the solar system, the retrograde loops 
; the planets trace in the sky when they are near opposition were 
; assumed to be a result of the planets circling a point that in 
; turn circled the earth.  As we discovered later, this is not so, 
; and epicycles fell from favor, eventually going the way of the 
; luminiferous aether.
; 
; Today's image is a zoom into the curiously symmetrical image 
; posted by Lee Skinner about 5 days ago.  I lowered the bailout 
; radius to 30, but left the other parameters unchanged.
; 
; In fractals generated from formulae that contain negative powers 
; of Z, the value given the bailout makes a huge difference in the 
; final appearance of the image.  Increasing the bailout causes 
; the elements to shrivel and break into separate pieces which 
; eventually shrink to nothing, leaving an image that consists 
; entirely of 'inside stuff'.  But even when the elements have 
; 'evaporated' the ghost of the original image can still be raised 
; by setting the inside fill to something like bof61.  This ghost 
; is sometimes the best version of the scene, though in today's 
; image it is too chaotic and far too slow.
; 
; Decreasing the bailout has the opposite effect.  The elements 
; increase in size until one expands to fill the entire screen, 
; resulting in an image of a single featureless color.  Using an 
; outside coloring method other than the standard equal-iteration-
; bands occasionally results in an interesting variation, though 
; this is the exception rather than the rule.
; 
; Today's image renders in a relatively modest 7-1/2 minutes on my 
; aging and overworked P200 machine, the one with the noisy 
; exhaust fan that needs a pep talk to make it start turning.  The 
; finished GIF image is available on the two FOTD web sites, which 
; have been slow lately, but will become more active now that the 
; daily FOTD is back.

; 
; The weather here at Fractal Central on Wednesday was fractal in 
; nature, as it always is.  The warm sun and temperature of 75F 
; 24C brought out the best in the fractal duo, who passed most of 
; the afternoon in the yard and on the porch, watching for 
; intruding cats.  At one time, the cat that lives three doors 
; down the hill thought of walking through the duo's yard.  His 
; thoughts were quickly laid to rest when Tippy leaped to the 
; attack position.  Thomas observed the goings on with interest, 
; presumably ready to run to help, (or more likely, for help), if 
; things got too far out of control.
; 
; Today is starting far less pleasantly, with lots of clouds, and 
; rain threatening.  On such days, the duo usually stays indoors, 
; while I try to finish the work that needs to be done.  And right 
; now, I have enough to be done to keep me busy most of the day, 
; so until next time, which will arrive in 24 hours, take care, 
; and if an infinity of other me's exist somewhere out there, what 
; practical difference does it make?  After all, I will never meet 
; them (or me).
