; FOTD -- May 30, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I should have realized it.
; 
; I see from the Fractint list that the 'bug' in the program is 
; not a bug at all, but actually a result of the multi-valued 
; nature of the complex log function.  It turns out that the 
; mirror images that result from switching the (p1) and (p2) 
; parameters in the MandelbrotMix formulas are both correct.  In 
; fact, an infinity of other 'correct' images could be drawn from 
; the same basic formula.
; 
; I have a formula in my collection named MandelbrotBC1, (BC 
; stands for branch cuts), which takes advantage of the multi-
; valued complex log function.  I have posted quite a few FOTD 
; images created by this formula.  I also have a formula hidden 
; somewhere which raises a complex exponent of Z to a power, then 
; extracts the same root.  Because of the two multi-valued steps, 
; the final image has little resemblance to the starting image.
; 
; Today's image is what I call a 'dry-lake', a term invented by 
; Lee Skinner, who first drew my attention to these features.  The 
; symmetry is there, but the midget at the center is not.  What 
; has happened is that the slice of today's image has passed very 
; close to a midget, but has not cut through it.  By changing the 
; (p4) parameter, the slice could be moved until it cuts the 
; now-invisible midget.  This is the reason I added the extra para-
; meter.  But finding the skimmed midget is not as easy as it 
; seems.  The C value changes along with the Z value, and, when 
; the (p4) parameter is changed, the center of the dry lake must 
; be chased as it moves off the screen.
; 
; Today's image lies in the north branch of the East Valley area 
; of the prominent Mandeloid feature located to the northeast of 
; the 'fan' of the parent fractal.  The elements in this area are 
; very skeletal, consisting largely of inside points, so to 
; produce a good picture, I set the inside to < atan > and let the 
; iterations add up.
; 
; The resulting image rates a 6 -- not bad, but with lots of room 
; for improvement.  The render time of 48 minutes could certainly 
; be improved, and this improvement may be gained by visiting 
; Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and downloading the image from there.
; 
; The forecast rain never appeared here at Fractal Central on 
; Thursday, and the temperature reached 75F 24C.  As a result, the 
; dynamic duo had an exceptional day in the outdoors.  They even 
; managed to stay out of trouble, (which isn't very difficult for 
; near-13-year-old cats).  Today is actually starting sunny, with 
; a forecast of sun all day.  It should be a good day for the cats.
; 
; For me, it will be a good day when the work is finished.  And in 
; order to finish, I must start.  So until next time, take care, 
; and beware of multiple values.
