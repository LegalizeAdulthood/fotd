; FOTD -- August 17, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to number 4 in my series if 12 MandNewt 
; formulae, all of which are based very loosely on the Ikenaga 
; function.  Like most images produced by these formulae, today's 
; consists largely of inside stuff, which in today's case, has 
; been brought to life by the 'zmag' inside fill.
; 
; I named the image, which resembles a scene on an alien world, 
; "The Supreme Mystery".  When I gave it the name, I had no parti-
; cular mystery in mind, so the viewers may take the image to mean 
; anything they choose.
; 
; The coloring is about as smooth as is possible to achieve with 
; fractals using the measly 256 colors of the GIF format.  It 
; raises the normally 6-rated image to a rating of 7.  The bottom 
; 1/4 of the image is almost total black, so be careful not to 
; save the image before it has finished generating.
; 
; The render time of 8 minutes is acceptable, though stretching 
; things a bit.  The most efficient way to view the mystery is to 
; download the completed GIF image from one of the FOTD web sites 
; at:

; 
; Saturday started threatening here at Fractal Central, and grew 
; more threatening as the day progressed.  The temperature reached 
; 88F 31C, then, just after 3pm, the first thunder-shower struck, 
; with a sudden burst of wind and rain that thoroughly soaked the 
; grass and put a quick end to the fractal cats' day in the yard.  
; Another storm, even heavier than the first, arrived after dark, 
; but by then the cats' moods were already sullen, and the rain 
; made little difference.  They ended the day sulking and eating 
; tuna.  My day was pleasant enough.  I enjoy storms. . . . and 
; fractals.
; 
; Today is starting much better.  There may be hope for happy 
; cats.  Until next FOTD, take care, and ponder the unspeakable 
; mysteries of life.
