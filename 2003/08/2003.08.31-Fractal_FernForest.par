; FOTD -- August 31, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Take 5/1000 part of Z^1000 and subtract Z from it before adding 
; C, and you get an empty circle with a circumference that 
; resembles a fine-tooth saw.  A very tiny valley exists where the 
; X-axis intersects the positive side of this saw-like border.  
; Today's scene is located in a spiral that lies on the southern 
; shore of this valley.
; 
; I have named the image "Fractal Fern-Forest".  One of the 
; earlier attempts at coloring gave the impression of a forest 
; floor covered with ferns.  I did not save the color map because 
; I wanted something better, but nothing better ever turned up, 
; and I am stuck with today's inferior color palette. Only the 
; name remains to indicate what might have been.  And the rating 
; of an average 5 reminds me to save color palettes that appear 
; all right but easy to improve upon.
; 
; All the detail in the image is natural high-iteration stuff.  
; The image is a totally traditional one, with a blank black 
; inside and an outside of equal-iteration bands.  When it comes 
; to fractals, I am a traditionalist.
; 
; When it comes to the philosophy of existence, I am a non-tradi-
; tionalist, but we will not go into that aspect at this time.  It 
; is time to post today's FOTD, which renders in 16 minutes.
; 
; The image can be viewed in far less time by downloading it from 
; the web sites of Paul or Scott at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Other than being rather warm, with a temperature of 93F 34C, 
; Saturday was a near perfect day here at Fractal Central.  The 
; weather experts were warning of rain all day, but their warnings 
; were another false alarm.  No rain fell to spoil the cats' sunny 
; afternoon in the yard.  When evening came, a cool north breeze 
; arose to comfortably end one of the best days the fractal duo 
; has had in several weeks.  And I saved a can of tuna.  Today 
; once again brings a forecast of rain.  It is starting partly 
; cloudy, but after all the empty warnings of yesterday, I feel 
; that a dry and comfortably cool day can be expected.  As is 
; apparent, I have little confidence in the ability of the weather 
; forecasters to accurately forecast weather.
; 
; The chance of the next FOTD appearing in 24 hours is 99.99 
; percent.  The chance it will rate higher than a 5 is 55 percent. 
; The chance I will have a good day is 80 percent.  The chance 
; that this is the end of today's FOTD is 100 percent.  Until next 
; time, take care, and if I could turn on precognition at will, I 
; would be the world's best forecaster.
