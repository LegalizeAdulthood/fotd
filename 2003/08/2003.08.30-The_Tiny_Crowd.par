; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I opened my e-mail box this morning, I noticed a message 
; with some real fractal substance in it from Osher Doctorow on 
; the Fractint list.  The message speculates that perhaps the 
; proper application of fractal geometry could clarify some of 
; the seemingly insoluable puzzles of modern physics.
; 
; I can't quite grasp how fractals could clarify things such as 
; quantum theory, but I have long watched and wondered how such a 
; revolutionary discovery as fractals could find so little 
; practical application and have so little impact on our under-
; standing of things.  It will be interesting to see where, if 
; anywhere, Osher's ideas go.
; 
; I am still browsing that old physics text book of mine, which 
; was published in the 1880's.  At the time, there were many 
; puzzles which have since been explained.  To begin, we were seen 
; living on a world hundreds of millions of years old, illuminated 
; by a sun that could have been burning for no more than ten-
; thousand years.  Then there was the problem of the Ether, which 
; everyone knew existed because waves need a medium in which to 
; propagate, but which was impossible to detect and needed to 
; possess some impossible qualities.  Finally, there was a very 
; puzzling situation with thermal radiation, which according to 
; classical physics should have been in the form of extreme ultra-
; violet radiation.
; 
; These problems were not solved until we went beyond classical 
; physics.  The discovery of nuclear energy solved the puzzle of 
; the generation of the sun's heat.  The theory of relativity made 
; the Luminiferous Ether unnecessary, and quantum theory explained 
; why hot coals glow orange-red instead of emitting gamma rays.
; 
; There are puzzles equally as perplexing in the world of physics 
; today.  Could fractals point the direction to the solution of 
; these puzzles?  Will fractals solve the puzzles, or better yet, 
; make them irrelevant?  And 120 years from now, will the idea of 
; quarks and superstrings be considered as quaint as the idea of 
; Luminiferous Ether seems today?
; 
; Today's fractal is another scene in the Z^3+C Mandeloid.  It is 
; located deep in the West Valley, which is a mirror of the East 
; Valley.  For a change, today's image was rendered with the out-
; side set to the 'fmod' option.  I named the image "The Tiny 
; Crowd" because it is filled with many cubic midgets.  The 
; rating is an average 5.
; 
; The 19-minute render time is slow, but speed may be found by 
; downloading the finished GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Friday here at Fractal Central was very warm and muggy, with a 
; temperature of 90F 32C and a dew point of 77F 25C.  A brief 
; shower in the afternoon cut short the cats' day in the yard 
; almost as soon as it started, leaving them sulky and making a 
; consolation treat of tuna and turkey necessary.  They ended the 
; day in resignation.
; 
; Today is starting warm and muggy again, but there is more sun 
; than yesterday at this time.  Whether this bodes good or evil 
; will not be determined until the day has ended.  In any case, I 
; shall return in 24 hours with another fractal, this one not in 
; the cubic M-set.
