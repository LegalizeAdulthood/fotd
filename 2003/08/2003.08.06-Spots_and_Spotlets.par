; FOTD -- August 06, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; At the end of yesterday's discussion I stated that today's image 
; would be a much better one.  Actually, today's image is another 
; perfectly average 5-rated one.  I apologize for any bitter 
; disappointment.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image was created by adding 0.018 
; part of Z^3 to Z^2, then adding 1/C instead of straight C, and 
; increasing the bailout radius to 40000.  It is a tiny Mandeloid, 
; barely visible at the center of the default screen, shaped like 
; a classic M-set with a greatly amplified negative stem.  Instead 
; of being a mere stick, the stem has broken apart into a new open 
; area shaped much like a Julia set.  But this area is not a Julia 
; set, because it has Mandeloid buds and midgets on its border.  
; One of the valleys holds today's scene.
; 
; When studying the image for a name, I noticed the multitude of 
; red-orange spots, and decided to name the image "Spots and 
; Spotlets".  The image is a pleasant one to view, especially on a 
; video-tube monitor in subdued light, even though it rates only 
; mediocre.
; 
; Perhaps the image's greatest drawback is the 21 minutes required 
; to render it from the attached parameter file.  But that draw-
; back can be avoided by downloading the finished GIF image from 
; Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The version of Fractint used by Scott on his site has been 
; recently having trouble correctly rendering the images created 
; with the 'Mystic2' formula.  However, today's image returns to 
; the 'MandelbrotMix4' formula, which has always worked properly, 
; so Scott's site will have the correct image.
; 
; A heavy thunder-shower at noon totally spoiled the cats' day 
; Monday here at Fractal Central.  When the sun appeared at 1pm, 
; the yard was a puddle of mud and the holly trees were dripping, 
; making it unfit for the delicate paws and ears of the dynamic 
; duo, who spent the afternoon sulking on the porch.  At least the 
; temperature of 81F 27C was within their comfort zone.  This 
; morning is actually starting sunny, but more heavy rain fell 
; during the night, and even more rain is forecast for this 
; afternoon.  Will things dry out in time for the duo to have a 
; pleasant day?  Find out in 24 hours, when the next FOTD will 
; appear.
; 
; Until then, take care, and pray for the rain to stop.
