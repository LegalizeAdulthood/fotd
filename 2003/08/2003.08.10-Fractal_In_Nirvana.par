; FOTD -- August 10, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Years ago there was a small deli restaurant in the Fractal 
; Central neighborhood, run by a Korean immigrant.  The merchant 
; has long since moved away, but I still remember the conversa-
; tions he and I used to have on slow days.
; 
; He was a Buddhist who was eager to talk about religion, particu-
; larly his idea of Buddhism.  He often told me that the goal of 
; Buddhists is to escape the constant reincarnations on earth and 
; enter Nirvana.  He expressed amusement at the simplicity of our 
; two main western beliefs -- that we go to heaven when we die, to 
; be perfectly happy for all eternity, or that we simply cease to 
; exist, eliminating the need to concern ourselves with the topic.
; 
; When I asked him to describe the Nirvana that Buddhists believe 
; in, he told me that it is hard to put into words, but that 
; Nirvana is like a mixture of heaven and non-existence.  We cease 
; to exist when we enter Nirvana, which is the ultimate peace, yet 
; somehow we can enjoy the ultimate peace of not existing.  When I 
; asked him what it is that does the enjoying, he simply shrugged 
; and said that one must enter Nirvana before they can understand 
; it.  Nirvana is an oxymoron.
; 
; Today's image is also an oxymoron.  It consists of as much 
; inside material as outside material, yet it is impossible to 
; tell one from the other.  I named it "A Fractal in Nirvana" when 
; the etheric blues reminded me of the conversations about 
; transcendental things that I once had at that small restaurant.
; 
; The parent fractal is the same as the parent of yesterday's 
; 'Wonderland' image, though instead of going to 'East valley' to 
; explore, I went to one of the numerous tiny valleys on the west 
; shore of the main bay.  The 'inside' parts of the image have 
; been made visible by the 'bof60' inside fill.  This fill 
; normally creates mostly bubbles, though the bubbles are not very 
; apparent in today's image.
; 
; The image is notably better that yesterday's hasty achievement, 
; and IMO rates an honest 7.  And the 9-minute render time allows 
; ample time to ponder the mysteries of the beyond.
; 
; Those more concerned with the here and the now may bypass the 
; pondering by downloading the completed GIF image from Paul's web 
; site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The rain on Saturday amounted to only a few sprinkles here at 
; Fractal Central, but even that was enough to wet the grass and 
; dampen the spirits of the dynamic duo.  Due to the high humid-
; ity, the temperature of 80F 27C felt more like 90F 32C.  I have 
; little hope for improvement, because today promises to be more 
; of the same.
; 
; For the cats, the day will be questionable.  For me it's going 
; to be a lazy day -- that is if I can get through it without 
; finding any work that needs to be done.  Until next FOTD, take 
; care, and walk in the peace of eternal fractal oneness.
