; FOTD -- August 02, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; This discussion will have to be brief.  We have unexpected work 
; waiting to be done here at F.C. and a customer who wants his job 
; before he brings in the material.
; 
; Some fractals simply defy logic.  Today's image, which was 
; created by the 'Mystic2' formula, is one of these.  It has more 
; themes than a Mexican TV-novella, any one of which could have 
; served as the basis for a fractal.  (Any theme, that is.  I 
; don't think I've ever seen a fractal based on a soap-opera.)
; 
; There is so much that could be discussed in today's image that 
; discussion is nearly useless.  The only thing to do is to study 
; the image, sit back and mutter, "Oh my!".  The image is so mixed 
; up in fact that it almost appears to have been constructed by 
; hand from many different fractals.
; 
; The image certainly is something new, which is why I named it 
; "Neo-Fractal".  I think that the mixture of unrelated themes 
; actually goes too far, and this holds the rating to an average 5.
; 
; The render time of 4 minutes can be avoided by downloading the 
; finished image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Friday was cloudy and exceptionally humid here at Fractal 
; Central.  The temperature of 81F 27C was fair enough, but a 
; two-hour period of light rain in the afternoon spoiled the cats' 
; day in the yard.  A treat of tuna was needed to restore their 
; good moods.
; 
; Today promises to be more of the same.  I expect the same 
; response from the dynamic duo.  In 24 hours I shall return with 
; the next fractal.  Until then, take care, and when searching for 
; truth, be sure you recognize it when you find it.
