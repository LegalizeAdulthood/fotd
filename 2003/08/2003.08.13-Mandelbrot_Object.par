; FOTD -- August 13, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; While assembling the parameter section of today's FOTD, I 
; noticed my humble MandelbrotN formula.  I saw all four lines of 
; it -- about as short and simple a formula that could produce a 
; fractal.  Then I brought up Albrecht's latest Multifractal 
; formula -- a work of fractal-programming genius, a mini-program 
; with hundreds of lines that took many days of labor to develop, 
; and still may not be finished.
; 
; The two formulas illustrate two different approaches to the art 
; of fractaling.  I find my fractals; Albrecht creates his.  Which 
; method is the better way of working with fractals?  Asking such 
; a question is like asking whether fractals are art.  It is up to 
; each individual to decide.
; 
; In my long fractal career I have written thousands of short, 
; simple formulas, most of which took less that 1/2 hour to 
; complete and have long since been filed away and forgotten.  I 
; could never imagine myself working weeks or months on a single 
; formula, even if I did have a clear idea of where I was going.  
; But why should I need to, when nearly every fractal created by 
; every formula contains infinite surprises?
; 
; Today's image rates an 8.  One point of this rating is due to 
; the surprising nature of the image.  Until I found it, I had 
; assumed that the near-perfect rectangles such as I used to 
; create yesterday's 'Space Station' image exist only in the Julia 
; plane of the Z^2.003+C Mandeloid.  I should have known better.
; 
; Yesterday, while searching the area of the Julia rectangle in 
; the Mandelbrot direction, I found many small figures like the 
; larger Julia figure that holds the rectangle.  I found no 
; midgets, but most surprising, I found that the small figures 
; hold near-perfect empty rectangles where the arms branch out.  
; To see some empty rectangles in their natural surroundings, 
; toggle today's image of one of these small figures in and out of 
; color-cycling mode and watch for the areas that blink.
; 
; Clearly, I have much more exploring to do in this area.  To 
; begin, I must find those elusive Mandelbrot midgets.  And if the 
; figures with their rectangles are present in both the Julia and 
; Mandelbrot directions, they should be present in the odd and 
; oblique Julibrot directions also.
; 
; I gave little thought to the naming of the image.  "Mandelbrot 
; Object" was as good a name as I could come up with.  But the 
; name is a perfect description of the surprising nature of the 
; scene.
; 
; The render time of 15 minutes is starting to border on the 
; excessive.  Relief in the form of the completed GIF image is 
; available on the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Tuesday was actually a pleasant day here at Fractal Central.  
; The temperature reached 86F 30C, the humidity was bearable, and 
; the heavy rain storms that broke out in the afternoon stayed 
; well west of us, leaving the F.C. area with a partly cloudy day 
; and happy cats.
; 
; If tomorrow's FOTD is as surprising as today's, I'll be happy.  
; If it's not, I'll still be happy.  Until next time, take care, 
; and life is just a happy procession of fractals.
