; FOTD -- August 12, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I try to convince myself that the public media is a fair and 
; unbiased source of information, but it is becoming very hard to 
; keep up the self-delusion.  Every time I turn on the fractal TV, 
; it seems I see dramatic fear-inspiring stories of record-
; breaking heat, drought, and fires in Europe and the western U.S. 
; The assumption is that global warming has arrived, and we are 
; ready to run out of water and be wiped out by heat exhaustion, 
; wildfires, flooded coastal cities, and mass starvation.
; 
; But where are the stories about the ongoing record-breaking 
; cool, rainy summer in the Eastern part of the U.S., or the cold 
; wave in Europe this past April, or the current record-cold 
; weather in Australia?  And finally, why are most professional 
; meteorologists more concerned about an ice age than global 
; warming?
; 
; Those living in the Fractal Central area are already more 
; worried about the next ice age than global warming.  The local 
; farmers (in addition to the local cats) are actually praying for 
; dry weather.  Yesterday was the 22nd consecutive day with at 
; least some rain here at F.C.
; 
; While I have been searching for an unbiased news source, I have 
; also been searching for fractals.  For today's image I returned 
; to my favorite fractal rectangle -- the one in the Z^(2.003)+C 
; Julia set at C=-1.7435,0.0 and Z=0.00019,0.07388.
; 
; This object is shaped like a rectangle only when sliced in the 
; Julia direction.  Any deviation from that direction quickly 
; distorts the rectangle.  In today's image, we deviate only one 
; degree toward the Parabolic direction, but even that small 
; deviation turns the rectangle into a kind of table-top sitting 
; on a platform, creating a convenient landing place for a space 
; ship.  I have named the image "Space Station".
; 
; The image needed a little help to reveal its full potential.  
; The surface of the table top, as well as most of the platform 
; consist of inside material made visible by the 'fmod' option.  
; When this was done, the result was an image worthy of a rating 
; of 7.
; 
; Changing the imag(p1) parameter even slightly totally changes 
; the image.  If imag(p1) is reduced to 80, the effect is more of 
; a cut-away view of a volcano.  When the parameter is reduced 
; beyond that, the image stretches horizontally until, by the time 
; the Parabolic direction is reached, it becomes little more 
; than a series of horizontal bands.
; 
; Four minutes is a fast-enough time for the attached parameter 
; file.  And as always, the completely finished image is available 
; in good old-fashioned GIF format on the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather on Monday here at Fractal Central would have been 
; near perfect if a heavy thunder-shower had not arrived and 
; dropped 0.8 inches or 2cm of rain just as the dynamic duo were 
; finishing their near-perfect day in the yard.  Had it not been 
; for the rain, the temperature of 81F 27C would have been ideal.  
; The rain did one good thing however -- it hurried the duo 
; indoors without urging from me.  When they were safely inside, I 
; gave them a small treat of tuna to assure their continued good 
; moods.
; 
; Today is scheduled to be a repeat.  Things will be all right if 
; the rain holds off until 5pm.  I'll be all right if the work 
; goes smoothly and the next fractal is a good one.  Until that 
; next fractal arrives, take care, and where is the heat one 
; expects in this part of the world at this time of year?
