; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have on my book shelf a 115 year-old text book on the princi-
; ples of physics, which I found in my father's house a few weeks 
; after he died.  I'm not sure how he came upon the book.  Most 
; likely, he got it from his father.  But it is one of my favorite 
; books to open and browse when I find a few minutes with nothing 
; else to do.
; 
; The book is fun to read for several reasons.  To start, it is 
; interesting to see the accepted beliefs of the 1880's as they 
; were actually taught at the time, and not as they are described 
; by present day writers.  Five forms of matter are described -- 
; solid, liquid, gaseous, ultragaseous, (now called plasma), and 
; Etheric.  The Luminiferous Ether was still assumed to be the 
; transmission medium of light, but its existence was not naively 
; accepted without question.  On almost every page of the chapter 
; on 'Ether waves' a new puzzle is mentioned.  Experiments are 
; pointed out that contradict both other experiments and observa-
; tion.  The problem of the nature of the Ether was considered, as 
; the book states, 'the most recondite in physics'.
; 
; But perhaps what draws me most strongly to the book is the sense 
; of wonder it imparts to simple experiments that today are taken 
; for granted even in high-school physics labs.  The 19th century 
; was an age of enthusiasm and discovery.  This sense of wonder 
; reminds me of the sense of wonder that surrounded the discovery 
; of fractals, and then all too soon vanished as people grew bored 
; with pretty pictures and turned to more practical things.
; 
; Today's not-too-practical image is another scene in the Z^3+C 
; Mandeloid.  It pictures a cubical midget very close to the north-
; west shore of the north bay of its parent, in an area where the 
; tendrils have become quite jagged.  This is an area where Siegel 
; Disks are found in the corresponding Julia sets, though I doubt 
; that I would know a Siegel Disk if I saw one.
; 
; After a few minutes thought, I named the image "Mission 
; Cubical".  Since there is nothing really out of the ordinary 
; about the image, I could rate it at only a perfectly average 5.  
; The render time of 6 minutes is not too slow, but a more 
; convenient way of viewing the image is to download it from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Thursday was as pleasant a day as might be expected in this part 
; of the world at this time of year.  The mostly sunny skies, 
; temperature of 88F 31C and moderate humidity allowed the cats to 
; have a satisfying romp in the yard.  And while they were 
; romping, I finished the graphic work without incident.  If only 
; all days could be as uneventful . . .
; 
; But today is starting cloudy with rain forecast, meaning it is 
; unlikely that the day will be as pleasant as yesterday.  We 
; won't know for sure until the day has ended however.  To see 
; exactly how things work out, check back here in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and be fractally correct in everything you do.
