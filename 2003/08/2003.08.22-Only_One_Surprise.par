; FOTD -- August 22, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I heard two interesting rumors yesterday.  Rumor number 1 is 
; that Microsoft is using Linux!!! on its web servers to protect 
; them from worms and hacker attacks.  Rumor number 2 is that the 
; world of fractals is filled with surprises.
; 
; I don't know about rumor number 1, but rumor 2 is certainly 
; correct.  I have discovered many surprising things in the 16 or 
; so years I have been exploring the fractal world.  Fractal 
; trees, one of which appears in today's image, are only one of 
; these surprises.
; 
; The trees lurk in and near the Julia sets of the Julibrots with 
; an exponent of Z between 1 and 2.  The orientation of today's 
; image lies 0.65 degree from the Julia direction, and the expo-
; nent is 1.5, making the conditions perfect for the generation of 
; fractal trees.
; 
; Since the 'tree' in today's image is but one of an infinity of 
; similar trees in the vicinity, I named the image "Only One 
; Surprise".  I rated the final result at a 6, which is just 
; slightly above average.
; 
; BTW, perhaps the greatest fractal surprise of all came when I 
; discovered that there are two ways in which the Z^2+C Julibrot 
; can be sliced to give a perfect Mandelbrot set, and the second 
; M-set has twice the area of the more familiar classic set.  But 
; that's a story for another day.
; 
; Right now, it's time to give the good news that today's image 
; renders in less than 3 minutes from the parameter file, and the 
; equally good news that the finished GIF image is available on 
; the W.W.Web at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Typical summer heat and humidity with ample sun and a tempera-
; ture of 90F 32C gave the fractal duo a pleasant day Thursday in 
; the shadier parts of the yard.  By the time the end of the day 
; came, they had worn themselves out, and came indoors to eat with 
; no coaxing.  Today promises to be a repeat, with the chance of 
; showers added.  We'll see how it goes.
; 
; It will go well for me if I finish the day's work without any 
; unexpected problems.  (Such as a call complaining that I sent a 
; job in CMYK instead of grey scale, from a customer who for some 
; reason could not convert the file.)  Regardless of any problems, 
; I shall return in 24 hours with more fractal goodies and a few 
; words of wisdom.  Until then, take care, and be advised that one 
; person's wisdom can be another person's kookiness.
