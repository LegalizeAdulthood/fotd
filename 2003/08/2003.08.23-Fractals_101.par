; FOTD -- August 23, 2003 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It was a bad day Friday here at Fractal Central, with a broken 
; air-conditioner and complaining customers.  I finally got the 
; work problems behind me in the evening, though it was nature 
; that supplied the cool air.  Unfortunately, the letter from the 
; fracprogrammers list appeared with its 'you have been unsub-
; scribed' notice at exactly the right moment to act as the target 
; for the frustration that had been building all day.
; 
; After my outburst, I settled down and found a fractal.  I looked 
; exactly where someone just beginning their exploration in the 
; world of fractals might look -- along the main stem of the 
; Mandelbrot set, deep in the East Valley of the large midget.  I 
; did make a slight change however -- I double rotated the scene 
; 45 degrees before starting my exploration.
; 
; Surprisingly, the rotation makes little difference in the image 
; that appears on the screen, though the larger midget in whose 
; East Valley it appears, as well as the appearance of the M-set 
; itself, have been totally changed.
; 
; I named the image "Fractals-101", since such images serve as an 
; introduction to the world of fractals.  The rating of a below-
; average 3 might be a bit harsh, but I'm disappointed with myself 
; for blasting the list administrator, who is probably not respon-
; sible for sending the notice, and I feel I deserve no better a 
; rating.
; 
; There is certainly nothing lacking with the render time, which 
; at less than 1-1/2 minutes is probably less time than it will 
; take to download the completed GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Friday, with a temperature of 95F 35C, was very hot and humid 
; here at Fractal Center, especially indoors when the cool air 
; stopped working.  In the evening, a spectacular but harmless 
; rain and lightning storm arose and cooled things down to 70F 
; 21C.  The fractal cats spent the entire afternoon outdoors, 
; lurking in the shade of the holly trees, and venturing inside 
; only when the thunder began.  They must have sensed my bad mood.
; 
; Today promises to be much better.  My mood can be only better.  
; The next FOTD, which should also be better, will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and hope for the best.
