; FOTD -- August 28, 2003 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; This morning, after clearing my e-mail box of the countless 
; (that is 147) spams, viruses, and returned messages that I never 
; sent out, I found three real messages.  One is from a known 
; customer who wanted to make a small change in a job I will be 
; working on later today.  The second is an unsubscribe request 
; from a member of the fractint list.  The third is a reply to the 
; second letter, echoing the unsubscribe request.  Since posting a 
; letter to the list and requesting to be unsubscribed is not the 
; proper way to unsubscribe, I feel these two letters were 
; intended to send a message.  And the message is "we're tired of 
; all this off-topic blather. Where has the interest in fractals 
; gone"?
; 
; I often wonder this same thing myself.  When, except for the 
; FOTD, the list is blank for days, when a fractal enthusiast 
; devotes weeks of effort writing and refining a great fractal 
; formula, and, except for a few courtesy fractals, the list 
; members basically ignore it, the message I get is, "we're bored 
; with fractals.  Let's move on to something else."  Then, when we 
; start bickering over things such as internet spam and precogni-
; tion, topics that I myself introduced, the message becomes even 
; stronger.  Maybe we're all bored with fractals.  Maybe the 
; fractal thing has run its course.
; 
; True, over on the UF list, the messages keep pouring in.  But 
; the attitude on that list is more 'hey look, I'm an artist' 
; rather than 'hey look at what these numbers do', which was the 
; attitude when I discovered fractals those many years ago.
; 
; And yes, perhaps boredom is catching.  I must admit that after 
; so many years of one new fractal after another, even I find my 
; enthusiasm not quite what it once was.  Perhaps this is the 
; reason I was so irritated when I was unsubscribed from the frac-
; programmers list, which I was hardly aware I was subscribed to.
; 
; I am not on the verge of giving up on fractals however.  I'll 
; keep the FOTD going for the immediate future, and despite broken 
; promises in the past, I soon will post pictures of the fractal 
; cats, who some might believe are imaginary.  And that long 
; promised but never delivered FOTD-CD will be ready as soon as I 
; gather the determination to finish it.  Now on to today's 
; glorious fractal.
; 
; Today's image is simply a different view of the cubic midget 
; that appeared in yesterday's image.  It is not a Mandelbrot 
; image; it is not a Julia image.  Its orientation lies halfway 
; through the double rotation between the parabolic and rectangu-
; lar directions, therefore it is a random oblique slice of the 
; Z^3+C Julibrot.
; 
; I named the image "Dog-Bone" because of the bone-shaped area 
; surrounding the hole at the center.  I rated it a 4 because I am 
; not quite satisfied with the final result.  The render time of 
; 19 minutes may be avoided by downloading the completed GIF image 
; from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:

; 
; Wednesday here at Fractal Central was a repeat of the day 
; before.  Blue skies in the morning gave way to a period of light 
; rain at midday, followed by hot sun in the afternoon and 
; concluding with a heavy thunder-storm at 7pm.  The temperature 
; of 84F 29C was near ideal, but the wet grass kept the dynamic 
; duo confined indoors for most of the day.  A tuna treat was once 
; again needed to bring their bad day to an almost-successful 
; conclusion.
; 
; I do not yet know how my day will go.  There is ample work to 
; keep me busy until late afternoon, and unlimited fractals to 
; keep me busy when that work ends.  But there is also the 
; unexpected, which could happen at any time, so check back in 24 
; hours to see how things turn out.  Until next time, take care, 
; and keep the fractal faith.
