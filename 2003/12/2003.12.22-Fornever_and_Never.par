; FOTD -- December 22, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I first came upon today's image, I rated it a 4, and almost 
; decided to relegate it to the trash-bin of forgotten fractals 
; that never made FOTD.  But before deleting it, I tried a few 
; thumbnail images of the same scene, using the various outside 
; options.  Most options produced little more than total chaos, 
; but the 'tdis' and especially the 'fmod' options created interes-
; ting miniatures.  I chose the 'fmod' option.
; 
; The resulting image consists of the overlapping bubbles that 
; appear so often with the 'fmod' option.  Some bubbles are nearly 
; circular, while others are peanut-shaped.  All the bubbles put 
; together create an image with an unusually vivid three-dimen-
; sional effect.  And the traditional Mandelbrot midget is right 
; where it belongs, at the center of the frame.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image, which was created by 
; combining various negative portions of Z^3 and Z^5, appears to 
; the visual sense as a Mandeloid rotated -90 degrees, with more 
; extra bays and valley than one can shake an iteration at.  The 
; scene of the image lies in a supernumerary valley on the south-
; west shore of a smaller Mandeloid located on the main (negative-
; imaginary in this case) stem of the large Mandeloid.
; 
; The rating of an exceptional 8 might be a bit overdone.  I 
; really did not give the image the attention to the coloring that 
; a truly exceptional fractal should have.
; 
; When I named the image "Fornever and Never", I had a reason.  
; Unfortunately, I have now forgotten that reason.  But it's an 
; interesting name for an interesting fractal.  And the waiting 
; time of 10 minutes can be eliminated by downloading the comple-
; ted GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Saturday and Sunday were sunny but chilly days here at Fractal 
; Central, with the temperature in the 30'sF, around 2C.  The cats 
; spent only a short time outdoors on both days.  The rest of the 
; time they spent stretched on their blanket by the large radiator 
; in the living room.  The tuna kept them happy when the rest of 
; the world turned bleak.  Today promises to be much milder.  The 
; fractal cats deserve the break.
; 
; For me, it's work before fun.  Until the next FOTD appears, most 
; likely but not certainly 24 hours from now, take care, and watch 
; your fractal language.
