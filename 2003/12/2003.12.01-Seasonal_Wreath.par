; FOTD -- December 01, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Like so much of our current view of reality, fractals are non-
; intuitive.  Before the theory of relativity, who could have 
; thought that matter is a different form of energy, that electro-
; magnetic waves are transmitted by nothing, or that the present 
; moment of time is not universal but unique to the individual 
; observer?  Before the quantum theory, who could have guessed 
; that photons and electrons are incomprehensible things that can 
; be seen as either waves or particles; or that, with a proper 
; experimental set-up, it is apparently possible to change the 
; past; or that the closest we can come to reality at the quantum 
; level is the mathematical equations which describe it?  Before 
; fractals were discovered, who could have guessed that an expres-
; sion as simple as Z^2+C could lead to infinity?
; 
; The world extends far beyond the part of it comprehended by an 
; ant.  It extends far beyond the part of it comprehended by the 
; fractal cats.  These lower forms of life (the cats would dis-
; agree here) lack the intelligence to grasp the vastness of exis-
; tence.  But then there is man.  Is our intelligence the highest 
; form of intelligence possible?  Is it sufficient to grasp the 
; totality of existence?  Apparently not.
; 
; One-hundred years ago, we assumed that our local galaxy com-
; prised the entire universe.  Then the telescope at the Mount 
; Wilson observatory showed that we were hugely underestimating 
; the vastness of the universe.  In recent years we have been pon-
; dering an infinity of parallel universes combined into an infi-
; nitely more vast multiverse.  Next, we might be thinking of an 
; infinity of multiverses.  And there are those 11 dimensions (up 
; from 10) required for M-theory to make sense.
; 
; How can we find a 'theory of everything' when our concept of 
; 'everything' keeps growing?  I sometimes feel that, due to the 
; limitations of out intellectual apparatus, we are even today 
; unaware of as much of existence as an ant going mechanically 
; about its programmed chores.  And artificial intelligence can be 
; of little help, for we will design our computers to 'think' as 
; much like ourselves as possible.  If a computer actually were to 
; start thinking in a truly new and original manner, we would 
; likely fail to comprehend its unfamiliar logic, and assume it 
; was malfunctioning.  We would re-program it to 'think' more like 
; ourselves.
; 
; It is kind of discouraging.  We are nearing the limits, and the 
; limits are ourselves.  120 years ago, we thought we had discov-
; ered almost all there was to know; today it looks like we don't 
; even know what we don't know, and even worse, because of our 
; limited minds, we never will know.
; 
; Oh, before I forget -- we have a fractal today.  It is an 'evap-
; orated' scene in the fractal created by a whimsical formula of 
; 1's and 4's based on the square root of 2.  I named it "Seasonal 
; Wreath" because it reminds me of the wreaths that decorate so 
; many doors and windows at this time of year.
; 
; I rated the image at an exceptional 8, which might be a bit 
; liberal.  But after almost three weeks of Mandelbrot images, it 
; seems like a refreshing change.  The render time of two minutes 
; is well within reason, even though a download of the completed 
; image might be a bit faster.  That download may be found on 
; Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and on Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Sunday turned out to be another near-average day here at Fractal 
; Central, a bland day, slightly chilly, with little to tell 
; about.  The partly cloudy skies and temperature of 48F 14C were 
; barely acceptable to the cats, who were outdoors only an hour.  
; Their spirits were lightened, however, by the last of the left-
; over turkey.
; 
; This morning is starting mild with promises of a pleasant day.  
; But a cold front with high winds is due around midday.  The cats 
; dislike wind and cold, so we'll have to hope for the best for 
; them.  Until tomorrow, take care, and take life one fractal at 
; a time.
