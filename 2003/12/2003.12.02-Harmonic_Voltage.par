; FOTD -- December 02, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have never learned to appreciate 'New Age' music.  With a few 
; exceptions, the genre seems to be 'over my head' (or maybe 
; beneath me).  And this is strange, because I most certainly do 
; appreciate the traditional 'classical' music, which is approach-
; ing the verge of extinction, at least here in the USA.  When 
; hearing New Age music, I am inevitably struck by the way it 
; appears to drone on and on in abject monotony.  It sounds good 
; for a minute or two but nothing interesting ever develops.
; 
; Yet some people I speak to are enthralled by this music.  They 
; tell me it is the best thing to come along since music was 
; invented.  New Age music concerts are very well attended.  Why 
; then do I get nothing from it?
; 
; Either the music is empty of meaning or it is filled with 
; meaning which I cannot recognize.  Most likely the truth, if an 
; absolute truth exists, lies somewhere between these extremes.  
; The experience of appreciating music is a co-operative effort 
; shared by composer and listener.  The composer places the seeds 
; of enjoyment in his work, but it is up to the listener to supply 
; the environment in which these might germinate into enjoyment.  
; If a work lacks the seeds, it will quickly be forgotten.  If a 
; listener lacks the fertile soil in which a particular type of 
; seeds might grow, the work will have no effect on him.  I guess 
; I'm in the latter class as far as 'New Age' music goes.
; 
; Now what does this venture into music appreciation have to do 
; with fractals?  Well, the name of today's striking image from 
; the M-Mix4 formula is "Harmonic Voltage", a title I borrowed 
; from a computer-animation music video I saw recently on local 
; TV.  The visual part of the video was IMO spectacular, but the 
; music that accompanied the animation was IMO bland to say the 
; least.  Surely, I thought, such spectacular images must inspire 
; or be inspired by better music than this.  Curiously enough, the 
; fractal lady enjoyed the music but said 'ho-hum' to the visuals. 
; I guess it's all in the mind of the beholder, much as some phil-
; osophers claim the entire real world is.
; 
; Oh by the way, I really like today's image, which I have rated 
; at an exceptional 8.  The sinuous flames radiating from the 
; central midget were produced by rendering the formula with the 
; outside set to the 'tdis' option.  One final note -- I wonder 
; what today's scene would look like if it were 'evaporated'.
; 
; To enjoy the image, run the included parameter file or download 
; the image from one of the two FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Monday was partly cloudy and chilly, with a temperature of 50F 
; 10C and the strong winds that the cats dislike.  The duo spent 
; most of the afternoon sitting by the window, watching the wind 
; in the trees and the birds soaring by.  They ventured outside 
; for only a few minutes.  Their moods were unusually bright for 
; a day of confinement however, and no tuna was needed.
; 
; Today promises to be similar, but even colder.  It remains to be 
; seen how the duo will react.  My reaction will be satisfaction 
; when the bit of work now on the shelf is finished.  Until next 
; FOTD, take care, and enjoy yourself.
