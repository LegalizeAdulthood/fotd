; FOTD -- December 30, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today is the next-to-last day of the year 2003 here at Fractal 
; Central, (and everywhere else as well), and there is a bit of 
; work I want to put behind me before the year changes.  Today's 
; discussion will therefore be short and to the point.
; 
; The image is a scene in the fractal that results when 0.3 parts 
; of Z^(-9.5) are combined with 3 parts of Z^(-1.5) and (1/C) is 
; added.  The parent fractal is one of those disorganized, 
; rambling things that results when negative powers of Z are 
; combined.
; 
; Today's image is as much a demonstration of the program features 
; as a discovery of a new fractal.  I have rendered the image with 
; the outside set to 'fmod' and the inside set to 'bof61'.  I 
; normally prefer to avoid program trickery, but in today's case, 
; using the available features results in a more interesting image. 
; The image as it is, rates a 6.  When rendered in the normal 
; manner, the image rates only a 4.  The two extra rating points 
; were IMO worth the departure from fractal purity.
; 
; Something about the image reminds me of fish.  I therefore named 
; it "Something Fishier", though I can see really nothing in the 
; picture that could be associated with fish.
; 
; The render time of 27 minutes is slow, but can be avoided by 
; downloading the finished GIF image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Monday was quite pleasant here at Fractal Central.  The sky was 
; mostly sunny, the temperature reached 54F 12C, the wind was 
; light, and the cats were happy.  Today started wet, but the rain 
; moved out quickly and the sun is now appearing.  I expect the 
; cats will be happy again.
; 
; The next FOTD, the last for 2003, is already in the works, and 
; will appear right here in about 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and keep looking for fractals.
