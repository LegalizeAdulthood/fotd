; FOTD -- December 07, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a dynamic one -- an image of a midget in the 
; Z^1.09+C Mandeloid, which has been sliced 96 turns up the 
; hyperspatial logarithmic spiral.  It is incredible that a midget 
; could be found in a fractal with an exponent as close to unity 
; as 1.09, but today's image does not lie.  The midget is there 
; for all the world to see.
; 
; But it doesn't look like a midget.  It looks more like a comet 
; tearing through the solar ejecta, complete with coma and tail.  
; This appearance reflects the shape of its oversized parent 
; fractal.
; 
; I could have named the picture something like 'N.E.O.' or 'Solar 
; Wind', but before giving the image a name, I looked more closely 
; and noticed in the comet's tail an object that vaguely resembles 
; a scorpion.  I named the image "Scorpio the Scorpion", which is 
; the name assigned the constellation in the southern sky that 
; resembles a scorpion.
; 
; Scorpio is also a sign of the zodiac, and one of the 12 signs 
; of Astrology.  Do I believe in Astrology?  Yes, the study known 
; as Astrology most certainly does exist.  Do I believe that the 
; science, (or pseudoscience), of Astrology has any truth behind 
; it?  That is a much harder question to answer.  Astrologers 
; certainly do believe that Astrology is a valid study, or they 
; would have discovered its uselessness long ago, and it would 
; have died.  (Of course, they could be charlatans, preying on the 
; gullible.)  Skeptical scientists certainly are convinced that 
; Astrology is a waste of time and effort, for they know of no 
; possible way the position of the heavenly bodies could affect 
; the character and fate of a person on earth.
; 
; IMO, the question is not quite decided.  I assume the validity 
; of Astrology is greatly overblown, but is it zero?  A little 
; more than wish fulfillment would appear to be necessary to keep 
; Astrology alive and apparently well for these thousands of 
; years.  I look at the clock on the wall above my desk and see 
; that there is a correspondence between the position of the hands 
; and the position of the sun in the sky.  Every evening, when the 
; hour hand reaches six, night falls.  The hour hand does not 
; affect the sun, yet the correspondence does exist.  Does some 
; similar correspondence exist that could give Astrology a modicum 
; of validity without the need for the heavenly bodies to exert an 
; effect on a person on earth?  Almost but not absolutely certain-
; ly, it does not.
; 
; Well, I've been reading 'Skeptical Inquirer', a magazine that 
; always makes me pause to ponder, and I find myself once again 
; drifting from the fractal topic.  Today's image rates a 6, the 
; most common rating of the FOTD's.  Its render time is just under 
; 9 minutes on my machine.  This time is a bit slow, and may be 
; cut by more than half by downloading the completed GIF image 
; from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>

; 
; The snow ended by noon on Saturday, followed in the afternoon by 
; some sun, but the damage had already been done.  Even though the 
; temperature rose to just above freezing, the ground was covered 
; by deep snow, which confined the fractal cats to the freshly-
; swept porch.  Deprived of their outing, the cats fell into 
; sullen moods, which were lightened only when the tuna appeared.  
; Today looks to be just as cold, and the snow is still out there. 
; I suppose the cats will need more tuna.
; 
; I plan on doing as little as possible for the rest of the day.  
; Check back in 24 hours to see if I succeed.  Until then, take 
; care, and be happy in your leisure.
