; 
; FOTD -- December 14, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal scene lies in the not-quite-imaginary land that 
; is created when 1.3 parts of Z^(0.92) are subtracted from 1.3 
; parts of Z^(-1.08) and (1/C) is added instead of straight C.  
; This parent fractal appears to the sense of sight as a twisted, 
; stretched, pinched-off Mandeloid with a large bud on the north-
; west shore of the main bay.  This large bud might or might not 
; be the period-2 bud.  I did not check.
; 
; The shoreline of this large bud is crowded by unusually plenti-
; ful and unusually small sub-buds, each bud with a band of chaos 
; stretching out and terminating in a flat disk.  Today's scene is 
; located near the terminal point of one of these bands of chaos 
; on the west shore of the large bud.
; 
; When rendered using the normal equal-iteration method, today's 
; image is pretty boring, but the 'tdis' option (I should use this 
; option more often) really brings it to life, giving the whole 
; thing a kind of art-nouveau appearance, reminiscent of the turn 
; of the 20th century.  And curiously enough, the scene maintains 
; its attractiveness when zoomed both into and out of.  This trend 
; could continue forever, which is why I named the image "Forever 
; Fractal".
; 
; When rating time arrived, I decided on a 7.  It's an above-
; average scene, at least by my standards.  And the render time of 
; just over 5 minutes on my tired old machine is bearably short, 
; at least for a Sunday, when many have nothing to do but watch 
; the TV.
; 
; Those who would rather not miss 5 minutes of that game may down-
; load the completed GIF image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;        <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The promised philosophy is already written, and will appear in 
; tomorrow's philofractal version of the FOTD.
; 
; Friday and Saturday were chilly here at Fractal Central, with 
; temperatures both days just above freezing.  But there was just 
; enough sun to make outdoor life bearable for the fractal duo, 
; who spent just enough time outdoors to prevent cat boredom.  
; However, today started with heavy snow, which is just now 
; changing to rain.  I fear the worst moods might be in store for 
; Thomas and Tippy.
; 
; For me, the worst has been avoided.  By working all day 
; Saturday, I avoided the work back-up that was threatening.  But 
; there is still a bit of work to be cleared away before Monday, 
; so until next time, take care, and be skeptical of things that 
; are not true, while being wise enough to know the difference and 
; tolerant enough to know that you could be mistaken.
