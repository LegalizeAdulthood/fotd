; FOTD -- December 18, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image has been named "The Phantom Wave".  Don't ask me 
; why I gave it such a name -- I have no idea.  The name might 
; refer to a wave of bubbles or a wave of midgets, or even a wave 
; of FOTD images calculated by the MandelbrotMix4 formula.  More 
; likely, it's a wave in my imagination.  But whatever the reason, 
; there must be some kind of wave connected with the image, which 
; lies in the parent fractal created by subtracting 0.9 parts of 
; Z^(1.2) from 2 parts of Z^(-1.2) and adding (1/C).
; 
; The bubbly effect in the image was achieved by rendering the 
; scene with the outside=fmod and the proximity=3.  At the moment 
; I am not sure how the 'fmod' option works and how the proximity 
; affects it, but the information is somewhere in the monumental 
; stack of help included with the Fractint program.
; 
; I could rate the image no higher than a 5, a rating that is 
; ho-hum average.  No, I do not expect a rush to see the image 
; when I admit in the discussion that it is un-exceptional, but 
; the fun lies in finding the FOTD images and writing about them.  
; Profit is obviously no motive in the creation of the FOTD.
; 
; The render time on my worn-out P200 machine, which just barely 
; keeps slogging along, is almost exactly 6 minutes.  On the state-
; of-the-art units out there the image will render notably faster. 
; The fastest way of all to see the phantom wave is to download it 
; from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;        <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and examine the image very carefully for any signs of a wave.
; 
; The Wednesday rain here at Fractal Central changed to snow at 
; 2pm, but ended within an hour before accumulating on the ground. 
; The cats, who spent the entire day indoors, were not concerned 
; with the change-over.  They needed only a small treat of tuna in 
; the evening to maintain their good spirits.
; 
; Today is starting partly cloudy, breezy, and cold -- the kind of 
; day that keeps fractal cats indoors and the fractal human busy 
; working on the next FOTD, which will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and be at peace.
