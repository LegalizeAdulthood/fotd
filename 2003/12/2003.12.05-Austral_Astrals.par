; FOTD -- December 05, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To create today's image I added a tiny bit of Z^i to the Mandel-
; brot set and examined the East Valley area of the resulting 
; fractal, which on the large scale is indistinguishable from the 
; M-set itself.  But though that tiny imaginary part makes no 
; difference on the large scale, it does make changes on the 
; smaller scale, especially in the area near the real axis.
; 
; Today's image is one of a midget in the East Valley area of the 
; M-set.  The midget has been shifted and changed somewhat by the 
; addition of the tiny imaginary part to the formula.  But by far 
; the greatest part of the effect of the image is a result of 
; rendering the outside with the 'fmod' option.
; 
; The blue background appears to be blended unusually smoothly for 
; a 256-color GIF image, but a close examination will still reveal 
; traces of color bands.  Because of the extra effort I put into 
; smoothing the background, I have decided to again reward myself 
; with a rating of 7.
; 
; After a few moments study, I named the image "Austral Astrals", 
; which might be roughly translated as 'southern stars'.  I had no 
; good reason for choosing such a name.  The words simply sounded 
; good to me.
; 
; Those who plan to run the included parameter file will find them-
; selves facing an 11-minute wait to see the image.  Those who 
; decide to download the completed image will see it faster.  The 
; GIF file of the image may be downloaded from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:

; 
; Thursday was cloudy and chilly here at Fractal Central.  The 
; cats managed about 30 minutes in the yard before the temperature 
; of 36F 2C chilled their ears and brought them indoors to their 
; window shelves.  The traditional evening treat of tuna eased 
; their chagrin.  But this morning we have around 6 inches, 15cm 
; of snow on the ground, and it is still snowing heavily in big 
; fat 'quarter-pounder' flakes.  The local weather experts are 
; forecasting up to 16 inches 40cm by the time it ends later 
; Saturday.  The cats will not be happy about this.
; 
; I'll be happy however, for despite my advancing age, I still 
; enjoy watching the snow fall.  And for some reason, fractals 
; appear to look better in snowy weather.  Until next time, take 
; care, and I guess I'll be shoveling off.
