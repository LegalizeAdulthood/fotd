; FOTD -- December 20, 2003 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Have no fear, fractal fans.  Despite my announcement that I will 
; likely miss a few FOTD's between now and the first of the year 
; and Scott's announcement that he will no longer be posting the 
; new FOTD images on his web site after the first of the year, the 
; FOTD will continue basically uninterrupted into the indefinite 
; (but most likely not eternal) future.  People might be temporary 
; but fractals are forever.
; 
; Today's image is a loser.  I named it "Baubles and Things" 
; because it reminds me of what one might see if they were to pull 
; open a small drawer that hasn't been opened in years.  Also, the 
; name reminds me of one of the 'trendy' names one might see on a 
; near-useless store that has replaced a very-useful store in the 
; downtown section of some 'rejuvenated' small town.  The rating 
; of a 3 is a gift.
; 
; The image is a scene in the grossly-bloated parent fractal that 
; results when 5.5 parts of Z^(-0.93) are subtracted from 5.7 
; parts of Z^(-0.77) and (1/C) is added.  Despite the near totally-
; chaotic nature of the scene, it was rendered by the convention-
; al, old-fashioned equal-iteration-band method.  When rendered 
; with the outside=tdis, the image becomes even more chaotic, 
; though some may prefer the 'tdis' version.
; 
; Today's pathetic image renders in 14 minutes, about 14 times as 
; long as it is worth.  But you may get what you paid for by 
; downloading the completed GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; I will no longer list the address of Scott's FOTD web site.  
; After the first of the year, he will no longer be adding the new 
; FOTD images to his site.
; 
; Friday was quite cold here at Fractal Central, with a tempera-
; ture that hovered just above the freezing mark all day and a few 
; flakes of snow thrown in for fun.  The fractal cats had no fun 
; however.  They spent the day sleeping on their blanket by the 
; radiator.  Today looks to be a repeat.
; 
; I have a small to moderate amount of work to finish before I 
; start the search for the next FOTD.  So until the next FOTD 
; appears in either one or two days, take care and take care again.
