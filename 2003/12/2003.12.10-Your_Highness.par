; FOTD -- December 10, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's venture into Fractal Land takes us to the fractal 
; created when one-half part of Z^(-7.5) is added to 5 parts of 
; Z^(-1.5) before (1/C) is added.  The resulting fractal consists 
; of two separate parts -- a main part with several large bays and 
; a smaller area of non-critical stuff located some distance to 
; the southwest of the main part.  I have examined this cut-off 
; area for over an hour without finding signs that midgets might 
; lie there.  It does have some striking tree-like elements 
; however, which I might use in some future FOTD.
; 
; Today's scene is located rather deep in the southern branch of 
; the valley that cuts off the prominent bud at the eastern end of 
; the string of bays comprising the main part of the parent fractal.
; 
; The image is named "Your Highness", which is a term used when 
; addressing a person of very high rank, such as a king.  The name 
; was inspired by the royal blue color of the midget at the 
; center.  This color extends to the arms radiating from the 
; midget, giving them an unusually sharp, royal definition.
; 
; Before deciding on the standard 'equal-iteration-band' version 
; of today's scene, I tried the other outside options, and also 
; the various 'evaporated' inside options.  The other outside 
; options create an image that is too busy.  The inside options 
; applied to the 'evaporated' version are either too busy or too 
; simple, the lone exception being the bof61 option, which creates 
; an exaggerated, rather hectic variation of the standard version. 
; If I had been in a different mood, I might have chosen this 
; variation.
; 
; I rated today's picture an above-average 7, a rating that might 
; be a bit more than it deserves.  But I do like the deep-blue 
; color of the midget and its arms, and I decided to reward 
; myself.  The render time of 11 minutes is getting to be a habit. 
; Relief is at hand however on the FOTD web sites, where the GIF 
; image may be found, already rendered.  Those sites are at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; I am currently reading the NovDec issue of 'Skeptical Inquirer' 
; magazine, a publication of CSICOP that I have been reading for 
; many years.  Ever since I came to realize that its main agenda 
; is to promote the materialistic philosophies, and that it uses 
; science chiefly to add validity to its claims, I no longer take 
; it as seriously as I once did, but I still find it quite 
; entertaining and informative, often containing much to ponder.  
; If I have time, I'll do some public pondering in the philo-
; fractal version of tomorrow's FOTD, when, depending on one's 
; point of view, I will spread either wisdom or superstition.
; 
; Tuesday brought partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 43F 6C 
; to Fractal Central.  The fractal cats were neutral about the 
; conditions, and did little of note while they were outside.  
; When they came in, they asked for tuna, but when they got none, 
; they settled for their regular food,
; 
; Today, I fear the next rain area is moving in.  Hopefully, the 
; cats' indifferent mood will continue through the rain.  As for 
; me, I'm about 1/3 of the way through the day's work.  If I'm 
; lucky, I'll finish before the rain arrives.  Until next time, 
; take extra care and then a bit more care.
