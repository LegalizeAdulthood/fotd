; FOTD -- December 09, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The following paragraph is about a spam e-mail scam.  Those who 
; would rather not read about spam e-mail should skip to the third 
; paragraph.
; 
; ;-)   Among the 150 or so pieces of junk mail that I found in my 
; e-mail box this morning was an 'official' notice, claiming to be 
; from my Earthlink ISP, informing me that they needed to confirm 
; my billing information.  The link led me to a web site where I 
; was to enter my credit-card number, etc.  (No personal informa-
; tion is in the fractal-dedicated machine that I used.)  My 
; opinion (actually I'm almost certain) is that the letter is a 
; scam, intended to fraudulently acquire credit-card numbers, and 
; even if it is serious, which I doubt, then Earthlink is so inept 
; that I would rather not be connected with them.  Who wants an 
; ISP that can't even keep track of the billing information of its 
; own customers.   ;-)
; 
; I guess I should not be too hard on them, after all, I sometimes 
; lose track of my own fractals.  But today's image is one I most 
; definitely have not lost track of -- not yet, at least.  It is a 
; scene in the fractal that appears when 24 parts of Z^(-1.1) are 
; combined with 26.4 parts of Z^(-11) and (1/C) is added.
; 
; The 8 loop-like elements surrounding the midget are typical of 
; fractals that have been created by combining negative powers of 
; Z and adding 1/C.  I have never seen these loops in fractals 
; that contain a positive power of Z, though most likely, if I 
; tried hard enough, I could find some.
; 
; In the parent fractal of today's image, the filaments extending 
; from the buds terminate in rings, kind of like the finger-ring 
; on the end of a window-shade string.  This ring-like nature is 
; reflected in the midgets lying in the area, as today's midget, 
; where the rings are stretched into eggs, demonstrates.
; 
; I named today's image "Minus-Minus Midget" because of the two 
; negative exponents of Z that were involved in its creation.  My 
; first impression was to rate it at a 7, but then I thought I saw 
; a trace of muddiness, and reduced the rating to a 6, which is 
; still a bit above average, though a boringly common rating.
; 
; The render time of 11 minutes borders on slow, especially for 
; those with other tasks for their machines.  But the 11-minute 
; wait can be cut to a minute or so by downloading the completed 
; image from:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;        <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; A sunny but chilly late autumn day passed uneventfully here at 
; Fractal Central on Monday.  The cats thought that the tempera-
; ture of 37F 3C was a bit chilly and the snow was still a bit too 
; deep, but they did venture onto the path in the yard, which had 
; been cleared but was still wet.  After an hour or so, they came 
; indoors to pass the rest of the day sleeping.
; 
; Today appears to be a slightly-warmer repeat.  The work is about 
; average; the cats' mood is average; all else is about average.  
; Most likely, except for the fractal I will find when the work is 
; finished, the day will be forgettable.  And never forget that 
; the next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.
