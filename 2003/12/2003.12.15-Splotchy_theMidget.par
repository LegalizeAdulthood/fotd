; FOTD -- December 15, 2003 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's mediocre image consists entirely of 'bof61' inside fill. 
; But it is not a scene in an 'evaporated' fractal; it is a 
; glimpse of something that might have existed, but never did.  It 
; is a scene in the blank screen that results when 1.1 parts of 
; 1/Z are subtracted from 1.1 parts of Z^(0.8) and C is added.
; 
; When one is exploring the world of fractals, blank screens 
; usually mean a dead end, but like so many other things in life, 
; there are exceptions.  Today's image is one of these.  The image 
; consists of a string of splotches, vaguely defining a midget at 
; the center.  This midget is not a real midget.  It is a virtual 
; midget that almost but not quite exists, and needs just a little 
; extra energy in the form of the 'bof61' inside fill to make it 
; fully manifest.
; 
; The result is not all that might be desired, rating only a 4.  
; The render time of 10 minutes has been made a bit more interest-
; ing by using the 'inside=b' option, which is quite a bit of fun 
; to see in action.  As always, those who feel more serious about 
; their fractals can escape the fun by downloading the completed 
; image from Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; That long-promised philosophy appears in the version of today's 
; FOTD that has been posted on the philofractal list.
; 
; Snow and cold rain on Sunday kept the fractal cats indoors.  The 
; conditions were so unpleasant however that they were happy to 
; sleep by their radiators for most of the day.  In the evening I 
; gave them their small treat of tuna, and they ended the day 
; peacefully.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy and breezy, with some slushy snow on 
; the ground.  But it is not too cold.  It remains to be seen how 
; the duo will take such conditions.  I usually take conditions as 
; they come.  The work is moderate, the weather is moderate, the 
; next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; don't despair.
