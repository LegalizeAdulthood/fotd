; FOTD -- March 08, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us back to perhaps the most familiar of all 
; fractal areas -- Seahorse Valley of the classic Mandelbrot Set.  
; This is the first area of the first fractal I investigated when 
; I loaded my first fractal-generating program those many years 
; ago, and the area still holds undiscovered surprises.
; 
; Today's image illustrates a second-order midget that lies in the 
; suburbs of a larger midget that lies fairly deep in the eastern 
; shore of the north branch of Seahorse Valley.  The parent midget 
; quite closely resembles the midget in the image, though, being 
; of a much lesser magnitude, the surrounding pattern is packed 
; closer to the midget itself.
; 
; I named the image "Classic Mandelbrot" for obvious reasons.  
; Since it is part of such a familiar area, I could rate the 
; picture no higher than an average 5.  The render time of almost 
; 4 hours, (at least on my machine), makes a download of the 
; finished GIF image almost compulsory.
; 
; The download may be found on Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and on Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The FOTD-CD is moving slowly toward completion.  (I do realize 
; I have said this before!)  The slowness is caused by the fact 
; that for every problem I fix, I find a new problem that needs 
; fixing.  The problem I'm currently working on was created when I 
; altered formulas without changing their names, which causes 
; parameter files to go to the wrong version of the formula and 
; come up blank.  When I solve this problem, I can begin changing 
; the cryptic names of the GIF image files to names that corres-
; pond to the dates of the discussion.  Hopefully, when this is 
; done, I will make the big announcement.
; 
; With a high remperature of 35F 1.5C, the fractal weather Friday 
; was too chilly for the cats' paws.  Also, the ground is still 
; snow-covered.  As a result, the duo spent the afternoon indoors, 
; impatiently waiting for spring to arrive.  But today (Saturday) 
; was warmer, and the duo endured their wet cold paws as they 
; spent a half hour checking their territory in the 50F 10C air 
; temperature.
; 
; I spent the day working and trying to iron out the problems in 
; the FOTD CD.  But Sunday I'm going to take a break, and forget 
; work and fractals until Monday.  Until next Saturday, when the 
; next FOTD will appear, take care, and anything worth having is 
; worth waiting for -- especially a few thousand fractals.
