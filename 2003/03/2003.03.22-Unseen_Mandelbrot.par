; FOTD -- March 22, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With no daily FOTD, the Fractint and philofractal lists are 
; basically dead.  But, as I have often said, there is no need for 
; concern.  I, for one, am not losing enthusiasm for fractals.  I 
; am simply in the tedious process of getting the FOTD-CD up to a 
; level where it is worth spending 20 dollars for.  This process 
; is being complicated by a seasonal crush of other work, which 
; must be given priority.
; 
; Also, I must leave town for an appointment early next week, and 
; I have decided to use the appointment as an excuse for a 3-day 
; vacation.  I realize that this will slow things down, but I have 
; had no time off since September of 2000.
; 
; This being covered, it is time to get to the day's image.  It 
; is a picture of a midget lying near a larger midget deep in a 
; filament on the second bud out the main negative stem of the 
; Mandelbrot set.  Since the chances of this particular midget 
; ever having been previously seen are in effect zero, I have 
; named the picture "Unseen Mandelbrot".
; 
; The magnitude lies in the upper range of arbitrary precision 
; math, which results in an image that takes just over 1/2 hour to 
; render on my machine.  There is not much to be said about the 
; image other than it is a typical deep midget on a filament.  Due 
; to its average nature, I gave the image an average rating of 5.
; 
; The image may be seen by starting the attached parameter file 
; and waiting 1/2 hour, but the better way of viewing it is to 
; download the finished image file from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The week just ended was quite cold, damp and rainy here at 
; Fractal Central.  The fractal duo spent the week sitting by the 
; window, wishing conditions were more pleasant.  Much tuna and 
; some turkey was needed to keep their moods liveable.  Today 
; (Saturday) is starting more pleasantly, with sun and warmer 
; temperatures.  I foresee better moods in the near future.
; 
; As for myself, I'm going to take a well-earned 3-day vacation at 
; the ocean Monday to Wednesday before getting back to work and 
; doing the things that need to be done, such as the CD.  The next 
; FOTD will appear on March 29.  Until then, take care, and keep 
; fractals alive.
