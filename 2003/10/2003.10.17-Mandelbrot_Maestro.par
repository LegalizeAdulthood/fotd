; CLASSIC FOTD October 10, 1998 (Mandelbrot Maestro)
; 
; Fractal visionaries:
; 
; It was cloudy today here in fractal land, with a few light 
; showers in the evening.  The high temperature of 68F 20C was 
; perfect for exploring a hyperfractal, which I did with my 
; Mandel_4-D formula.
; 
; Every fractal explorer knows that when the starting point of Z 
; is perturbed, the features of the resulting image are distorted. 
; But when the fractal is a four-dimensional Mandelbrot set, the 
; distortion can be downright grotesque, as today's image shows.
; 
; The mis-shapen object in today's picture is the prominent midget 
; on the negative tail of the 4-D hyper-M-set, viewed in a remote 
; perturbed plane.  I have named the picture "Mandelbrot Maestro" 
; because that phrase popped into my head as I studied the image. 
; I can't begin to explain why the image appears as it does.  Nor 
; can I explain exactly what the formula does.
; 
; At times, the fractals drawn by this formula don't make sense, 
; leading me to suspect that some of the images are artifacts.  
; I'll need to do quite a bit of testing before I can add comment 
; lines -- something that I have resolved to start doing with all 
; my formulas.  (Nothing is more annoying than having a formula 
; and not knowing how to make it work.)
; 
; The GIF file of today's quick image has been posted to:
; 
;         http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html
; 
; Tomorrow . . . who knows?  I'll be here again with another 
; fractal -- that's for sure, but as to what type of fractal it 
; will be -- I won't know until I actually see it.  Even then I 
; may not know.  So until then, take care, and didn't someone 
; once claim that the fractals of Autumn are the best of the 
; entire year?
