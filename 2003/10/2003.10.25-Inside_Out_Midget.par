; FOTD October 25, 2003
; 
; I include the original discussion that went with today's 
; fractal, but the image is almost totally new.  The original 
; image as it appeared on May 15, 2001 consisted of a Mandeloid-
; shaped object at the center of a largely empty frame.  As it 
; appears today, the Mandeloid has been turned upside down, and I 
; have zoomed in much tighter.  The color is also entirely new.  
; All these changes make the image virtually a new one and have 
; justified a name change from "All Pooped Out" to "Inside-Out 
; Midget".  The sizzling render time of one minute should make 
; running the parameter file almost a joy.

; 
; Classic FOTD -- May 15, 2001 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Where are all those extra FOTD's coming from?  Every time I post 
; through AOL, it seems to happen.
; 
; Today's FOTD holds a surprise.  During the first half of the 
; render, it looks notably unimpressive, but the lower half 
; features a most unusual Mandeloid.  This is not a midget -- it 
; is the whole fractal, which explains why the render goes so fast.
; 
; The iterated formula is a simple one, subtracting a portion of 
; Z^(-0.7) from Z^(0.7) then adding 1/C.  The result is a picture 
; of a totally pooped-out Mandeloid lying flat on its face.  I had 
; no choice but to name the image "All Pooped Out".  I rated it a 
; 7 because I think it's kind of cute, though I really don't care 
; much for funny-face fractals.
; 
; The render time of under 3 minutes is reasonable.  If it is not 
; reasonable enough, the GIF file of the image is available on the 
; Web at Paul's site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather today was reasonably pleasant, though a dry 
; squall spoiled the evening.  The afternoon temperature of 73F 
; (23C) kept the cats happy.
; 
; I've got a busy day coming, so that's it for now.  Until next 
; FOTD, take care, and see you soon.
