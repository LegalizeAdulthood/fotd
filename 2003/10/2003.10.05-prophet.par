; Fractal of the Day, June 19, 1997
; 
; Fractal visionaries:
; 
; Every once in a while there comes a fractal picture that fairly 
; shouts its name.  Today's image is one of those.  Despite the 
; abysmal initial coloring, the moment I saw the image, with its 
; stylized figure standing on a mountain top, showering blessings, 
; I knew it could be named nothing but "prophet".  It took only a 
; carefully selected palette to bring the prophet to life.
; 
; The formula is one of my failed efforts.  But though the formula 
; doesn't give me exactly what I was after, it does draw some very 
; interesting images, which have earned it a place in my permanent 
; formula file.
; 
; Probably half the formulas in my collection were failures when I 
; first tried them.  But success can sometimes come from failure, 
; and unless a formula draws nothing but a blank screen, I almost 
; never give up on it until I have tried a wide variety of 
; parameters.  My current effort to draw all the oblique and skew 
; planes in the julibrot figure is producing an unusually rich 
; variety of formulas and images.
; 
; For tomorrow's fractal, I'm going to wing it.  Maybe I'll post 
; another of my lucky accident fractals; maybe one of my older 
; gems.  But whatever it turns out to be, it will be interesting.
; 
; Today's image has been solemnly posted to Paul's web site at:

;         <>
; 
; for the convenience of those who can't tie up their machines.
