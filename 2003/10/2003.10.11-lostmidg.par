; Classic F.O.T.D.  December 21, 1997 (Lost Midget)
; 
; Fractal visionaries:
; 
; Happy Solstice!  This, after all, is what the season is really 
; about.  In the Northern Hemisphere it's the shortest day of the 
; year; in the Southern Hemisphere it's the longest day of the 
; year; at the equator it's just another 12-hour day; while at the 
; North Pole it's the middle of the six-month-long night, and at 
; the South Pole it's high noon of the six-month-long day.
; 
; Here at coordinates 39.20 north 76.30 west, the sun sets at 
; 4:45pm, which is not too bad when one considers places like 
; Norway and Sweden, which receive almost no sunlight at all at 
; this time of year.
; 
; But the shortage of sunlight certainly does not imply a shortage 
; of fractals.  Today's fractal is ample proof of this.  I've 
; named it "The Lost Midget" because, like yesterday's FOTD, 
; (which BTW was wrongly dated 19-12), it illustrates one of those 
; obscure midgets that instead of actually existing, has merely a 
; tendency to exist.  I chose this particular midget because it 
; best illustrates the effect of a ghostly something that is not 
; really there.
; 
; The formula is a generalized one of the form, (Z^n+C)+(C^n+Z).  
; It is one of an experimental series that I worked up a few 
; months back and then laid aside.  I've actually got versions of 
; this formula that draw all six perpendicular planes.  (I do this 
; with most all my formulas.)  Some of the odd planes of this 
; series are most unusual, so expect to be seeing more of them in 
; the near future.
;

; site at:

; 
; Tomorrow will bring a longer (or shorter) day and a new fractal. 
; At this time, I can't say what I'll decide on, but what ever it 
; is, it will be interesting.  So until then, take care and never 
; choose a fractal when you play charade.
