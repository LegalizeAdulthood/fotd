; F.O.T.D., September 28, 1997 (Pollock)
; 
; Fractal visionaries:
; 
; Today's prize-winner fractal is named in honor of that not quite 
; so famous American abstract artist, J. Pollock.  The resemblance 
; to the paint drippings which made him almost famous is apparent.
; 
; I achieved such an effect by taking a nondescript Rectangular 
; plane fractal and redoing it with the inside fill set to epsilon 
; cross.  I'm not sure how this option achieves its effects.  I 
; think it colors the image according to whether the points' 
; orbits come closest to the real or imag axis.
; 
; Until recently I had never used this option, considering such a 
; fancy fill method artificial, but I have now had second thoughts 
; about fractals.  There is no such thing as a "natural" or "pure" 
; fractal other than the bare formula.  And since a natural frac-
; tal doesn't exist, it makes no sense to try to maintain fractal 
; purity.  And since I no longer must try to keep my fractals 
; pure, I will be able to use the entire range of Fractint's 
; coloring options without compunction.
; 
; For best effect, today's fractal should be drawn at a minimum 
; resolution of 1024x768, to prevent the streaks of paint from 
; breaking up.  The finished image is available at:
; 
;         http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html
; 
; Until tomorrow then, may your fractals be infinitely beautiful.
