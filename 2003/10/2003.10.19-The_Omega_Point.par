; FOTD November 17, 1998 (The Omega Point)
; 
; Fractal visionaries:
; 
; The weather today was so dull that I can barely remember it.  Oh 
; yes, it was partly cloudy with a temperature of 60F 15.5C and a 
; south wind at 12kph.  Regardless, it was a perfect day for 
; scrounging in fractal land for that one perfect fractal that 
; might exist among the infinity of infinities of fractals that 
; might exist.  Unfortunately, tonight has become totally cloudy, 
; and the meteor storm, if it happens, (which I doubt), will be 
; invisible from fractal central.  But I'll be up around 5am just 
; in case a hole opens in the clouds and the meteors are there.
; 
; The fractal I found was created by the next in my series of 12 
; MandNewt formulas, MandNewt10.  This formula, as well as 
; numbers 11 and 12, has six variable parameters.  Since the six 
; parameters are limited to real numbers, the resulting fractals 
; always have X-axis symmetry.  In some cases, the extra variable 
; parameters are redundant, simply increasing or decreasing the 
; values of other parameters, but overall the result is totally 
; unpredictable, which is the way I like my fractals.
; 
; I named the picture "The Omega Point" because as I studied it, I 
; wondered if there could possibly be a last fractal.  Actually, 
; that's the way I name most of my fractal pictures -- I stare at 
; them until a name comes into my head.  The picture is a lot like 
; my "Fractoland" picture of several days ago, though I'm not 
; blaming this one on Dr. J.
; 
; The picture has vague buds half obscured by bits and pieces of 
; ectoplasmic fractal material, and areas of chaos offset by 
; organized areas of quasi-order.  But this image has at least a 
; hint of order amid the most chaotic disorder.  The spiral 
; occupying most of the top third has no corresponding feature in 
; the earlier picture.  This spiral reminds me somewhat of the 
; images produced by the Barnsley formulas.
; 
; The GIF file has been posted to:
; 
;          <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; And now I suspect that the honorable thing to do would be to 
; wrap this up and see if I can get it posted.  Until next time, 
; when I shall likely be a bit more settled, take care, and 
; remember that no matter how far you search, you will never find 
; the last fractal.
