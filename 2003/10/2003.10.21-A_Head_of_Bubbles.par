; Do not go to the fractal image of June 2000.  Today's version is 
; a slight outzoom of the original image.  The color has also been 
; refined.

; 
; CLASSIC FOTD, June 10, 2000  (Break-away Fractal [6])
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is another surrealistic scene created with one 
; of the MandNewt formulae, which are actually the Ikenaga 
; function in disguise.  I chose formula number 1 to explore for 
; today's image, and the formula did not let me down.
; 
; As is the case with many images created with these formulas, the 
; inside fill has been set to bof60, which has a tendency to 
; create bubbles.  The bof61 inside fill also works well with 
; these formulas, as was demonstrated with yesterday's FOTD.
; 
; The picture itself is another surrealistic one, with a mass of 
; bubbly froth at the bottom and bubbles of assorted sizes and 
; shapes all through the scene.  The largest bubble is off-screen, 
; though its lower part fills the upper left of the picture.  The 
; intense purple background speaks of infinite depth.
; 
; I named the picture "A Head of Bubbles" when I noticed the 
; effect of individual bubbles breaking away from the mass of 
; froth.  The parameter file takes all of 6-1/2 minutes to render 
; on a P200 machine.  If that is too slow, the GIF image file has 
; been posted to Paul Lee's web site at:
; 
;         <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The fractal weather today was quite warm, but without the 
; oppressiveness we have so much of in this area in the summer.  
; The temperature of 88F (31C) was a bit warmer than the fractal 
; cats would have preferred, but they spent the afternoon on the 
; back porch anyway.
; 
; My philosophy once again floundered -- I'll try again tomorrow.  
; Until then, take care, and when it's hot, try a cool fractal.
