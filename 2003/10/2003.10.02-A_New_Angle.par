; FOTD July 05, 1999 (A New Angle) (c)
; 
; Fractal enthusiasts, lurkers and visionaries:
; 
; As I write this FOTD, I can look through the fractal shoppe 
; window and see three separate fireworks displays in progress 
; around the city.  And the weather is also hot as a firecracker.  
; Once again the predicted showers failed to appear, but the heat 
; did not fail.  It is getting ever more oppressive.  The 
; temperature of 99F (37C) was great for nothing but fractals.  
; Tomorrow is due to be even hotter, so I suppose tomorrow will 
; also be good for nothing.
; 
; Today's picture is a new view of yesterday's cubic midget.  It 
; is actually the same scene of the Julibrot sliced in a different 
; direction.  The midget itself lies buried near the center of the 
; frame.  It's quite stretched and a bit hard to find.
; 
; At this angle, which is close to halfway between the Parabolic 
; and Oblate directions, the surrounding pattern undergoes a 
; strange transformation.  We can see the nine elements converging 
; on the midget, but before they can trifurcate into 27 elements, 
; they get cut off, and form some rather interesting configura-
; tions.  (The 27-element convergence never appears.)
; 
; I named the picture "A New Angle" to bring out the fact that it 
; is a different aspect of yesterday's image.  Yes, I did give the 
; image a boost in a graphics program, but not enough to damage 
; its purity.  It's a very fast fractal, so it might be quicker to 
; run the parameter file than to download the JPEG image file from:
; 
;           <alt.binaries.pictures.fractals>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Since I've already exceeded my speculative philosophical quota 
; for the day in earlier letters, I'll add nothing at this time.  
; But I will be here again tomorrow with another fractal, which 
; easily could be another view of the same scene.  I also could 
; easily erupt into more philosophy, (if my ramblings qualify as 
; such).  Check then to see what happens.  Until then, take care, 
; and I've yet to see the first fractal fireworks display.
