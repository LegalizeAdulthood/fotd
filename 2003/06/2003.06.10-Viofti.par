; FOTD -- June 10, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal image is named "Viofti".  I have no idea what 
; the word means.  It could have a meaning in another language, 
; though I doubt it.  The word came into my head as I studied the 
; image, searching for a name, and somehow it seems to fit the 
; otherwise indescribable scene.
; 
; The image is an 'evaporated' one, consisting totally of trapped 
; 'inside' points made visible by the 'fmod' option.  The parent 
; fractal, which is really there when the bailout radius is more 
; reasonable, was created by iterating the quite simple formula 
; -0.5Z^(-6)-3(1/Z)+(1/C).  There is no need to describe this 
; parent, for in today's image it no longer exists as a real 
; fractal.
; 
; The scene of today's image is actually quite close to a ghost 
; midget, which I might feature in a future FOTD.  As it is, the 
; surreal objects floating before a space of infinite depth have 
; such vivid definition that I rated the image a 7 even though it 
; holds no midget.
; 
; An additional good point of today's image is its speed.  The 
; render time of 5 minutes is a welcome relief from images such as 
; yesterday's, which took 2 hours to finish.  And believe it or 
; not, today's image produces more fractal bang in 5 minutes than 
; yesterday's did in 2 hours.
; 
; If the 5-minute wait is still not brief enough, the download of 
; the completed image is even faster.  The download can be found 
; at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; A mostly sunny day here at Fractal Central on Monday, with an 
; afternoon temperature of 79F 26C, made the fractal cats happy, 
; and me as well.  Due to the pleasant weather, they spent the 
; entire afternoon in the yard.  When the day was finished, they 
; settled into sleep without the need for a treat of tuna or 
; turkey.  Today promises to be another near-perfect day.  Could 
; the dynamic duo possibly be angelic two days in a row?
; 
; I've got a bit of work to wrap up before I can concentrate on 
; fractals, so until next FOTD, take care, and see you in 24 hours.
