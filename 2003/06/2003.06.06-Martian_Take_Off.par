; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's image we return to the chaos along the shoreline of 
; the Z^(1.04)+C Mandeloid.  I really should not say *THE* 
; shoreline, I should say *A* shoreline, because the Z^(1.04)+C 
; Mandeloid has an infinity of shorelines, and the shoreline in 
; question is but one of that infinity.  The shoreline is actually 
; part of the parent as it appears in the slice 40 turns up the 
; logarithmic spiral.
; 
; As the exponent of Z is lowered ever closer to unity, the chaos 
; in the more remote logarithmic slices of fractals first grows 
; more chaotic, with large areas of what I call sand.  The sand is 
; present down to an exponent of around 1.01, where, due to its 
; increasingly high maxiter, it becomes so hard to reveal that it 
; is impractical to explore.  Below this point, the Mandeloid 
; fractals resemble mere jagged pieces of rock.  The amount of 
; sand peaks at an exponent of around 1.1, where it sometimes 
; contains quite interesting sub-patterns.  As the exponent is 
; raised, the sand never really disappears, but becomes confined 
; ever closer to the shoreline.
; 
; By stretching my imagination, I saw in today's image a scene on 
; a fantastic Planet Mars.  Using a bit more imagination, aided by 
; the film "War of the Worlds", I saw a fleet of space ships 
; taking off on their way to invade earth, and named the image 
; "Martian Take-Off".  I assume that, thanks to its bacteria, the 
; earth will survive the invasion of the fractal space craft.
; 
; There is something about the image that I like.  Maybe it's the 
; jagged rust-colored rocks and space ships, maybe it's the blue 
; of the Martian sky.  Whatever it is, I rated the image at a much-
; above-average 8.
; 
; With the help of a little imagination, the invasion fleet can be 
; seen by running the parameter file and eagerly waiting for 15 
; minutes.  The fleet can also be seen by downloading the pre-
; rendered image from one of the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Fine sunny weather and a temperature of 77F 25C here at Fractal 
; Central on Thursday made for contented cats.  The aging duo made 
; the most of the situation by spending the day in the yard, 
; watching for the new grey-and-white cat who moved in up the 
; hill a couple weeks ago.  Luckily for someone, the cat never 
; showed up, and the once-dynamic duo had a restful day.  Today is 
; starting sunny again, which should assure the duo another good 
; day.
; 
; My day will be busy as I finish the work I failed to finish 
; yesterday.  And when the work is finished, I'll launch the 
; search for the next FOTD fractal.  Until next time, take care, 
; and is there earth life on Mars?
