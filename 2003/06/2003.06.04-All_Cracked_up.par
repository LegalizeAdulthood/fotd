; FOTD -- June 04, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have named today's unusually somber excursion into the land of 
; fractal discontinuity "All Cracked-up", though it really gives 
; no impression of being unusually discontinuous.  The outstanding 
; feature is the preponderance of deep blues, with only a few 
; spots of brilliant relief from the overall depressed mood.  
; (Maybe it's mimicking the fractal cats.)
; 
; In keeping with the unintentional theme of the month, today's 
; image is once again part of one of the infinity of fractals 
; created by the simple formula Z^(1.5)+C.  This time it is the 
; fractal found 12 turns up the complex logarithmic spiral, which 
; itself is a total abstraction.
; 
; In low-order fractals such as today's, as the exponent of Z 
; drops ever farther below the value of 2, the midgets become ever 
; more difficult to find.  When the exponent is 1.5, the midgets 
; are rather difficult to track down, though it is still reason-
; ably simple to do.  In fact, the task of finding midgets is 
; doable down to an exponent of 1.2.  Below that value, finding 
; them is a matter of luck.
; 
; The lowest-order midget I have yet found is one with an exponent 
; of something like 1.04.  In this range, midgets are nothing more 
; than irregular, circular holes, with no bays and no organized 
; patterns surrounding them, though the parent fractals are filled 
; with large fields of interesting and discontinuous chaos.
; 
; Today's image has been rated by me at a 7.  Actually, the rating 
; of 7 is true only in a dimly-lit room.  In bright light it rates 
; only a 5 or 6.  
; 
; The render-time from the attached parameter file is a reasonable 
; 6 minutes.  By downloading the completed GIF image from one of 
; the FOTD web sites, the time can be made even more reasonable.  
; The FOTD web sites can be found at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The rains set in on schedule Tuesday afternoon here at Fractal 
; Central.  The temperature reached 63F 17C.  The cats' moods 
; deteriorated as expected, and the customary treat of tuna only 
; partially restored their good spirits.  The rain, which is still 
; falling this morning, will likely continue intermittently into 
; tonight.  I feel sorry for the sulky duo.
; 
; I've got my own problems to sulk about.  Customers who want more 
; material on a single page than can possibly fit there are a real 
; nuisance.  But I'll work it out.  Until next cracked FOTD, take 
; care, and where do fractals end?
