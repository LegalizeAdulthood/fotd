; FOTD -- June 14, 2003 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Due to a flood and power failure, I had little time to find an 
; honorable fractal for today.  What I did find was a collision 
; and partial merger of two midgets in the fractal created by 
; adding portions of Z^4, Z^5.
; 
; The real(p3) parameter is very critical to the shape of the 
; combined midgets, and changing its value by as little as 
; 0.000001 makes a noticeable change in the image.
; 
; I named the image "A Midget Collision" because that's what it 
; is.  I rated it at a 4 because that's all it's worth.  The 
; render time of just over 1 minute takes some of the disappoint-
; ment from the FOTD.  As always, the image can also be seen by 
; visiting one of the FOTD web sites and downloading it from 
; there.

; 
; Friday, with its temperature of 86F 30C, was a fine day until 
; 7pm when a thunder-storm of biblical proportions arose, flooding 
; the fractal basement to a depth of 6 inches and cutting the 
; power.  (I have always wondered how a sump pump is supposed to 
; keep the water down when the storm causes a power failure, as 
; usually happens.)  But it was far worse a couple blocks down the 
; road, where a sudden 10-foot flood washed the neighborhood cars 
; into a single heap of wreckage, with a Lincoln Towncar sitting 
; proudly on top.  There were numerous high-water rescues in the 
; area.  Luckily, the fractal cats were well ensconced in the 
; darkest closet during the spectacular noise.  More severe storms 
; are forecast for later today, so we'll see how it goes.
; 
; For me, I'm going to finish as many chores as possible before 
; the next deluge and power failure.  It's sunny at the present, 
; and the cats are in the yard.  All is temporarily well.  Until 
; next FOTD, take care, and be at ease.
