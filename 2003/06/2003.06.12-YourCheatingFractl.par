; FOTD -- June 12, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's hastily-found scene is a play on the number 6.  It is 
; typical of the scenes found in fractals created by combining two 
; negative powers of Z and adding the reciprocal of C.
; 
; With so little effort behind it, the image cannot be considered 
; rating any better than an average 5, but it still might be worth 
; the 7 minutes required to render it.
; 
; I named the picture "Your Cheating Fractal" for whimsical 
; reasons after I heard a song with almost the same name on the 
; fractal radio.  As far as I know, fractals are not conscious, 
; and therefore can not cheat.  But I have heard it said that 
; everything has a degree of consciousness, and since fractals are 
; members of the set of everything, they also might be conscious, 
; and therefore actually have an ability to cheat.
; 
; The parent fractal resembles a Mandelbrot set with its East 
; Valley missing, and surrounded by an extended field of chaos.  
; Today's scene is located near the inland limit of the chaos 
; field surrounding the main bud of the parent.
; 
; The 7-minute render time can be avoided by downloading the image 
; from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:

; 
; Wednesday was a near perfect day here at Fractal Central -- at 
; least for cats.  For humans it was a bit muggy, with high 
; humidity and a temperature of 86F 30C.  The cats spent several 
; presumably happy hours in the yard, while the humans did their 
; human work.  A heavy thunder-storm came up just after nightfall, 
; but by that time, the cats' good day had been established.
; 
; Today promises to be a repeat.  I assume the cats will repeat 
; their good mood.  My mood will improve when the work is finished 
; and the next FOTD is found, though it is not too bad as things 
; stand now.  Until next time, take care, and be faithful to your 
; fractals.
