; FOTD -- June 07, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us into even lower territory -- down below 
; yesterday's Z^(1.04) into the land of Z^(1.025)+C.  Down in 
; these depths, the chaos becomes harder to find, but as today's 
; image shows, it is still there.
; 
; The lengthy real(p2) parameter shows that the value was found by 
; the Fractint randomizer.  I could have rounded it to a 7 with 
; little change in the parent fractal.
; 
; Yesterday's image reminded me of a fleet of fantastic space 
; craft taking off from a Martian invasion base.  Today's image 
; reminds me of jagged shards of something being swept up and away 
; into infinite space by a sudden wind.  Since the wind is the 
; first in thousands of years to blow in this particular place, I 
; named the image "First Flight".
; 
; Today's image attempts the same effect as yesterday's superior 
; image, but compared to that image, today's rates only a 6.  But 
; today's image is not without its interest.  Despite the almost 
; total descent into chaos, there are still traces of order in the 
; image.  The curving trails of bright debris in the background 
; appear on the verge of organizing and creating a new class of 
; order.  I must examine this tendency of chaos to organize in 
; fractals with exponents even closer to unity.
; 
; The 16-minute render time can be avoided by downloading the 
; completed image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; A mostly cloudy but mild day here at Fractal Central on Friday 
; left the duo of fractal cats satisfied.  After spending the 
; afternoon enjoying the temperature of 75F 24C, they ended the 
; day enjoying a treat of turkey.  Their moods will be far less 
; pleasant today however.  It is already raining, heavy rain is 
; forecast and a flood watch is in effect.
; 
; I'm going to spend the day searching for fractals, working on 
; the CD, or just plain watching the rain.  Until next time, take 
; care, and let's see a few Mandelbrot midgets.
