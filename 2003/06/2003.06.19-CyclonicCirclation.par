; FOTD -- June 19, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In the northern hemisphere the atmosphere turns counter-
; clockwise as it is drawn into a cyclone and clockwise as it is 
; pushed from an anticyclone.  In the southern hemisphere exactly 
; the opposite is true.  But Fractal Central is located in the 
; northern hemisphere, and since the arms of today's spiral image 
; are moving inward in a counter-clockwise direction and curving 
; to the left as they go, the image can only be called "Cyclonic 
; Circulation".
; 
; When the atmosphere curves to the left in the northern 
; hemisphere, it causes low-level convergence, which forces the 
; air upward and squeezes any available moisture from it.  We have 
; had a lot of convergence at Fractal Central over the past two 
; months, where only 2 of the past 60 days have been clear.
; 
; People are joking that the farmers prayed for rain all last 
; year, and their prayers are being answered all this year.  Now 
; the farmers are praying for dry weather so they can work their 
; fields.  Worried about next year, my advice is for them to make 
; their prayers more specific.
; 
; On a more fractal note, the formula of today's image mixes 1.2 
; negative portions of Z^(1.4) with 0.3 parts of Z^(-0.8) and adds 
; (1/C).  It was calculated by the MandelbrotMix2 formula, which 
; is identical to the MandelbrotMix4 formula, except that it 
; includes the ability to change the automatically calculated 
; value of initial Z.
; 
; It's a rather lively image, enhanced by a brilliant palette of 
; colors.  With other color palettes, the image actually reminds 
; me of rows of shark's teeth, but a man-eating name would give a 
; wrong impression, so I chose the palette that reminds me of a 
; cyclone, and rated the image at a 7.
; 
; The 4-minute render time is within reason for an image that 
; rates a 7.  And as always, the completed GIF file is available 
; for download on Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and on Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Though the clouds hung tough on Wednesday, a bit of afternoon 
; sun did manage to break through, the rain held off, and the 
; temperature reached 75F 24C.  As a result, the fractal cats 
; were happy and I saved a can of tuna.  If only today could turn 
; out as well...but with rain having already fallen and more due, 
; it most likely will not.
; 
; The cats are still sleeping, but before long they will get up, 
; go to the door and ask to be let out.  They will then see the 
; rain and turn moody.  I fear tuna will be necessary.  Finishing 
; the day's work will also be necessary, but before I finish, I 
; must start.  Until next FOTD, take care, and keep dry, that is 
; if possible.
