; FOTD -- June 18, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is another scene in the East Valley area of the 
; parent fractal of yesterday's image.  Many of the same elements 
; are there, but with the outside being rendered with the 'fmod' 
; option, today's image is different enough to stand on its own 
; merits.
; 
; Today's rating of 6 is a big come-down from yesterday's perhaps-
; overblown rating of 9.  It is still worth a look however.  The 
; colors, which are not nearly as finely tuned, still get the 
; point across.
; 
; When I studied the image, searching for a name, I had the 
; impression of a Mandelbrot set being dropped into a body of 
; colored liquid, creating a huge splash.  What could I possibly 
; have named the image other than "Ker-splash"?
; 
; Curiously, if the bailout radius of today's image is raised to 
; 10^100, the image evaporates, leaving a blank screen of all-
; inside points.  Then, if the 'fmod' inside-fill option is 
; applied to the blank image and the proximity is kept at 0.9, 
; today's image will re-appear, the only difference being that 
; instead of rendering in 13 minutes, it now takes an hour to 
; render, and the inside of the midget now contains detail.
; 
; The fastest way to observe today's inside-or-outside image is to 
; download it in completed form from either Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's web site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Clouds hung around all day Tuesday.  The sprinkles that began at 
; 1pm turned into a steady rain by 6pm.  The temperature reached 
; 66F 19C, but what good is a pleasant temperature when rain is 
; falling?  The dynamic duo thought it was no good at all, and 
; quickly turned sulky, demanding a treat of tuna before resuming 
; their good spirits.  Since this morning is cloudy with more rain 
; promised, I had best stock up on the tuna.
; 
; The heavy clouds do not relieve me of the duty of doing the 
; waiting work however, so if I hope to finish, I had best get 
; started.  Until next FOTD, take care, and watch for lurking 
; fractals.
