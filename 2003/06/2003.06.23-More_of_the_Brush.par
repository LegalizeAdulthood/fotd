; FOTD -- June 23, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To start the day, I downloaded the usual hundred or so junk 
; e-mails.  Before deleting them, and being certain I was off-
; line, I checked the content of one e-mail, which had an 
; unusually clever subject line about an old friend who had just 
; found me.  Not surprisingly, the letter was not from an old 
; friend, but from one of those questionable on-line pharmacies 
; with doctors who prescribe prescription drugs without an examina-
; tion.  It would have been just another unwanted piece of junk 
; had it not been for the line that read, "if you act now, your 
; order can be shipped by January".  No wonder only one recipient 
; in ten-thousand replies to such letters.
; 
; Fractals are far more reasonable.  Today's image has been 
; created by an entirely different formula than yesterday's, but 
; the same brush-like shape is there.  Whereas I decided that 
; yesterday's image rated a 6 and then lowered it to a 5 at the 
; last minute, today's image rates a firm 7.  I named the image 
; "More of the Brush" in recognition of the fact that its basic 
; shape closely resemble the brush shape of yesterday's image.
; 
; The formula behind today's image is Z^10-Z^9+C.  This formula 
; produces a parent fractal that is little more than an circle 
; with broken bays around its perimeter.  It displays critical 
; characteristics only in the area of its 'East Valley', which is 
; where today's scene is located.
; 
; The outside parts of today's image were rendered by the 'fmod' 
; option, which in this case does a better job than the standard 
; equal-iteration-bands method.  The brilliant turquoise color of 
; the inside of the central midget is a departure from my standard 
; dead black inside color, used today because it works well.
; 
; The 5-minute render time is within reason, but the 1-minute-or-
; less download time is even more reasonable.  The GIF image can 
; be found, ready for download at either one of the two FOTD web 
; sites:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The clouds hung around most of Sunday at Fractal Central while 
; we were away on the shopping trip.  When we returned at 6pm, the 
; sun was trying to break through, the temperature was 79F 26C, 
; and the cats were ready to romp.  They enjoyed the yard for over 
; two hours before hunger brought them inside to eat.  Today is 
; sunny and warmer -- the kind of weather fractal cats approve of.
; 
; I've got a bit of work to do before I re-enter the world of 
; fractals, and the sooner I get started, the sooner I'll finish.  
; So until next FOTD, take care, and don't lose the faith.
