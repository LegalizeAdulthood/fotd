; FOTD -- June 26, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yesterday's FOTD picture was named "His and Hers".  But because 
; I inadvertently substituted a space band for an underscore 
; between the words 'and' and 'hers', the word 'hers' did not 
; appear when the parameter file was loaded into Fractint, and a 
; great inequality was done to women.  Since yesterday's image was 
; named "His and Hers" for no reason at all, today's image can 
; also be named for no reason at all.  And so that justice might 
; prevail, I have named today's image "Hers and His", with the 
; feminine aspect in first place.
; 
; The image is a scene in the parent fractal that results when 0.7 
; parts of Z and 0.7 parts of Z^5 are combined and C is added.  
; This parent resembles a distorted M-set with its nose pointed 
; southeast and its butt pointed northwest.  Some distance beyond 
; its butt lies a string of Julia-like open circles.  Today's 
; scene lies on a filament on the shore of one of the larger 
; circles.
; 
; To produce the strange effect, the scene was rendered with the 
; outside set to 'fmod' and the inside set to 'bof61'.  The inside 
; part of the image consists of the interior of the central midget 
; as well as the egg-shaped areas.  I used these non-standard 
; fills because when rendered in the normal manner, the image is 
; downright dull.
; 
; When the time arrived to rate the scene, I saw a picture that 
; had been rescued from an abysmal rating of 3 or so and raised to 
; an image that was actually a little above average.  I rated 
; today's image at a 6.
; 
; The render time comes in at under 3 minutes on my tired-out 
; fractal machine.  It downloads in even less time from the FOTD 
; web sites, which can be accessed at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Wednesday brought another typical 93F 34C summer day to Fractal 
; Central.  The sun was hot, the humidity was high, the wind was 
; light, and the air was polluted.  It was just the kind of day to 
; bring out the laziness in the fractal cats, who spent the entire 
; afternoon sleeping on the lawn chairs in the shade of the holly 
; trees.  Today will be a hotter repeat.
; 
; It will also be a repeat for me.  I don't have much work to 
; finish, but the little bit I do have must be finished today.  
; Until next FOTD, take care, and the world is filled with unseen 
; fractal wonders.
