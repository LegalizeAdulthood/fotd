; FOTD -- June 16, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Things are far more settled today here at Fractal Central, 
; though city workers and home-owners are still cleaning up where 
; the flash flood struck on Friday at the bottom of the fractal 
; hill.  The only problem here inside F.C. is a huge backlog of 
; work, which must be cleared away before things will be totally 
; back to fractal normal.
; 
; Today's fractal is named "Vision of a Square".  I gave it this 
; name because the square in question, which is delineated by the 
; blue area, is not immediately apparent, and gradually appears in 
; the awareness, almost like a mystical vision.  But even if the 
; square eludes detection, the graceful filaments are worth a name 
; in themselves.
; 
; The parent fractal adds together 3.9 negative parts of Z^2 and 
; Z^3 before adding 1/C.  The fractal produced by this formula is 
; a grossly oversized, double-lobed thing that requires several 
; outzooms before it fits on the screen.  Today's scene is located 
; in a small bay on an inland shoreline near the X-axis of this 
; parent.
; 
; Much of the image consists of bof61 inside fill.  This fill is 
; the reason that the central midget is so poorly defined.  But 
; despite the poorly-defined central midget, the image rates a 7.  
; The 6-minute render time can be avoided by downloading the 
; completed image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Though it remained cloudy, only a few drops of rain fell here at 
; Fractal Central on Sunday.  The neighborhood Father's Day cook-
; outs went as planned, and the fractal cats enjoyed a pleasant 
; afternoon outdoors in the temperature of 81F 27C.  They needed 
; no treats of tuna to put them in good moods.
; 
; Today is promising to once again be pleasant.  But I'll not be 
; able to say for sure that it will be pleasant until the day and 
; the work are behind me.  Until then, anything can happen and 
; usually does.  Until tomorrow, when the next FOTD will appear, 
; take care, and be wary of stray fractals.
