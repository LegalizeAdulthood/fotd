; FOTD -- June 28, 2003 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates only a 4.  This sub-standard rating is 
; justified because the image has a flaw known in the world of 
; visual art as muddiness.  Muddiness results when colors with too 
; great a difference in brightness are mixed together.  Today's 
; image has exactly this flaw, which earns it the 4.  Some of the 
; muddiness can be eliminated by changing the inside color from a 
; flat black 00 00 00 to something like a grey 40 40 40.  But 
; nothing can save a fractal picture like today's, which is flawed 
; from the start by too much detail.
; 
; I named the picture "A Merry Land".  The name has nothing to do 
; with the fact that Fractal Central happens to be located in the 
; state of Maryland.  I gave it the name because, despite the 
; muddiness, there is a kind of merriness in the picture.
; 
; The generating formula takes the tiniest bit of Z^100 and adds 
; Z^(-2) to it.  Even though the portion of Z^100 is only 1/10^32, 
; this tiny bit overwhelms the Z^(-2) and creates an oversized 
; lopsided hole filled with a triangle.  Today's scene is located 
; near the tip of the western arm of the triangle.
; 
; Like yesterday's image, today's is slow.  It takes over one hour 
; to render on my machine.  The best way to see the image is to 
; wait an hour or so for Paul and Scott to render it, and avoid 
; the hassle of rendering it yourself by downloading the completed 
; GIF image from one of the FOTD web sites:

; 
; The sun and temperature of 90F 32C on Friday here at Fractal 
; Central was just what the dynamic fractal cats needed to put 
; them in a good mood.  They spent the afternoon romping in the 
; yard and lounging on the porch.  At one point the cat from two 
; doors down the hill appeared, lurking behind the holly trees.  
; Luckily, I was there to restrain Tippy, who was ready to start a 
; fight.  The day ended peacefully, with a pair of exhausted but 
; hungry cats ready to eat and sleep.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy and cooler.  I've got enough work to 
; keep me busy an hour or so, and there is always the grass to 
; trim.  It looks like it will be another normal day here at F.C.  
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care 
; and life could be a never-ending fractal.
