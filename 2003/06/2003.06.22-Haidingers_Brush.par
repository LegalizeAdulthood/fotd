; FOTD -- June 22, 2001 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image reminds me of Haidinger's brush, and that is what 
; I named it.  Haidinger's brush is not a cleaning device or 
; scrubbing device; it is almost like a fractal.  The brush is not 
; a real brush at all; it is a figure seen at the center of the 
; field of vision when gazing at a smooth and polarized source of 
; light, such as the clear blue sky at 90 degrees from the sun.
; 
; This ability of the unaided human eye to detect polarized light 
; is little known, but most certainly does exist and can be 
; scientifically demonstrated.  Though it is not actually a sixth 
; sense, it comes rather close.  A far more complete discussion 
; can be found on the internet at:
; 
;           <http://polarization.com/haidinger/haidinger.html>
; 
; As a fractal, today's image rates a 6.  It was created by 
; subtracting 1.2 parts of Z^(-0.93) from 1.2 parts of Z^(0.93) 
; and adding (1/C) instead of plain C.  The resulting parent 
; fractal has a large bay with a very extended, drawn-out shore-
; line dotted with tiny bays.  Today's scene is located on one of 
; the arms of a 'star' at the tip of the filament extending from 
; one of these bays.
; 
; The image is not all that different from what would be found in 
; the classic Mandelbrot set at a similar location.  Therefore, I 
; could rate it no higher than an average 5.  But this is the 
; *FOTD* average.  And the FOTD average is well above the average 
; of all fractals  :-)  so the image is worth a quick look, if not 
; the 23-minute render time.
; 
; That quick look may be found at Paul's web site:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or at Scott's site:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Scattered thunder-showers started popping up in the local area 
; around 4pm on Saturday, finally joining together into one 
; monster storm at 7pm, which flooded many sections on the east 
; side of town.  Fractal Central, which is on the east side, 
; escaped with only a puddle of water in the basement; others were 
; not so lucky.  Before the rain arrived, the temperature reached 
; 73F 23C, and there was enough sun to give the cats a satisfac-
; tory day in the grass.  The forecast for today is for improved 
; conditions.  We'll see what happens . . .
; 
; Today I find myself going on another of those trips to examine 
; the old junque that others have discarded.  Departure time is in 
; an hour, so until next FOTD, take care, and the best is yet to 
; come.
