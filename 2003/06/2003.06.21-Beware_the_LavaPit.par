; FOTD -- June 21, 2001 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; What do you get when you mix some Z^(1.1) with some Z^(-1.1)?  
; A pit of boiling hot lava of course.  I named the image "Beware 
; the Lava Pit".  Actually, I should have named it "Beware the 
; Magma Pit" since the scene is underground, and molten rock is 
; known as magma until it reaches the surface.  Only then is it 
; called lava.
; 
; When the time came to rate the image, I studied it several 
; minutes before realizing that it was merely an average image.  
; The rating of 5 is average.  There's nothing wrong with being 
; average, it's just that I like my FOTD images to be above 
; average, and the greater the number of above-average images I 
; post, the higher the standard of average becomes.
; 
; One thing that does not change however is the average render 
; time of my FOTD's, which currently stands around 12 minutes on 
; my tired, worn-out P200 machine with the exhaust fan that needs 
; to be nudged before it starts turning.  When I forget to nudge 
; it, the smell of the over-heated power-supply unit soon reminds 
; me to give it its nudge.
; 
; Today's image requires 25 minutes to complete on my machine.  It 
; will finish faster on faster machines.  But the fastest way of 
; all to see the lava pit is to download the completed GIF image 
; from one of the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Heavy rain fell during the day Friday here at Fractal Central.  
; The cats, who were confined to the indoors, turned sullen in the 
; afternoon.  Several treats of tuna were needed to restore their 
; spirits.  Today is starting with a bit of sun, but heavy storms, 
; and perhaps hail, are due this afternoon.  I doubt that the cats 
; will have a good day.
; 
; If the grass dries enough, I'll trim it today.  If not, I'll let 
; it grow another couple inches.  In any case, I'll visit Fractal 
; Land to track down the next fractal.  Until next time, take 
; care, and beware.
