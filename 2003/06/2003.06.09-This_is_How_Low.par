; FOTD -- June 09, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the bottom of the barrel, way down to 
; the land of Z^(1.009)+C.  At this abysmal depth, the sand-like 
; fractal material has reached such a high maxiter that it is 
; effectively beyond reach.  But the areas of extreme discontinu-
; ities continue to multiply, and though still of a very high 
; maxiter, are within reach for those with patience.  The 'recip' 
; function was an accident.  The 'floor' function works best with 
; this formula, but the image is good, and who's complaining.
; 
; In today's fractal, the coloring makes the picture.  A very 
; broad palette is necessary to add definition to an otherwise 
; featureless image, but when this is done, a series of feathery 
; curving arms appears.  I have named the image "This is How Low" 
; because its exponent of Z is about as close to unity as it is 
; possible to come and still get something other than an empty, 
; featureless circle.
; 
; I have rated the image at an average 5, more for mathematical 
; interest than for artistic worth.  If it were not for the render 
; time of over 2 hours on my machine, the image might have rated 
; a 6.  But don't be put off by the slowness of the image.  Give 
; Paul and Scott a couple hours to render the image, then visit 
; their web sites to download the completed image.  Paul's site is:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Scott's is:

;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The rain held off on Sunday here at Fractal Central.  Despite a 
; temperature that never reached 70F 21C, the fractal cats had a 
; good day.  When the cats are happy, I'm happy also, so I also 
; had a good day.  Today is actually starting with some sun, and 
; no rain is forecast, making another good day near certain.
; 
; Once the day's work is behind me, assuming the cats are happy, 
; my day should once again be good.  Tomorrow's FOTD might launch 
; out in a new direction, or it might be a return to the 
; MandelbrotMix4 formula and the midgets it draws.  To see what 
; happens, check back in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; hope for the best.
