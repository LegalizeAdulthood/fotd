; FOTD -- June 20, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When a discontinuous function is iterated, a discontinuous 
; fractal results.  Most of the FOTD fractals that are generated 
; by the MandelbrotMix4 (or 2) formula are discontinuous, and 
; indeed, the discontinuities often create the image.
; 
; Today's image however is continuous.  It combines 0.3 parts of 
; Z^(-2) with 0.3 negative parts of Z^4 before it adds (1/C).  The 
; resulting parent fractal is an oversized area of chaos, rotated 
; 45 degrees, which needs two outzooms before it totally fits on 
; the screen.  Near the center are two symmetrical and completely 
; outrageous mutant Mandeloids, with no relation at all to the 
; proper Mandel shape.  But these Mandeloids have no discontinui-
; ties, and that alone makes them interesting.
; 
; Today's scene is located rather deep in one of the less-likely 
; valleys of the eastern Mandeloid.  (In this Mandel-figure, all 
; valleys are unlikely.)  One of my taken-for-granted midgets is 
; located as usual at the center, though it is too small to occupy 
; more than a few pixels.  But the midget is not the center of 
; attention.  That honor goes to the elements that fill the image, 
; and delineate a kind of cogwheel.
; 
; These elements are almost totally disconnected, but they are 
; unbroken.  Not a single discontinuity mars the wholeness of the 
; image.  This is how the fractals with fractional negative 
; exponents would appear if a way could be found to eliminate the 
; discontinuities, a task that is impossible but still fun to 
; speculate about.
; 
; I named today's image "Pure Wholeness" because that's what it 
; is.  Too bad I could rate it no higher than a 6, but even a 6 is 
; at least slightly above average.
; 
; Running the parameter file, with its render time of almost 9 
; minutes, is one way of admiring the wholeness of today's image.  
; A second way is to download the completed GIF image from one of 
; the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Clouds were plentiful here at Fractal Central on Thursday, but 
; the temperature reached 81F 27C and the rain held off until 
; nightfall.  These pleasant conditions enabled the cats to enjoy 
; several hours in the yard and enabled me to save a can of tuna.
; 
; Today should be a wetter repeat.  If I get the routine work done 
; early enough, and if the rain does hold off, it might turn out 
; to be another good day for both cats and humans.  But to finish 
; I must start, so until the next FOTD in 24 hours, take care, and 
; study them as we might, we will never understand all there is to 
; know about fractals.
