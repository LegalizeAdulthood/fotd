; FOTD -- June 30, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's trip into Fractal Land takes us to the parent fractal 
; created by subtracting Z^(1.1) from Z^(-1.1) and adding (1/C).  
; This parent fractal should more properly be called the parent 
; fractals because the entire parent consists of two similar sized 
; Mandeloids sitting side by side.  The Mandeloid on the right is 
; fairly intact, with all its bays and valleys, while the one on 
; the left is only half there.  Its main bay, along with other 
; accessories, is missing.  Today's image is located in the East 
; Valley area of the intact Mandeloid on the right.
; 
; I named the image "Washboard" when I noticed the square ribbed 
; effect around the central midget.  This ribbed effect is due 
; entirely to the unavoidable discontinuities in the image.  It is 
; a good example of discontinuities leading to a positive result.  
; And BTW, a washboard is an object that was used to wash clothes 
; before we had washing machines.
; 
; The image rates a 6, which is just the slightest above the 
; average of all my fractals.  If I had compared it to only the 
; FOTD fractals, it would rate around a 4.  I really should 
; broaden my rating system, since nearly every FOTD image rates 
; between a 4 and a 7.  But doing so would distort the record.  
; Perhaps I'll shift to a 0-to-100 scale and rate my images as 
; though they were a school test.  We'll see what I think about 
; the idea.
; 
; With a render time of 5 minutes, (and a rinse time of 3 minutes) 
; the washboard cycle is a fast one.  Downloading the completed 
; image from one of the FOTD web sites:

; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; is even faster.
; 
; Except for being a bit too warm for comfort, Sunday was a near 
; perfect day here at Fractal Central, especially for cats.  The 
; rain held off, and the warm sun, gentle breezes and temperature 
; of 88F 31C gave them a most enjoyable day in the yard.  Of 
; course, at their age, enjoyment for cats means sleeping as much 
; as possible.  Today is promising to be a repeat.  With a little 
; bit of luck, the duo will have another great day.
; 
; And with a bit more luck I'll finish the day's work by noon, 
; leaving lots of time to find the next FOTD.  Until that next 
; FOTD appears, take care, and the meaning of life could be 
; encoded in a fractal.
