; FOTD -- September 07, 2003 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I must be developing amnesia.  When I checked my e-mail box this 
; morning I found about a dozen letters from different people 
; telling me that I was great last night but could still use some 
; improvement.  Then there were four more people who had seen my 
; profile online and wanted to meet me.  There were four who had 
; met me in a chat room.  I had three letters that gave the 
; information I had requested.  And several letters simply said 
; something like 'hey' or 'hi' or 'how're ya', or 'Jane told me 
; you are too small', or the most mysterious of all -- 'dgins hebs 
; oihndy fgotushn eod'.  Finally, I wonder why the billing depart-
; ment at Mindspring wanted me to re-submit my credit card number 
; to confirm that the number is correct.  The number has been 
; working as it should for 7 years.
; 
; What has me worried is that I have no memory of being with 
; twelve different people in one night, or of having my profile 
; online.  I have totally forgotten visiting any chat rooms, and I 
; don't remember requesting any information.  I have no memory at 
; all of those many people who sent me greetings.  I also wonder 
; who this Jane is who thinks I am too small.  My height is just 
; about average.  As for that message in a foreign language -- it 
; might be important, but I can't read it.  Finally, I wonder why 
; my latest credit card statement shows a balance of $8,758.63, 
; when last month it was $176.53 and I paid that in full and have 
; charged nothing since then.
; 
; (The first paragraph is true; the second is frivolous.  Every 
; few weeks I need a short rant about spam...)
; 
; ...especially when the FOTD doesn't turn out too well.  For 
; today's image I tried the same trick that worked so well in 
; yesterday's image.  But it didn't work at all in today's image.  
; I named the image A No-Repeat Fractal" because it's apparently 
; impossible to repeat the same trick and get an equally fine 
; result.  I rated the image at a meager 4.
; 
; The image was generated with the MandelbrotMix3a formula, which 
; does nothing but permit 4 different exponents of Z to be 
; combined in different portions, and permits the initial value of 
; Z to be adjusted to a critical value of the formula.  In today's 
; case, zero is a critical value, so the (p5) parameter remains at 
; zero.
; 
; The biggest drawback is the time required to render the image -- 
; over one hour on my machine.  I strongly recommend giving Paul 
; and Scott time to generate the image and post it to their web 
; sites before going there to download the image.
; 
; Paul's site is found at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Scott's is at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Near-perfct weather prevailed once again Saturday here at 
; Fractal Central.  The bright sun, dry grass and temperature of 
; 79F 26C produced near-perfect cats.  They had such a pleasant 
; day in the yard that by the time they came in, they wanted to do 
; nothing but grab a few bites of food and fall asleep.  If they 
; were still kittens, I would say they are at their best behavior 
; when they are sleeping, but now that they are fully mature, they 
; sleep far too much for sleep to be considered their best 
; behavior.
; 
; Today looks to be a repeat of yesterday, so I expect we'll do it 
; all again.  The duo is already romping in the yard.  I'll be 
; back in 24 hours with a new and fresh fractal, not another 
; inferior imitation.  Until then, take care, and be peaceful.
