; FOTD -- September 09, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Long ago, there was a coal-burning ferry that plied the 
; Chesapeake Bay, ferrying cars from Baltimore on the western 
; shore to Love Point on the eastern shore.  The boat was named 
; 'Smokey Joe' because its whereabouts could always be determined 
; by the plume of smoke that constantly rose from its smokestack.  
; The ferry was in operation many years, but went out of service 
; when the bridge across the bay opened.
; 
; I came on the scene too late to ride the ferry, but my father 
; often told of the times he had ridden it on his way to a special 
; fishing spot, the location of which he never made clear.  He 
; described how the plume of smoke from its stack could be seen 
; coming long before the boat itself became visible.
; 
; I never saw the boat in operation, but in my imagination I often 
; tried to picture the smoky ferry moving across the water, 
; trailing its smoke behind it.  For some reason, today's image 
; reminds me of the plume of smoke that I never saw in person.  
; The image is named "Smokey-Joe Midget" in honor of that never-
; seen but much-imagined ferry.
; 
; The formula combines Z^(-8.8) with 8 times as much Z^(-0.88) and 
; adds (1/C) instead of C.  The resulting parent fractal is one of 
; those indescribable things that result when two negative powers 
; of Z are mixed -- a fractal with more valleys than a penguin has 
; feathers.  Today's scene is located at the point where one of 
; these valleys splits into two separate valleys.
; 
; The basic scene with outside=iter was acceptable enough, but I 
; tried the other outside fills before deciding to evaporate the 
; entire scene.  None of the other outside options made an image 
; that was worth the effort.  Then I evaporated the scene by 
; raising the escape radius to one-googol, and applied the various 
; inside options to the blank screen that resulted.  The 'bof61' 
; option worked best, so that's the one I used.
; 
; The end result rates a 6 -- not outstanding, but at least a 
; little above average.  The render time of 8-3/4 minutes is 
; acceptable, but the image may be seen far more quickly by 
; downloading it, already rendered, from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Monday ended in a satisfactory manner here at Fractal Central, 
; with contented cats and up-to-date work.  True, the clouds 
; thickened as the afternoon progressed, but no rain fell, and the 
; temperature of 79F 26C kept things comfortable for the cats.
; 
; Today is starting the same as yesterday.  I hope for another 
; good day.  Until 24 hours from now, when the next FOTD appears, 
; take care, and don't get spammed.
