; FOTD -- September 30, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Having found, or rather created, a spare moment, I used that 
; time to find a very slow fractal, which I could let develop on 
; my fractal machine while I accomplished other things on my other 
; machines.  The fractal took almost 3 hours to complete, and when 
; it was finished, I named it "The Sun and Moon".  I can give no 
; reason for choosing such a name.  Perhaps someone viewing the 
; image can supply a reason.
; 
; The parent fractal is an oversized something, too distorted to 
; be called a Mandeloid, which consists of little more than two 
; prominent valleys.  Today's image is located rather deep in the 
; larger valley.  This valley must be of the 'Seahorse' variety, 
; because the midget I found in it resembles 'Seahorse Valley' 
; midgets more than 'Elephant Valley' midgets.
; 
; When all was said and done, I rated the image at a 7.  But even 
; a 7-rated image is not worth a wait of almost 3 hours.  So I 
; recommend downloading the image from one of the FOTD web sites 
; at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Things are coming along reasonably smoothly here at F.C.  By 
; working long days, I am getting the old work out a little faster 
; than new work is coming in.  And if the present trend continues, 
; things will eventually get caught up.  It is far too early to 
; say when 'eventually' will arrive.
; 
; Monday was a fine early Autumn day here at Fractal Central, with 
; lots of sun and a crisp temperature of 66F 19C.  The fractal 
; cats enjoyed themselves in the yard for two hours in the 
; afternoon, and settled for the evening without a treat of tuna.
; 
; As for me, I still have enough work backed up to keep the 
; 12-hour days going for another week or two.  But the backlog 
; will 'eventually' be cleared and the daily FOTD will resume.  
; Until next new FOTD, whenever that is, take care, and keep 
; checking those old classic FOTD images.
