; FOTD -- September 10, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It appears the booming design business is having an effect 
; on the quality of the FOTD.  For about two weeks I have been 
; unusually busy, and the FOTD fractals have suffered from a lack 
; of attention.  I'm not sure whether this is good news or bad, 
; but I would rather concern myself about a less-than-great FOTD 
; than a lack of money.  The only thing I am certain of is that 
; the FOTD will continue appearing almost every day for the 
; foreseeable future.
; 
; Today's image of a midget surrounded by a brightly glowing aura 
; was created by mixing various portions of Z^2, Z^3, Z^4 and Z^5. 
; I named it "Mystic Mandel Vision" because it reminds me of 
; something a meditating mystic with an interest in fractals might 
; see in his mind while he meditates.
; 
; This particular mystic vision is of only average quality, and 
; it rates only an average 5.  It deserves nothing more.
; 
; Mystical visions are true, though they are not real in the 
; generally accepted sense of the word.  The same is true of 
; fractals.  Much can be learned through mystical visions; much 
; can be learned through fractals.  Much of what is learned 
; through both means has no apparent practical value.
; 
; Today's image requires 27 minutes to render on my tired machine, 
; which is almost 10 years old and still humming.  The image 
; downloads in far less time from the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; With a temperature of 75F 24C and lots of sun, the day remained 
; perfect from noon until night on Tuesday here at F.C., as did 
; the fractal cats.  Even the work went well.  There is no cause 
; for complaint.
; 
; Today is starting the same.  It's almost too good to be true, 
; so check the next FOTD to see what goes wrong.  Until that next 
; FOTD appears in 24 hours, take care, and who says there's a 
; Murphy's law?
