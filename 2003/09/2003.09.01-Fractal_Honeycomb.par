; FOTD -- September 01, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I am sometimes accused of being irrational and against science.  
; Well, some of my world views are irrational, but I am certainly 
; not against science.  I am rather disappointed with science, and 
; particularly with technology, however -- not with the scientific 
; way of doing things but with the way science and technology have 
; been applied.
; 
; Thirty-four years ago, when I was still a young man, we landed 
; the first men on the moon -- probably the greatest human 
; achievement that will happen in my entire lifetime.  And we did 
; it with 40-year-old technology.  The future looked bright back 
; then.  I fully expected to see colonies soon established on the 
; moon, Mars, and perhaps some of the large moons of the outer 
; planets.  But something went wrong.  Instead of pressing onward, 
; we slipped backward into the space shuttle program.  Instead of 
; exploring the solar system, we would continue orbiting earth in 
; circles that go nowhere.
; 
; When it was proposed, the shuttle program was supposed to bring 
; unlimited benefits to mankind.  Other than the Hubble telescope, 
; which has brought some spectacular pictures, but probably could 
; have been equalled by a properly designed ground-based system if 
; the effort had been made, I can see little if any benefit to 
; humanity that has come from over 20 years of circling the earth 
; in these oversized space craft.  And I have yet to hear of any 
; real benefits that will come from the over-priced space station 
; the shuttles are building and supplying.
; 
; When deep space was within our grasp, we turned our backs on it, 
; and turned instead to a glittery vehicle that makes a lot of 
; noise and a lot of news but does nothing of importance that I 
; can see.  Most of the useful artificial satellites in orbit were 
; launched by inexpensive expendable rockets, which never make the 
; news unless one happens to fail.
; 
; The question remains: why did we forget the solar system and 
; devote our energies to orbiting the earth?  Are we afraid?  Was 
; the reason financial?  Did a single person make the decision?  
; Are we being controlled by a vast conspiracy of the huge multi-
; national corporations?  One of the least likely explanations I 
; have seen is that, because we cannot restrain our tendencies to 
; violence, we were ordered to stop venturing beyond the immediate 
; vicinity of earth by the Galactic Federation, an alliance of the 
; various advanced civilizations that inhabit our galaxy.  It 
; sounds laughable, but hey, it's as logical as any other reason I 
; have heard.
; 
; Well, it now looks as though I should think of freezing my body 
; or start hoping for reincarnation if I plan on seeing mankind 
; explore even the solar system, much less the galaxy.  Yes, some-
; times I do get a bit testy with the way we are wasting our 
; resources on this planet.  But I can hardly be blamed.
; 
; Today's fractal, direct from the deepest, most abstract space in 
; existence, vaguely reminds be of a honeycomb.  And so I named it 
; "Fractal Honeycomb".  It is a scene in the fractal that results 
; when 0.2 parts of Z^3 are added to Z^2.  The terraced amber 
; parts of the image are inside stuff rendered by the 'fmod' 
; inside option.
; 
; The rating of a slightly above average 6 seems appropriate; the 
; render time of 21 minutes seems slow.  Relief may be found at 
; the FOTD web sites, where the completed GIF image is posted.  
; Those sites are at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; As I expected, the rain forecasted by the experts failed to 
; appear on Sunday just as it had failed to appear the day before. 
; In the 79F 26C air, the cats had a pleasant day.  Rain is 
; forecast again today, and though the sky now appears more 
; threatening, I won't believe it will rain until rain is actually 
; falling.  The cats hope the experts are wrong again.
; 
; It's labor day here in the USA -- the day on which no one does 
; labor.  And to celebrate the occasion, I will do absolutely 
; nothing.  Fractals are not labor however, and by the time 
; tomorrow arrives, I will have the next fractal ready.  Until 
; then, take care, and avoid fractal dead-ends.
