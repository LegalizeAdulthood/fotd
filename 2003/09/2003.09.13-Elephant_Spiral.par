; FOTD -- September 13, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we recreate the same parent Julibrot that held yesterday's 
; image, but we slice it at one of its other two critical points.  
; This point is entered as the real(p5) parameter.  The Mandeloid 
; that this point draws is shaped quite like the parent Mandeloid 
; of yesterday's image, with the exception that, unlike yester-
; day's parent, today's has an East Valley.
; 
; Today's image is located on the south shore of the East Valley 
; of its parent, in a cut-off island located quite deep in an 
; elephant-trunk spiral.  The image consists of cut-off combina-
; tions of elephant-like features and spirals.  These features 
; inspired the name.
; 
; Something about the image pleases me.  Maybe the image is not as 
; pretentious as some of my FOTD images, maybe it gives a stronger 
; impression of being a real object, but whatever he reason, I 
; have rated it at an above-average 7.
; 
; The rating of 7 makes the slow render time of 54 minutes less 
; extravagant.  But those who would rather have no extravagance at 
; all in their fractals may see the image by downloading it from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The rain set in just after noon here at Fractal Central on 
; Friday, and the temperature reached only a chilly 64F 18C.  The 
; cats managed an hour or so of outdoor time before the rain 
; began, so they were not too irate when they were forced onto the 
; porch and then indoors.  When they came inside, a tuna treat 
; kept them happy.
; 
; But it's raining again this morning, and due to continue almost 
; all day.  How will the dynamic duo adjust?  Check back in 24 
; hours to see.  Until then, take care, and those with fractals in 
; their days live longer and happier lives.
