; F.O.T.D., August 27, 1997 (s_curve)
; 
; Fractal visionaries:
; 
; (Originally posted on the Fractal Art list.)
; 
; While the debate about whether to organize or not to organize 
; grows in intensity, I stand on the sidelines, contentedly 
; continuing to search for fractal images.  I am pretty much 
; neutral on the idea of a fractal artists' guild.  Belonging to 
; such a group would give a certain legitimacy to our fractal art 
; field, but I doubt if such a group would suddenly open the 
; general public's eyes to the wonderful things that numbers can 
; do.
; 
; All too many people disengage their brains when they encounter 
; art.  They judge a painting's worth by how photographically 
; realistic it is, a novel by how sensational it is, and a piece 
; of music by the immediate catchiness of the major scale melody 
; or else by the volume of the percussion.  This natural human 
; aversion to intellectual effort is in my opinion the chief 
; impediment to the wide acceptance of fractal art, and indeed, to 
; the acceptance of all abstract art.
; 
; I have been a member of a similar group, the Graphic Artists' 
; Guild, for several years.  And to be honest, the greatest effect 
; the guild has had in my life to this point has been when I wrote 
; the checks for the membership fee.  If a fractal guild were 
; formed, I would consider the membership fee and what the group 
; might accomplish, before making my decision about joining.
; 
; My fractal today, as promised yesterday, is a figure I 
; discovered in the Julia plane of the (-Z)^1.007 mandeloid.  It's 
; incredible that an exponent so close to unity could produce an 
; image with as much detail as in today's fractal.  But here it 
; is, in all its spiral glory.
; 
; The image will soon be available at:
; 
;       http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html
; 
; and at:
; 
;       http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html
; 
; Tomorrow will be my last FOTD until I return from a well-
; deserved vacation on September 8.  I will try to make it a good 
; one, but my good intentions sometimes are not fulfilled.  So 
; check then to see what fractal turns up.
