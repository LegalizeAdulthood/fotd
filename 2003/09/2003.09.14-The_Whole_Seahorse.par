; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I am constantly fascinated by the concept of the fourth spatial 
; dimension.  Even though four-dimensional space and objects are 
; not visual things, I want to know what a 4-D object looks like 
; when seen all together at a single moment, and not as a 3-D 
; object changing shape over a period of time.
; 
; I want to see an object with a three-dimensional surface.  (The 
; very idea seems absurd.)  I want to see an entire plane of a 
; hypersphere remain fixed in position, with every point rotating 
; on itself as the hypersphere rotates.  I want to see a hyper-
; sphere in a state of double rotation, where only the single 
; point at the center remains fixed, while all other points trace 
; out the circular spirals known as surfaces of double revolution.
; 
; I want to look at the night sky and see not a flat surface with 
; stars scattered over it, but a solid three-dimensional surface 
; with stars embedded all through it.  I want to be on the ocean 
; and see the sphere of the horizon surrounding me in all direc-
; tions including the directions we would call up and down.  And 
; finally, I want to see the Z^2+C Julibrot in its full 4-D glory, 
; with its arms shooting off to infinity.
; 
; There are these things and so much more that I would like to 
; see, but alas, I never will see them, for my visual perception 
; is limited to three dimensions.  I know that 4-D objects are 
; possible because I can create them at will in my computer and 
; examine any section I choose.  As an example, I have created for 
; today's FOTD the 4-D object known as Seahorse Valley.
; 
; As I said, Seahorse Valley is a four-dimensional object, and as 
; such can be examined from many impossible-to-visualize angles, 
; one of which is today's image.  The outer border of today's 
; fractal is in the shape of the familiar Julia set with a C-value 
; of -0.75,0.  This is not unexpected, since the view is turned 
; only one degree from the Julia orientation toward the Oblate 
; orientation.  But the interior of the fractal is filled with 
; strange features unseen in either Mandelbrot or Julia sets.
; 
; This stuff filling the interior of the fractal is an entirely 
; new view of Seahorse Valley.  I named the image "The Whole 
; Seahorse" because it shows more of the Valley than can ever be 
; seen in the M-set alone.
; 
; The narrow straight line cutting down the center of the outer 
; fractal is actually a side view of the two branches of Seahorse 
; Valley coming together.  The extreme maxiter of 1,500,000 is 
; needed to close the gap between the two branches because, from 
; this angle, the branches of the valley have been magnified 57 
; times.
; 
; The orbits of the points in this area are so close to periodic 
; that the periodicity checking must be turned off to avoid false 
; calculation terminations.  Combined with the extreme maxiter of 
; many of the parts of the image, this results in a very slow 
; image, which takes just under an hour to render on my machine.
; 
; Considering the slowness of the image and the fact that I have 
; posted several similar images in the past, I could rate today's 
; image no higher than an average 5.  But it is still an interes-
; ting image with coloring that is not bad, and the completed GIF 
; image will be ready for download from the FOTD web sites within 
; the hour.

; 
; The temperature reached 75F 24C on Saturday here at F.C., but 
; the rain and showers continued all day   The cats made a brave 
; effort to remain in a good mood, but late in the afternoon their 
; frustration got the better of them and a squabble broke out over 
; something minor.  They did a lot of yelling and tail thrashing 
; under the dining room table.  A few blows were thrown, but no 
; damage was done, and the dynamic duo ended the day eating tuna 
; and sulking at each other.  Had it not been for the excitement 
; among the duo, the day would have been uneventful.
; 
; Today is starting sunnier, but lots of clouds are around and 
; there is still a chance of rain.  Only time will tell how it 
; will go.  I plan on another uneventful day, which might or might 
; not happen.  Until next time, take care, and be of stout spirit 
; and slim body.
