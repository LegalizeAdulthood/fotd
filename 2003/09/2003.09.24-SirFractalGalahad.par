; FOTD -- September 24, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's been six days since the last FOTD.  This does not mean 
; that I am losing my enthusiasm for the FOTD.  The reason for the 
; delay is that we had a hurricane here at Fractal Central, and 
; the resulting power failure lasted almost 6 days.  This was bad 
; enough, but the work, which was quite a bit behind to start, got 
; much farther behind during the time I could not work on it.  I 
; am now so far behind that I am in danger of losing customers due 
; to my inability to deliver their jobs on time.
; 
; As a result, this will be the last FOTD discussion until I catch 
; up my other work, a task that will take at least several weeks, 
; and possibly over a month of 12 hour days.  I must work these 
; hours until the pile of 'work to be done', which now holds over 
; one week's work, has been reduced to a manageable size.  In the 
; meantime, I will continue to monitor the Fractint and Philofrac-
; tal lists.  When I find the time, I will inject a few brief com-
; ments.  It will be up to the lurkers to keep the lists alive and 
; active for the duration.
; 
; As a matter of curiosity, my e-mail box held 1181 letters when I 
; checked it for the first time in 6 days.  Most of them were 
; junk, which together took almost 2 hours to download.  The most 
; curious letter informed me in broken english that I had been 
; identified as a money launderer, and for some strange reason, 
; requested my credit card number.  I replied that I always 
; launder my money.  I use mild detergent and luke-warm water.  
; Hot water makes the colors fade.   ;-)   ;-)
; 
; Today's quickie fractal subtracts 1.11 parts of (1/Z) from 
; Z^(1.11), then adds C.  The parent fractal is a distorted M-set 
; rotated -90 degrees, with a curving tail extending from its East 
; Valley, which in this case is on the northeast side of the main 
; bay.
; 
; The scene is located at the end of a broad irregularly curving 
; area of chaos on the main bay side of the northwest branch of 
; the Seahorse Valley of the parent M-set.  I named it "Sir 
; Fractal Galahad".  I have no idea what Sir Galahad has to do 
; with fractals -- the name simply sounds noble in a comical way.
; 
; And the picture looks good, honestly earning its rating of a 7.  
; The render time of 7 minutes is short enough to be reasonable.  
; The download, which is available on the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; is even more reasonable.
; 
; The fractal cats had perhaps the best time of their lives in the 
; 6 days since the last FOTD was posted.  As I predicted, the only 
; casualties the big blow brought to Fractal Central were a 6-day 
; power outage and a yard of broken tree branches.  The dynamic 
; cats watched from their window shelf with interest last Thursday 
; night as the wind roared, trees fell, and the sky was illumina-
; ted by the blue flashes of falling power lines and the distant 
; pops of blowing transformers.  When the next day arrived, the 
; cats were ready for a full day's romp in the yard, which, with 
; nothing but clean-up to do, I was able to give them.  Since 
; then, the weather has been much better, the only exception being 
; a heavy rain that brought more flooding to the area early Tuesday 
; morning.  The cats have had 5 full days in the outdoors with me 
; there to watch over them, making them perhaps the two happiest 
; cats in the world.
; 
; But it's very disconcerting to have so much backed-up design work 
; waiting to be finished.  And with an additional pile of storm-
; associated stuff likely to come in, I'm not as happy as the cats. 
; I guess that, like the linemen of the local electric company, 
; I'll be working 12 and 14-hour days.  I'll be doing it until I 
; clear away enough backed-up work to resume the FOTD in a relaxed 
; manner.  Until next time and next FOTD, whenever that is, take 
; care, and see you for certain in the relatively near but not 
; immediate future.
