; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Well, here we go again.  Thanks to the over-zealous media, the 
; local area is near a state of panic about the catastrophic 
; hurricane that is supposedly headed directly this way and due to 
; strike Thursday or Friday.  Both the Maryland and Baltimore 
; emergency centers have been activated.  The local stores are 
; totally sold out of batteries as people buy 20 and 30 at a time 
; to keep their flashlights lit during the week without power that 
; is probably not coming.
; 
; Panicky residents are emptying the home-supply stores of plywood 
; to board up their windows against the hurricane winds that are 
; probably not coming.  Canned goods and toilet tissue are flying 
; off the grocery store shelves, but I am doing little but 
; watching.  I have seen these false alarms often enough to feel 
; reasonably certain that we will have no hurricane and very 
; possibly not even a storm.
; 
; But the devilish side of me still takes wicked delight in seeing 
; the weather people, TV news people, emergency officials, and the 
; general public make fools of themselves preparing for something 
; that will not happen.  One of these days I may be wrong, one of 
; these days I may be sorry that I did not prepare, but in over 40 
; years that day has yet to arrive, and I have saved probably 
; thousands of dollars.  (BTW, I do not recommend my reckless 
; approach to others.)
; 
; Being involved with the media hype, I spent little time in 
; fractal land yesterday, but I did manage to find a fractal in 
; the figure that results when negative portions of Z and Z^3 are 
; combined.  This parent fractal resembles an angel, much as the 
; parent of yesterday's image did, though today's angel has fewer 
; wings and a far less impressive halo.
; 
; Today's image is located at the edge of one of the many needle-
; like valleys in its parent fractal.  I named it "FMOD Mandeloid" 
; as a description and also because I put no effort into finding a 
; better name.  As the name implies, the image was colored with 
; the outside=fmod option.
; 
; When the time came to rate the image, I could give it no more 
; than a 5.  A fractal that has so little effort put into it can 
; hardly be considered above average.  The render time of 21 
; minutes is a bit slow for an image of average quality.
;

; 
; is recommended.
; 
; The weather Monday here at Fractal Central featured showers 
; and heavy thunder-storms.  The heaviest rains missed F.C., but 
; with near an inch (2cm) of rain, it was wet enough to keep the 
; dynamic fractal cats confined to the indoors for the day, unable 
; to enjoy the temperature of 79F 26C.  They eased their frustra-
; tion by burying their noses in the tuna that appeared several 
; times in their food dishes.
; 
; Today is starting very sunny and pleasantly cool.  It looks like 
; a perfect day coming.  I must finish a bit of design work and 
; finish thinking about the non-preparations for the big hurricane 
; that most likely will never arrive.  Until next time, take care, 
; and doctors might bury their mistakes, but weather people put 
; them on the front page.
