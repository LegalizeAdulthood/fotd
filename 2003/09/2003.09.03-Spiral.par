; FOTD -- September 03, 2003 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When I opened my e-mail box this morning, I found, among all the 
; offers of more length, a letter informing me that I had just won 
; 13-million dollars, or was it euros, in the European Lottery.  
; This is strange, since I never bought a ticket.  But I'm not 
; questioning that aspect.  The letter then asked for my bank 
; account number so that the money I had won could be deposited in 
; my account.  I replied, requesting that the lottery commission 
; send a check instead.  As soon as the check arrives, I shall 
; retire and devote the rest of my days to exploring the world of 
; fractals.  I wonder how long it will be before the check arrives.
; 
; As for today's fractal, it is worth about as much as I am going 
; to be enriched by winning a lottery I never entered.  (Could 
; anyone be gullible enough to actually reply to such letters?)  I 
; gave today's image a courteous rating of a 3.  Actually, it 
; might be closer to a 2.  The image is so poor because I had no 
; time to work on it.  An unexpected rush job came in on Monday 
; and kept me busy until after midnight.  I'm still not quite 
; caught up.
; 
; Having no time to find a new fractal, I turned to one I 
; generated yesterday, when I saw a message on the Fractint list 
; that 7-armed spirals are a rarity in fractals.  I had not 
; realized that such spirals were rare, and to see if this were 
; so, I went to a period-7 bud of the Mandelbrot set and drew the 
; Julia set of that area.  Then, for a bit of added interest, I 
; double rotated the image 0.1 degree from the julia direction and 
; got my 7-armed spiral, with a vague hint of Mandelbrot buds in 
; the background.
; 
; The picture had potential, but then the work came in and I had 
; no time to color it properly.  I leave the colors as they were 
; when I had to stop working on it.  I named the image "Spiral", 
; and used it as FOTD for today.  I might have done better not 
; having a FOTD for today at all, but having gone this far, I am 
; not going to scrap it now.
; 
; The render time of 18 minutes is too slow for such a question-
; able image.  I advise downloading the finished GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The Tuesday temperature of 84F 29C here at Fractal Central was 
; fair enough, but there was little sun.  The occasional sprinlkes 
; of rain were not enough to wet a person, but made the grass too 
; wet for the sensitive paws of the dynamic cats.  As a result, 
; they had a bad day and needed their evening treat of tuna to 
; restore their good moods.
; 
; Today is starting cloudy, cool, foggy, drizzly, with occasional 
; sprinkles of rain.  It is sure to be another bad day for the 
; duo.  For me, I've still got that left-over work to catch up on. 
; So until next FOTD, take care, and don't get twisted up in an 
; endless spiral.
