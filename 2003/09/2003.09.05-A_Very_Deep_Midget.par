; FOTD -- September 05, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The work was still hectic here at Fractal Central on Thursday, 
; but things calmed enough in the afternoon for me to post a short 
; reply to the list and find an 'automatic' fractal in the 
; Mandelbrot set.
; 
; Today's image takes us where many have ventured previously -- to 
; the tip of the negative stem of the Mandelbrot set.  And when I 
; say the tip, I mean the tip.  The magnitude of the image is 
; 3x10^58, and there are 29 consecutive 9's following the 1 and 
; the decimal point in the X-coordinate of the scene.
; 
; Since the cut-off point is set to 2, today's image is almost 
; exactly on the cut-off point.  The rays radiating from the 
; central midget are a direct result of its being so close to the 
; cut-off point.
; 
; The image rates only a 5, held down by the hackneyed nature of 
; the area in which it lies.  Fresher scenes might be found at the 
; tips of some of the other filaments, especially near the cut-off 
; points.
; 
; I named the image "A Very Deep Midget" as a description.  It is 
; certainly a fair name, because, unless I am mistaken, the scene 
; is the second deepest of all the FOTD images.
; 
; The render time of 19 minutes is quite fast for such a high 
; magnitude image calculated with arbitrary precision math.  
; The X-axis symmetry helps a lot here.  Whether the result is 
; worth the wait is open to individual opinion.  My opinion is 
; that a more reasonable method of viewing the scene would be to 
; download it from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Though the temperature on Wednesday reached a very comfortable 
; 77F 25C, it was another disappointing day for the cats here at 
; fractal headquarters.  The sprinkles that fell off and on 
; through the entire day culminated in a torrential downpour at 
; 7pm, accompanied by thunder.  But by that time the cats had 
; already given up all hope of outdoor fun and satisfied them-
; selves with a tuna treat.  When an even stronger storm arrived 
; around midnight, they watched the rain cautiously, until a close 
; lightning strike and a loud bang of thunder sent them scurrying 
; for cover.
; 
; Thursday began with steady rain, which ended at midday, leaving 
; the skies leaden gray for the rest of the day.  The temperature 
; of 75F 24C was fair enough, but fractal cats need dry grass in 
; which to romp, so more tuna was needed.
; 
; Today is starting much better.  It is sunny, cool and dry.  Can 
; the dynamic duo actually have a good day after a long string of 
; bad ones?  Check back tomorrow to see.  As for me, the load of 
; work is still heavy, so I'd best get busy.  Until tomorrow, take 
; care, and keep your spirits up when the rain comes down.
