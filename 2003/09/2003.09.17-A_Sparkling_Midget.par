; FOTD -- September 17, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; This morning at Fractal Central features a plethora of junk 
; e-mail and media hype.  One of the junk e-mails actually had a 
; subject line that got me to open it.  The line was 'you left 
; your umbrella'.  Since I recently lost an umbrella, I thought 
; the letter was from some good samaritan who had found it and 
; wanted to return it.  I never stopped to wonder how the sender 
; had known not only the person who had left the 4-dollar 
; umbrella, but his e-mail address as well.  When I opened the 
; e-mail, I saw the usual gibberish that results when an html 
; document is opened in text mode.  I have yet to fathom what a 
; lost umbrella has to do with selling a low-interest loan.
; 
; Then there is the current local weather forecast, which has a 
; hurricane watch in effect for Thursday and calls for winds of 
; 35-40mph.  Hurricane winds start at 75mph.  I could see a storm 
; warning, but a hurricane watch . . .?  I guess a hurricane 
; situation is remotely possible.  The local TV outlets have of 
; course gone into overdrive.  By Friday morning, when the storm 
; has just passed its mini-peak, they will probably be frantically 
; searching for a fallen tree and showing rain water flowing down 
; the gutters.
; 
; So much for the local nonsense.  Today's image was created by 
; combining decreasing portions of Z^2, Z^3, Z^4 and Z^5.  The 
; resulting Julibrot figure was then sliced at a minor critical 
; point, which drew a tiny Mandelbrot set located well off to the 
; west of the default screen.  This M-set is rotated 180 degrees 
; and is surrounded by tiny dots, each of which contains a 
; universe of M-sets.
; 
; These M-sets are unusual in that they have basically no patterns 
; around them, but are surrounded instead by flat iteration bands 
; containing sparse clouds of star-like points.  I have named 
; today's image "A Sparkling Midget" because it is surrounded by 
; little other than widely scattered stars.
; 
; The coloring was done using the usual equal-iteration bands 
; method.  The other outside coloring options give more detail to 
; the image.  In fact, some of them give too much detail, but I 
; wanted to show the basic star-like blandness of today's scene, 
; so I chose the standard outside=iter option.
; 
; The image rates a 6, which is not bad for such a bland picture.  
; It renders in 3 minutes, which is even better.  Best of all, it 
; downloads in one minute or so from . . . 
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather remained perfect throughout the day here at Fractal 
; Central on Tuesday.  Not a single cloud was seen all day, the 
; wind was light, and the temperature reached 77F 25C.  The 
; dynamic fractal cats made the most of the perfection by spending 
; several hours in the yard.  At the end of the day, no tuna was 
; needed.
; 
; Today is starting perfect once again, but that hurricane is 
; still lurking in the vicinity.  Stay tuned to see what develops 
; in the next few days.  Until tomorrow's FOTD, take care, and try 
; to be at ease when nature misbehaves.
