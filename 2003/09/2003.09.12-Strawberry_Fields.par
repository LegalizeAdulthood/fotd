; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today is starting on an up note: there were less than 100 spam 
; e-mails in my emailbox when I checked a while ago.  But at the 
; same time, there is a down note.  I have not yet received that 
; apology from the administrator, if one exists, of the fracpro-
; grammers list that I am waiting for before I re-subscribe.  No 
; matter, there is no noticeable decrease in the number of letters 
; I am receiving from the list.  More ominously, I am starting to 
; receive returned mail from the Fractint list that I never sent 
; out.  Since I have no sneaky viruses or worms in my system that 
; could send out e-mail without my knowledge, and I never use the 
; programs that get infected by these critters, we'll see where 
; this 'returned mail' leads.  Now on to the fractal for today.
; 
; Today's image is named "Strawberry Fields" not because I like 
; the music of the Beatles, which I rather do, but because the 
; phrase simply came into my head while I studied the image in 
; search of a name.  I guess the pinkish terraces inspired the 
; name.
; 
; The parent fractal is a distorted Mandeloid with no East Valley, 
; lying in the proper orientation, with X-axis symmetry.  Unlike 
; the classic M-set however, the parts of this Mandeloid are not 
; connected, and it is surrounded by a cloud of tiny isolated 
; midgets, every one of which, with the exception of its mirror 
; image, is different.
; 
; The formula subtracts Z^2 from lesser portions of Z^4, Z^6, and 
; Z^8.  This combination produces a fractal with three critical 
; points, one of which is located at Z=0,0.  The remaining two 
; critical points, around Z=+-0.77, produce nearly but not exactly 
; identical Mandeloids, which might hold some interesting scenes 
; and might be worth investigation.
; 
; The largest satellite midget of today's parent fractal is 
; located on the negative X-axis.  Curiously, this midget is 
; rotated 180 degrees, so that its East Valley is on its west 
; side.  Today's scene is found near a larger midget in the 
; interior of the north branch of the Seahorse Valley of the very 
; large satellite midget.
; 
; My standard rendering method, where the outside=iter, produces a 
; fair enough image, but the outside=tdis option that I used does 
; a little better.  When rating the image, I felt a bit more 
; satisfied with it than usual, and gave it a rating of a 6.
; 
; The parameter file's render time of 14-1/2 minutes is slow.  
; Downloading the completed image from one of the FOTD web sites 
; is fast.  Those sites are:

;          <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Sunny skies, gentle breezes, low humidity, and a temperature of 
; 79F 26C made the cats very happy again on Thursday.  They spent 
; the entire afternoon in the yard, romping and resting.  In fact, 
; they have been getting so much quality time in the yard this 
; past week that they actually seem to be growing bored with it.  
; Perhaps the rain that is forecast for later this afternoon and 
; over the week-end will give them reason to appreciate days such 
; as yesterday.
; 
; As for me -- I must finish a pile of work before I can appre-
; ciate anything, so until next time, take care, and when life 
; serves up a lemon, make lemonade and then blow your top.
