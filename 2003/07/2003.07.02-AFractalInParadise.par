; FOTD -- July 02, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Where do good fractals go when they die?  I would assume, to 
; fractal paradise.  And what do these fractal angels see in 
; paradise?  Glorious fractals of course.  Today's image might 
; not be glorious, but it's been good enough to earn a place in 
; paradise, so I felt justified in naming it "A Fractal in 
; Paradise".
; 
; I looked up the roots of the word 'paradise' in my dictionary, 
; and found that the word is derived from 'pairi', which means 
; 'around', and the word 'daeza', which means 'to build a wall'.  
; I suppose this means that the original paradise was seen as a 
; refuge of unlimited happiness surrounded by a wall strong enough 
; to keep out all unhappiness.
; 
; I might add that anything one could desire must be present in 
; paradise or their happiness would be limited.  I have yet to 
; decide how those such as myself, who enjoy things such as stormy 
; weather, are going to have their storms in a place where the 
; weather, if there is any, is always perfect.  And how could 
; those who want the peace of perfect weather be happy in a place 
; with storms.
; 
; I had best leave the theological discussion to the theologians 
; and move on to the fractal discussion.
; 
; Today's fractal combines Z^(1.25) with Z^(-0.75) and adds (1/C) 
; to make a parent fractal that appears as a Mandeloid rotated 90 
; degrees, with a large area of chaos to its north and east.  
; Today's scene is located in a broken line of chaos that runs 
; down one side of the interior of the unusually small East 
; (south) Valley of this Mandeloid.
; 
; I chose the name of the image when I had a fleeting thought 
; about fractals in heaven, a thought that might make for some 
; active philofractal discussion.  The image itself departs from 
; my usual perfectly symmetrical style and shows some of the non-
; symmetrical surroundings of the midget.  In fact, there are two 
; midgets in the image, with the second being located near the top 
; center of the frame.
; 
; I colored the image, which consists entirely of outside 
; material, with the 'tdis' option.  When colored in the normal 
; 'iter' manner, the image drops one or two rating points.  As it 
; is, the image has nothing in it that would rate it any higher 
; than a 6, regardless of its lofty place in paradise, though the 
; render time of 6 minutes is short enough to be practical.
; 
; As always, those who would rather download a ready-to-view image 
; can find that image on the internet at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fine weather for cats held through the day Tuesday here at 
; Fractal Central.  Lots of sun, light winds, and a temperature of 
; 83F 28C kept the intrepid duo happy from noon until dusk.  Their 
; biggest excitement came when the trash was collected and they 
; ducked for cover in the holly thicket.  Today is starting 
; cloudy, with rain forecast.  Hopefully, the rain will hold off 
; until the cats have had their fun.
; 
; My fun will start when the work ends, which looks to be in about 
; 4 hours.  Until next time and next FOTD, take care, and if 
; paradise is so wonderful, why do so many try so hard to postpone 
; their trip?
