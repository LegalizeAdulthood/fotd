; FOTD -- July 21, 2003 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; We arrived home much later than expected last evening, putting 
; me far behind in the work.  With undone work piled left of me, 
; right of me, before me, and even behind me, I had almost no time 
; to find a proper fractal.  I did find an improper (previously 
; discarded) fractal to act as a stand-in however.  I named it 
; "A Stand-in Fractal" accordingly.
; 
; The parent fractal was produced by calculating a different 
; critical point of the formula used for the 'Antlers' image of 
; July 17.  (Yes, a single formula can have more than one critical 
; point.)  Since I put basically no effort into the image, I could 
; not honestly rate it higher than the lowly 3 it is stuck with.  
; But all is not lost.  With so little competition from today's 
; image, tomorrow's is sure to be better.
; 
; Adding insult to injury is the render time of 36 minutes.  
; Luckily, the image, for what it's worth, is available on Paul's 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and on Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Sunday was a fine day at Fractal Central, with lots of sun and a 
; temperature of 84F 29C.  Unfortunately for the dynamic duo, no 
; one was here to let them out to enjoy the weather, and when we 
; finally did arrive after dark, they were sulky enough to need an 
; extra treat.  The extra treat worked, and they ended their day 
; sleeping peacefully.
; 
; Today is starting well enough, but rain is possible later this 
; afternoon, and there is still a lot of work to finish.  The 
; fractal cats will likely be left to their own entertainment 
; devices.  The fractal human however will need nothing extra to 
; keep boredom away.  Until next FOTD, take care, and be well.
