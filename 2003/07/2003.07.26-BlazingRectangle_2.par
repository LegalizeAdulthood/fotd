; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image we take another look at the rectangle that 
; caught fire in yesterday's image.  That rectangle, which is 
; located in the Z^2.003+C Julia set with a C-value of -1.7435, at 
; the Z-coordinates of 0.00019,0.07388 and at a magnitude of 100, 
; is one of the most curious things I have yet discovered in the 
; world of fractals.
; 
; When viewed as a Julia set, it is as perfect a rectangle as one 
; will find in any random fractal.  But the slightest deviation 
; from the Julia orientation has a devastating effect on it.  A 
; rotational deviation of as much as 1 degree totally destroys the 
; perfection of the rectangular shape and produces a curvilinear 
; quadrilateral such as we have in today's image.  Changing the 
; imaginary part of the C-value even the slightest distance from 
; zero has an even more devastating effect.  The entire rectangle 
; rapidly falls apart into fractal debris and vanishes into the 
; fractal ether.
; 
; Since today's image is another sequel, I have named it "Blazing 
; Rectangle-2".  As an FOTD, it rates an average 5, but hey, the 
; average FOTD is nothing to be sneezed at.  And the render time 
; of 5 minutes is fast enough to make the attached parameter file 
; a near-joy to run.
; 
; Those who prefer the acquisition of their fractals to be total 
; ecstasy may download the completed GIF image file from one of 
; the two FOTD web sites:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Friday, with its brilliant sun and temperature of 86F 30C, 
; turned out to be one of those rare perfect summer days here at 
; Fractal Central.  The fractal cats were in one or their rare 
; near-perfect moods as they passed the afternoon in the yard.  My 
; mood was a bit less than perfect as the work piled up faster 
; than I could accomplish it.
; 
; Today's weather is promising to be less than perfect, but still 
; quite pleasant.  If I can finish the modicum of work by noon, 
; I'll have a pleasant enough day.  And I'm certain to find an 
; interesting fractal before the day ends.  To see that interes-
; ting fractal, check back here in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and is truth a fractal?
