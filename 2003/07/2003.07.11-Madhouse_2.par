; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With the fractal phones still off and on, Thursday was another 
; day of hectic scrambling.  The problem on the line is an 
; intermittent short, and as any repair person knows, this gives 
; Murphy's law a perfect chance to work.  When the repairman is 
; here, the phone works perfectly and he has nothing to repair.  
; If he hangs around an hour, waiting for the problem to re-
; appear, the phone continues working.  But when he leaves . . .  
; Oh well, eventually it will be fixed . . . I hope . . .
; 
; Today's fractal is a very short trip to one of the first 
; fractals of all -- the Mandelbrot set.  The location is the East 
; Valley area of the large midget on the main stem.  Yes, I 
; realize that Julia sets had been known to exist long before Mr. 
; Mandelbrot did his work, but the M-set is the first fractal I 
; knew of, and it will always be the number-one fractal -- the 
; simplest yet most complex fractal of all.
; 
; I named today's image "Madhouse-2", though it is far less 
; disorganized than yesterday's chaotic image.  From the way 
; things are going around here, I expect a few more 'madhouse' 
; images before we move on to better things.  The rating of 4 is a 
; run-of-the-mill rating for a run-of-the-mill fractal.  Luckily, 
; the render time is almost instantaneous.
; 
; The finished GIF image is available for download on the FOTD web 
; sites at:

; 
; and at:

; 
; It stayed cloudy all day Thursday here at Fractal Central.  The 
; clouds held the temperature to a very damp 79F 26C.  The cats 
; had a few pleasant minutes in the yard.  The rest of the time 
; they were sulky.
; 
; With the fractal phones still marginal, I'll have another hectic 
; day.  But if nature permits, I'll return in 24 hours with the 
; next in the unending series of Fractals of the Day.  Until next 
; time, take care, and fractals will work for food.
