; FOTD -- July 01, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we begin the seventh month, yet the exact mid-point of the 
; year does not arrive until noon tomorrow.  In honor of these 
; un-astounding facts, I have created a fractal.  I named the 
; fractal "Fractal of Light".  When I gave the image this name 
; last evening, I did so for a definite reason.  This morning, 
; that reason appears much less persuasive, but the name has 
; already been given, and it will remain.
; 
; The parent fractal was created with the MandelbrotMix3a formula, 
; which mixes together four different powers of Z, but requires 
; that the critical points be calculated by hand.  In today's 
; case, Z^2, 1/Z, Z^3 and Z^4 were combined, and Z was initialized 
; to 3.5059....
; 
; The parent fractal, which has X-axis symmetry, is a Mandeloid 
; rotated 180 degrees, with a large triangular area of chaos 
; beyond its East (or in this case, its West) Valley.  The East 
; Valley itself is split in half, with a very skeletal line of 
; disconnected elements strung down its open center.  Today's 
; scene is located near the edge of one of the smaller elements 
; in this string.
; 
; Because of the skeletal nature of the entire East Valley area, 
; today's image consists mostly of inside areas that have been 
; made visible and given detail by the 'fmod' inside-fill option.  
; I have rated the image at a 6, which is the most common FOTD 
; rating.
; 
; Because it must calculate 4 different powers of Z at every 
; iteration, the M-Mix3a formula is rather slow.  Today's image 
; takes a full 11 minutes to render on my machine.  The wait can 
; be avoided by downloading the completed GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; With a temperature of 91F 33C and lots of sun, Monday was 
; another good cat day here at Fractal Central.  Showers prowled 
; the area in the evening, but none made it to Fractal Central.  
; The intrepid duo passed the afternoon sleeping on the porch and 
; sitting in the shade under the holly trees.
; 
; Today promises to be a slightly cooler repeat.  This is good, 
; because old cats become quite settled in their ways, and prefer 
; good days.  So until next FOTD, take care, and keep a good 
; fractal thing going.
