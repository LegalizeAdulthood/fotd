; FOTD -- July 27, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is a different kind of thing.  It is so 
; different in fact that I don't know what to call it.  It is like 
; nothing I have seen before, and this is why I named it "Nothing 
; in Sight".  I realize that this could raise the philosophical 
; puzzle of whether nothing is actually something, but this is not 
; really a puzzle at all.  When a fish sees a gas bubble rising to 
; the surface, it does not see an absence of water, it sees a real 
; object that, assuming fish understand gravity, defies gravity.  
; For that fish, nothing has literally become something.  And is 
; not a positron nothing more than the lack of a negative charge?
; 
; In today's fractal, we are once again in the vicinity of the 
; blazing rectangle of the past two FOTD's.  But we have rotated a 
; full 90 degrees from the Julia direction and are viewing the 
; scene in the Rectangular direction, where imag(z) and imag(c) 
; are displayed on the screen.
; 
; The image has been rotated and unrotated, stretched and 
; unstretched, skewed and unskewed so far that I have lost track 
; of its undistorted appearance.  Actually, the undistorted image 
; is the distorted view, and the stretching, etc. is necessary to 
; undistort it.  The appearance of X-axis symmetry is illusory.  
; A close inspection will reveal subtle differences.
; 
; The image is more a curiosity than a work of art, and as such 
; can be rated no higher than a rating of an average 5.  (With all 
; the average ratings I give my images, I would make a very poor 
; salesperson.)
; 
; The render time of 5 minutes is within reason.  Downloading the 
; completed image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; is also quite reasonable.
; 
; A hot day Saturday brought out the laziness in the fractal cats. 
; Of course, it takes very little to bring out laziness in old 
; cats.  When the temperature hit 90F 32C, they hit their beds, 
; and stayed there most of the afternoon.  They didn't get active 
; until the sun was gone from the yard, when they took a short 
; stroll to the holly thicket.  Today is supposed to be even 
; hotter, though to me it seems to be starting cooler.  It remains 
; to be seen how the duo will adjust.
; 
; I'm going to adjust by doing as little as possible, except in 
; the world of fractals that is.  Until next FOTD, take care, and 
; I do not believe that physical aliens from space are visiting 
; earth, but why then does it concern me so much when I see others 
; who do believe we are being visited?
