; FOTD -- July 13, 2003 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The telephone repairman is due again in a few hours; the phone 
; is working perfectly today.  The repairman was not here 
; yesterday; the phone was not working yesterday.  I'm sure it's 
; all random chance, but then . . .
; 
; Today's not-so-great image exists in the Z^(sqrt(2))+C 
; Mandeloid, as it appears 30 levels down the logarithmic spiral.  
; This parent fractal is one of the more complex ones to come from 
; this formula, consisting of multiple bays, buds and lengthy 
; filaments.
; 
; Today's scene lies on the longest filament just beyond the point 
; where it is attached to its bud.  While studying the image in 
; search of a name, I thought of how many similar images I have 
; seen, and gave the image the somewhat politically incorrect name 
; "They All Look the Same".
; 
; The rating of 4 is as good as I could do with the image that 
; resulted from the day's less-than-fully-productive effort.  And 
; the 48 minutes it takes to render the image helps not a bit.
; 
; Luckily for those with other things to do, the completed GIF 
; image is available for download at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather was quite pleasant here at Fractal central on 
; Saturday, with lots of sun and a temperature of 86F 30C.  By the 
; time the thunder-storm arrived at 7pm, with its wind and heavy 
; rain, the cats had long since ended their day's romp in the 
; yard, and had finished their evening treats.  Today is starting 
; the same as yesterday, so we'll have to wait to see how things 
; work out for the dynamic duo.
; 
; For me, I plan on a day of rest, but if I happen to get an 
; unexpected burst of energy, I might think about trimming the 
; fractal grass.  Regardless of what happens, I'll return in 24 
; hours with fractal action and maybe more.  Until then, take some 
; care, but not too much care.
