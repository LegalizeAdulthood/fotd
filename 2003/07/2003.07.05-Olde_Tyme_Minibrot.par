; FOTD -- July 05, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD reminds me of the kind of Fractint image that was 
; popular around 10 years ago, when the second edition of "Fractal 
; Creations" was published.  I named it "Olde-Tyme Minibrot" 
; accordingly.  And yes, I realize that 10 years ago is hardly 
; ancient history, but in this era where books are outdated before 
; they hit the bookstands, and operating systems come and go like 
; day and night, it is far enough in the past to be called 
; "Olde-Tyme".
; 
; The parent fractal is an oversized thing with X-axis symmetry, 
; created by subtracting 11 parts of Z^(-2.3) from 11 parts of 
; Z^(-1.7) and adding (1/C).  Today's scene is located in a valley 
; of a lopsided bud lying quite close to the origin.
; 
; The olde-tyme look was achieved by coloring the outside parts of 
; the image with the 'atan' option.  The standard 'iter' coloring 
; results in an image with flat areas of color that are too large 
; to be interesting.
; 
; When the time came to rate the image, I decided on a 6, which is 
; the average of the images good enough to make a FOTD.  The 
; 7-minute render time is short enough to be practical, and even 
; that short wait can be avoided by downloading the finished GIF 
; image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Friday was sunny and hot here at Fractal Central, with a 
; temperature of 91F 33C.  Thunder-storms threatened in the late 
; afternoon, but passed off quickly, permitting the fireworks to 
; go off as scheduled.  The dynamic duo had a pleasant afternoon 
; in the yard, though they got a bit skittish when the fireworks 
; noise started.
; 
; Independence Day has now passed.  It's another hot day, and all 
; else is well.  Until next FOTD, take care, and the past always 
; seems better than today.
