; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; How does one answer the question, "Where is the fourth spatial 
; dimension?"  This, in my opinion, is one of the most puzzling 
; questions that has ever been asked.  We know where it would be 
; if it existed, but it cannot exist.  There is no room for it.  
; Three-dimensional space is all there is.  Yet it does exist.  
; Using numbers, we can take apart and examine 4-D hyperspace as 
; rigorously as we examine three-dimensional space.  I suspect 
; that the inability to perceive 4-D space is a limitation of our 
; awareness, and that the fourth dimension is there all around us, 
; if only we had eyes to see.  How to open our eyes and adjust our 
; numbers is anyone's guess.
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the Z^2.003+C Julibrot.  Julibrots 
; are four-dimensional things that, sliced in one direction give 
; Julia sets and, sliced in another direction, give perturbed 
; Mandelbrot sets.  Of course, being hypersolid, the 4-D Julibrot 
; can also be sliced in oblique directions between the Julia and 
; Mandelbrot directions.
; 
; Today's scene is sliced in a direction only one degree from the 
; Julia direction, but that single degree makes a world of differ-
; ence.  (To see the pure Julia set, change imag(p1) from 89 to 
; 90.)  The Z^2.003+C Mandeloid is shaped almost exactly like the 
; classic Mandelbrot set, whose formula is Z^2+C, the major change 
; being along the negative stem, which has split into an infinity 
; of curving, infinitely-divided filaments.  The large midget at 
; -1.75 has also started to split, and today's scene is located in 
; the East Valley of this midget, which has broadened into a much-
; divided wedge-shaped thing.
; 
; I have given the image the name "Four-Dimensional Scene", which 
; is a fair description.  But I am undecided on the worth of the 
; picture, which comprises all there is of the fractal.  Sometimes 
; I think it is worth an 8, then I view it again and see an image 
; worth only a 4.  The image will likely go unrated.
; 
; The modest render time of X minutes can be avoided by download-
; ing the finished GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Though it was quite humid, the temperature rose no higher than 
; 84F 29C and no rain fell here at Fractal Central on Wednesday, 
; giving the dynamic fractal cats a most pleasurable day.  The 
; good weather also helped conserve the stressed tuna population, 
; since no treat was necessary.
; 
; Today is promising to be a slightly less humid repeat.  I expect 
; a repeat from the fractal cats.  More good news is that the work 
; shelf is filling up.  And the best news of all is that I shall 
; return in 24 hours with another glorious fractal.  Until then, 
; take care, and when I started the FOTD on the Fractal-Art list 
; in April of 1997, I expected to keep it going maybe a week or 
; two.
