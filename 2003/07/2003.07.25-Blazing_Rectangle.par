; FOTD -- July 25, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After discovering that the fourth spatial dimension was in my 
; back pocket, I went searching.  Maybe I searched in the wrong 
; pair of pants, but I suspect that the extra dimension slipped 
; off into hyperspace while I was not looking, and has escaped for 
; good.  What a disappointment -- having a visualization of the 
; fourth dimension so close and then losing it.  I guess I'll 
; never see a hypersphere in the condition of double rotation, or 
; a pseudosphere in its infinite entirety.
; 
; Today's image appears to be rotating.  It is a slightly enlarged 
; and distorted view of a small part of yesterday's image, on 
; which I have used a more flexible Fractint generating formula so 
; that I would have more angles to examine.
; 
; The angle of today's slice is once again very close to, but not 
; exactly, the Julia direction.  That slight rotation explains the 
; "Blazing Rectangle" name.  The feature in the center of today's 
; image has a roughly rectangular shape, but it is not rectangular 
; enough to justify the word 'rectangle'.  Where then is the 
; rectangle?
; 
; The rectangle is actually very close, but it is hiding.  To see 
; the near-perfect rectangle, change both parts of the p1 and the 
; p2 parameters to exactly 0.5 and re-render the image.  It takes 
; only a minute or two.  Now the rectangle is visible, revealed in 
; all its near-perfect glory at the center of the frame.
; 
; Actually, I easily might have used the pure Julia version of 
; today's scene as the FOTD of the day, but the distorted version 
; has more action, and the pure Julia version doesn't appear to be 
; blazing.
; 
; I rated the image at a 6, which equals a bit above average.  
; After searching carefully, I could find little that has not been 
; seen before.  (Originality in doing old things rates high with 
; me.)  The render time of 2 minutes is unusually short, due 
; mostly to the low magnitude of only 44.
; 
; Those who download their FOTD images will find today's posted as 
; usual to Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; A perfect day on Thursday, with a temperature of 81F 27C, 
; produced perfect cats.  Tippy was a bit too perfect when he 
; viciously attacked my ankle like he used to do long ago when he 
; was still a kitten and wanted to be played with.  To see if he 
; was feeling playful, I took the feather on a string from its 
; shelf, where it had rested untouched for several years, and to 
; my surprise, Tippy actually leaped around chasing it.  Thomas 
; watched the activity with interest, but weighing over 17 pounds, 
; declined to participate.  At the end of the day, both Tippy and 
; Thomas were exhausted, and needed no additional treat before 
; settling down for the night.
; 
; Today looks like it will be a repeat.  I'll make a full report 
; in tomorrow's FOTD, which will appear in 24 or so hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and what do you call someone who wastes his 
; time talking about stuff he does not believe in?
