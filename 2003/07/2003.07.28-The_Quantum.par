; FOTD -- July 28, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's FOTD we return to a formula that has not been used 
; for over a year.  This formula, which draws nothing but empty 
; circles, is named 'Mystic2'.  I gave it this name because it is 
; a near miracle that worthwhile fractals can come from it.
; 
; But miracles sometimes do happen, and when we look at today's 
; image, we are seeing a miracle in progress.  The empty interiors 
; produced by the Mystic2 formula are filled with unseen activity, 
; which can be made visible by active inside fills such as the 
; 'bof61' used in today's image.
; 
; So today's image consists of nothing but inside material.  There 
; is nothing new in this -- the 'evaporated' images that I some-
; times post consist of all-inside material also.  But at least, 
; those 'evaporated' images were once real inside-outside images.  
; Today's image never was real.  It has no connection at all to 
; fractal reality, whatever that is.
; 
; Today's image, with its vaguely-defined, all-seeing eye, is all 
; fuzziness, all uncertainty.  It has no sharp edges.  It reminds 
; me of existence at the quantum level, where nothing is certain 
; but uncertainty itself, and from some of the things I read, even 
; the uncertainty is uncertain.  I see probability clouds, where 
; electrons might or might not exist at any point, and I see 
; atoms, which are more real, but still far from the type of 
; reality we think of when we observe the 'real' world around us.
; 
; Thinking of how our oh-so-solid real world is built of less-than-
; solid blocks, I named today's image "The Quantum".  I then rated 
; it at an above-average 7.  Of course, I am uncertain that this 
; is the most correct rating.
; 
; The 'Mystic2' formula creates far more than the simple fuzziness 
; seen in today's image.  It can create images indistinguishable 
; from the normal equal-iteration-band pictures.  It can create 
; images like nothing seen before.  I have no idea why I use it so 
; rarely.  Maybe I'll devote a month to 'Mystic2' images in the 
; not-too-distant future.
; 
; Today's image renders in 9 minutes, which is a bit slow.  The 
; download from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; will speed things quite a bit.
; 
; Sunday was hot enough here at Fractal Central to satisfy the 
; most ardent fan of high temperatures.  The high temperature of 
; 92F 33C set no record, but combined with the high humidity, it 
; kept the dynamic fractal cats confined to the air conditioned 
; indoors.  They did venture outside briefly just before sunset, 
; but the sound of a can of tuna being opened brought them scur-
; rying inside to eat.
; 
; Today brings a threat of much rain and unhappy cats, so we'll 
; have to see how it goes, and we'll need to have more tuna ready 
; for distribution.  Until next FOTD, which will appear as usual 
; in 24 hours, take care, and live in your entire self.
