; FOTD -- July 20, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image has been named "Somewhere-But Where".  This name 
; was chosen because the image is an evaporated one, made visible 
; by the bof61 inside fill.  The imag(p3) parameter of one-googol 
; is the give-away sign.  The original image still exists some-
; where, but certainly not on the screen.
; 
; The parent fractal, before evaporation, is a fairly normal M-set 
; rotated about -30 degrees.  Today's image lies in a small spiral 
; in a larger spiral in the evaporated East Valley area of the 
; parent.  The unevaporated version of today's image is almost 
; equal to the evaporated version, and in fact might appear as its 
; own FOTD in a day or so.
; 
; As is always the case, the approximately 20-minute wait for the 
; image to render from the parameter file can be avoided by down-
; loading the finished GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Both weather and cats were near perfect here at Fractal Central 
; on Saturday.  The skies turned sunny by afternoon and the 
; temperature held at 84F 29C, making for contented cats.  A 
; secondary advantage was the money I saved when no treat of tuna 
; was needed.  Today is starting just as fine.  I assume that, 
; unless an unwelcome stray cat wanders by, Thomas and Tippy will 
; be in fine moods also.
; 
; Well, the human schedule for today includes a trip to one of the 
; apparently countless junque emporiums nearby, where we'll spend 
; several hours looking at the stuff other people discarded.  I 
; could think of better ways to spend a Sunday, but it's good 
; enough.  When we return, I'll start work on tomorrow's FOTD.  
; Until then, take care, and things are not always as they appear.
