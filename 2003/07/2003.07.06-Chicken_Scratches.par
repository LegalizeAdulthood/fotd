; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's FOTD we take a trip to the barnyard to see the 
; "Chicken Scratches" in the dirt there.  Well, what else could I 
; name such a scratchy image?  The expression behind the scratchi-
; ness combines various portions of Z, (1/Z), Z^2, and Z^2.1.  The 
; whole works is iterated by the MandelbrotMix3a formula, which 
; works like the MandelbrotMix4 formula, except that it combines 4 
; different powers of Z instead of 2, and the critical points must 
; be calculated somehow by the user and entered as real(p5).  
; I use the graphical method of calculation.
; 
; The parent fractal appears as an oversized M-set rotated 180 
; degrees, so that east is west.  This figure is quite normal 
; appearing in its overall shape, but in its filaments, craziness 
; appears.  The filaments start out from their buds in a normal 
; enough manner, but halfway to their ends, they split in two.  
; This splitting is most obvious in the period-2 filament, which 
; starts out pointing directly east along the positive X-axis, but 
; before it reaches the large midget, splits in two.  Today's 
; image is located near the point where the splitting takes place.
; 
; The -0.25*(Z^2.1) part of today's formula is the main driving 
; force behind the image.  The main feature of the image is the 
; 'scratches' that surround the midget.  Such scratches are a 
; common feature along the 'main stem' area of Mandeloids of 
; orders such as 2.1.
; 
; When coloring the image, I added the purplish aura around the 
; midget to intentionally give the whole image a kind of coronal 
; discharge effect.  The rest of the colors were intensified in a 
; separate program.  The intensification is included in the 
; attached parameter file, which runs in 3-1/2 minutes on my tired 
; machine, faster on newer models.
; 
; Another way to see the chicken scratches is to download the 
; finished image from one of the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; though by the time the finished image has downloaded and brought 
; into the Fractint program, around 3-1/2 minutes will have passed.
; 
; Saturday was sunny and hot here at Fractal Central.  Luckily for 
; the cat duo the rain bypassed this area, giving them a lazy 
; afternoon in the yard.  The temperature of 93F 34C insured that 
; their afternoon would be lazy.
; 
; Today is starting in a similar manner.  If the rain stays away, 
; the duo will have another pleasant day.  As for me, I'm ready to 
; pass the day doing as little real work as possible.  Until next 
; fractal, take care, and see you in 24 hours.
