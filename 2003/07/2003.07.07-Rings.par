; FOTD -- July 07, 2003 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Due to heavy weather at Fractal Central last evening, today's 
; FOTD is both late and brief.
; 
; What do you get if you subtract Z^2.1 from Z^1.9?  You get a 
; Mandelbrot set that is splitting up, but does not know which way 
; to split.  In addition to being rotated 180 degrees, the figure 
; has two main stems, and East Valley, now on the west side, has 
; split into two separate valleys, with a broad area between them 
; containing a whole new world.  Today's scene is located in a 
; basin rather deep in the northern half of East Valley.
; 
; With little thought, I named today's image "Rings".  Then I 
; rated it at a 4.  The rating of 4 is honest.  There is little in 
; the image that has not been seen many times before, and I gave 
; little effort to the coloring.  The slow render time of 46 
; minutes is mostly due to the high maxiter of most of the 
; elements of the image.  But this 3/4 hour wait can be avoided by 
; downloading the finished GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Sunday was sunny and hot here at Fractal Central, with a 
; temperature of 93F 34C, giving the dynamic cats a lazy afternoon 
; in the yard.  But at sunset a severe thunder-storm moved in, 
; cutting both power and phone service.  The power was back on 
; within three hours, but the phone was out until 3pm today.
; 
; I've still got a bit of work to get caught up on, so until next 
; FOTD, take care, and enjoy fractals.
