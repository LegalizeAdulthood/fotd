; FOTD -- July 08, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The fractal phone, which had just been repaired, went out again 
; Monday afternoon.  When I last checked, it was still not 
; working.  As a result, I had to use an alternate connection and 
; today's FOTD is once again late.
; 
; The parent fractal is an impossible-to-describe, oversized nest 
; of bays and pieces with X-axis symmetry, produced when 9 parts 
; of Z^(-2.1) are subtracted from 9 parts of Z^(-1.9).  A long, 
; looping, zig-zagging filament extends east of the main action.  
; Today's scene is located very close to the point where this 
; filament crosses the X-axis.
; 
; When rendered in the traditional manner, with the outside 
; colored according to the iteration count, today's image is . . . 
; well, all right.  When rendered with the outside colored by the 
; 'tdis' option, today's image reaches FOTD status, and rates a 6, 
; which equals a bit above average.
; 
; When studying the image in search of a name, I was still annoyed 
; by the out-of-service telephone.  In my state of mind, I saw in 
; the image the cells of a cellular phone system, which do not 
; always switch as smoothly as they were originally supposed to 
; do.  I named the image "Cellular Fractal".
; 
; Luckily, the attached parameter file runs smoother than a 
; cellular phone switches cells, and it runs in 3-1/2 minutes.  
; With a good cellular connection, or a working wire connection, 
; the finished GIF file can be downloaded in even less time from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The hot sun and temperature of 91F 28C here at Fractal Central 
; on Monday was good enough to give the dynamic fractal cats a 
; generous outing in the yard and an exciting adventure in the 
; surrounding brush.  For a brief period, a storm threatened, but 
; passed by harmlessly to the south, permitting the duo to finish 
; their afternoon of fun.  Today looks like a repeat.  Could the 
; duo possibly have three good days in a row?
; 
; My day will be better if they can get the fractal phone fixed 
; sometime today and keep it fixed this time.  Until then, I have 
; the use of another phone and ample other work to distract me 
; from the bumbling attempts at phone repair.  Regardless, I'll 
; return in 24 or so hours with another FOTD.  Until then, take 
; care, and maybe this second outage is not the phone company's 
; fault.
