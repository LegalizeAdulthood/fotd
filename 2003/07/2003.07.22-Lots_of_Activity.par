; FOTD -- July 22, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; A day that starts with only 37 spam e-mails and a nearly empty 
; work-shelf can't be all bad.  Unfortunately, the 37 spams are a 
; fluke, and fortunately, the nearly empty work shelf is a fluke 
; also.  I could eliminate the spam, at least for a while, by 
; changing my e-mail address, but all those 'hi ya!', 'remember 
; me!' and 'mdqwk zutpdxloj' subject lines have become almost like 
; old friends waiting to greet me and then be deleted when I open 
; my e-mail box every morning.
; 
; Today's bustling image is also filled with activity.  In fact, 
; it is so active that it appears almost hectic.  Because of its 
; activity, I have given it the not very poetic name "Lots of 
; Activity".
; 
; The parent fractal was created by subtracting 0.8 parts of 
; Z^(-1.2) from one part of Z^(1.1) before adding (1/C).  It is a 
; twisted Mandeloid consisting of a single large main bay edged 
; with unusually small buds, which are so similar in size that the 
; main period-2 bud is nearly impossible to find without checking. 
; Avoiding the impossible, I checked.
; 
; Today's scene is located very near the tip of the filament 
; extending from the 'main' bud.  The hectic effect has been 
; achieved by rendering the scene with the 'outside' coloring 
; option set to 'atan'.  The normal 'iter' outside setting also 
; creates an interesting scene, as do several other options, but 
; the 'atan' option gives the best results, at least with today's 
; image.
; 
; I have had a run of below-average images lately, so maybe I have 
; over-rated today's.  But when I saw the result of the 'atan' 
; option, I was so surprised that I gave the image a rating of a 
; much-above-average 8.
; 
; The recent render times seem to be in inverse co-relation to the 
; quality of the finished images.  Today's image, which renders in 
; only 5 minutes, continues that trend.  And if rendering fractals 
; is not your 'cup of tea', the completed GIF image may be down-
; loaded from the FOTD web sites, which are located at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather was better than had been expected here at 
; Fractal central on Monday.  True, it was oppressively muggy and 
; the temperature reached 91F 33C, but the forecasted rain failed 
; to arrive, permitting the fractal cats an extended romp in the 
; grass.  By the time their fun ended, the duo were so tired that 
; they settled to sleep without their customary evening treats.
; 
; Rain is once again forecast for today, and once again I see 
; great patches of blue sky overhead.  A forecast of rain and 
; actual rain are two entirely unrelated things, so I'll believe 
; the forecast of rain when I see actual water falling from the 
; sky.  If my cynicism is correct, and it usually is, the cats 
; will have another fun day.  And with another slow work day 
; coming, today is sure to be a fun day for me.  Until next FOTD, 
; take care and be alert for the rain.
