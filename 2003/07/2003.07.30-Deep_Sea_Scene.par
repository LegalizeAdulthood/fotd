; FOTD -- July 30, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today might be the first time I have ever used the 
; 'epsiloncross' inside fill in a FOTD fractal.  This fill colors 
; the points according to how close they come to the X and Y axes 
; in their orbits.  For some reason, this inside fill spreads into 
; the outside areas as the proximity is raised.  It has done this 
; in today's image, where it has produced the fish-bone effect 
; that inspired the name.
; 
; The parent fractal was produced by taking plain Z and adding 
; 1/20 part of Z^10 to it, then adding C.  This parent resembles a 
; M-set rotated 200 degrees, with a convergence of 9 valleys where 
; its single East Valley should be.  Today's scene is located in 
; the fourth valley counting clockwise.
; 
; While studying the image in search of a name, I at first could 
; think of nothing.  Then something in the picture reminded me of 
; an underwater scene, and the 'epsiloncross' features started to 
; look like fish skeletons.  I named the image "Deep-Sea Scene" 
; though it more closely resembles things that might be seen in 
; shallow water.
; 
; The rating of 7 is perhaps a bit high, but this is one of the 
; few times, if not the only time I have used the 'epsiloncross' 
; inside fill in a FOTD image, and that fact alone makes the image 
; unique, or at least nearly so.
; 
; The render time of 3 minutes is un-irritatingly short -- a real 
; bargain for the time spent.  Downloading the completed GIF image 
; from one of the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; is equally efficient, assuming that the internet is not having 
; one of its occasional bad days.
; 
; Tuesday featured perfect weather and perfect cats here at 
; Fractal Central.  The blue skies were decorated with only a few 
; angel-hair cirrus and cottonpuff cumulus clouds.  The winds were 
; light from the north, and the temperature reached only 81F 27C, 
; at a time of year when near 90F 32C is normal.  The cats spent 
; several hours in the yard, meditating on whatever topic cats 
; meditate on.
; 
; Today's weather should be perfect once again.  I expect the cats 
; will be perfect also.  Expect no surprises (other than the 
; fractal) when the next FOTD appears in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and seek tranquility.
