; FOTD -- November 19, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; (Please direct any non-fractal comments to the philofractal 
; list.)
; 
; Too many years ago, when I was a curious young boy, (age 13 or 
; so), I found my share of unbelievable claims in columns and 
; books such as Ripley's 'Believe it or Not'.  I remember one 
; claim in particular -- that the botfly can fly 808 miles per 
; hour, which is faster than sound.  I wondered where the tiny fly 
; found the energy.  As it turned out, that particular claim was 
; false, but many of the things that appeared in the column, such 
; as the 'Pyramid of Hanoi', are true.
; 
; At that time, as today, the newsstand shelves were filled with 
; publications dealing with things such as lucky charms and 
; Astrology.  Being a reasonably intelligent young fellow, I felt 
; proud that I was too smart to believe in such nonsense.  Of 
; course, when I grew older I found that things such as lucky 
; charms and Astrology are only a mild form of nonsense compared 
; to the super-nonsense (we call it non-intuitive stuff) seriously 
; considered nowadays by physicists and to a lesser degree by 
; cognitive scientists.
; 
; The acceptance of the nonsensical is where science is inexorably 
; leading us.  If it is seen as superstitious to believe in the 
; real but invisible worlds and the invisible spirit beings of 
; occultism, why should it not be seen as even more superstitious 
; to believe in the infinity of real but invisible parallel 
; universes and the infinity of alternate versions of ourselves 
; which are being seriously considered by physicists?  And, is it 
; truly so absurd to wonder if the scientific and occult views of 
; other worlds are merely two different aspects of the same thing?
; 
; The modern-day realization that the world is non-sensical is 
; amazing, but the most amazing thing that has come about in the 
; past quarter century is IMO the development of computers and the 
; means to rapidly calculate fractals, which led to the discovery 
; of their infinite richness.  This is something which neither 
; occultist nor scientist could have imagined back at the time I 
; was reading 'Believe it or Not'.
; 
; The best known and most basic of all fractals is the Mandelbrot 
; set.  And the best known area of the Mandelbrot set is perhaps 
; Seahorse Valley.  Today's FOTD takes us to the bud side of the 
; north branch of the valley to view a midget that lies there.
; 
; With its many seahorse-like twists and whorls, the image fairly 
; reeks of 'Seahorse Valley', though it is still a rather pleasant 
; scene to see.  Because the area has been explored to the point 
; where it is becoming boring, I could rate the image no higher 
; than a 6, but what could one expect from an image that renders 
; in 35 seconds?
; 
; The alternate way of seeing the image is to download it from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; A raw, cloudy, damp, chilly day here at Fractal Central on 
; Thursday kept the cats confined to the porch.  The temperature 
; of 50F 10C and occasional drizzle made their confinement a short 
; one.  After 20 minutes they were back indoors, asking for tuna.  
; Today is starting milder but still cloudy.  And rain is due.  I 
; expect sulky cats before the day ends.
; 
; But before the sulking begins, I must finish the work.  Until 
; next time, take care, and watch out for that invisible dark 
; matter and energy.
