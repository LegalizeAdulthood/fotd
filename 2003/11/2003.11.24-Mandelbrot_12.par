; FOTD -- November 24, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The discussion will be short because of an unexpected job that 
; came in about an hour ago.  It's not a large job, but if I let 
; it sit on the shelf, we could be getting ourselves into another 
; backlog.
; 
; Today's image from the Mandelbrot set is a study in finding 
; order in chaos.  The scene is located on the north shoreline 
; of the first bud beyond the large bud at -1 on the X-axis, in 
; the fifth valley of the valley series of a sub-bud.  Almost 
; total chaos prevails in this area, with only a few remnants of 
; anything resembling order.  The midget in today's image is 
; surrounded by one of these quasi-orderly areas.
; 
; The rating of a 7 might be a bit liberal, but I kind of like 
; the image, and this is almost certainly the first time this 
; particular midget has been seen by human eyes.
; 
; The scene is one of very high iteration, with even a maxiter of 
; 300,000 not quite resolving the midget.  At 36,600, the logmap 
; is also set unusually high.  The result is a render time of 44 
; minutes, which can be eliminated by downloading the completed 
; GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The Sunday weather was rather bland here at Fractal Central.  
; The temperature in the 50's (around 13C), the hazy skies, and 
; the light winds, were notably forgettable.  The cats were happy 
; in the yard however, and this was very memorable.  As the day 
; ended, the satisfied cats had their heads in their tuna dishes.
; 
; And now it's time for me to tackle that building pile of work.  
; When I finish, I'll tackle the Mandelbrot set.  Until next time, 
; take care, and try to avoid those inevitable dead ends.
