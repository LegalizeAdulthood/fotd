; FOTD -- November 05, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image is a whimsical thing created 
; by adding a lot of just plain Z to a little bit of Z^11.  The 
; resulting fractal appears as a tiny Mandeloid surrounded by a 
; galaxy of even tinier satellite Mandeloids.  Today's midget is 
; located in one of these satellites in the southeast suburbs of 
; its parent.
; 
; The midget is quite 'disconnected', or cut off from the main 
; body of its parent, which makes the traditional 'equal-iteration-
; band' rendering rather dull, and at the same time makes the 
; other 'outside' options worth a look.  The 'outside' option that 
; works the best with today's scene is the 'fmod', with the proxim-
; ity set to a rather high 1.9.  This rendering creates a scene of 
; terraces, which for some reason I have named "Total Sorcery".  
; The rating of a 6 might be a bit liberal.
; 
; Real sorcery, like real magic, is all in the mind, a fact that 
; all true sorcerers admit.  But that doesn't make it any less 
; real.  Sorcery, which need not be used only for evil purposes, 
; involves a different kind of reality, and it is up to its practi-
; tioners to shift their awareness to the reality where sorcery is 
; a true fact of nature.  (Is not the mind a part of nature?)
; 
; Fractals are also a true fact of nature, and like sorcery, they 
; exist in a different kind of reality -- the reality of the world 
; of numbers.  Luckily, this world of numbers has been made visi-
; ble through the modern computer.  One of these days, someone 
; just might devise a way for computers to make visible the world 
; in the mind where sorcery exists.  And then . . . who knows . . .
; magic might become as real as fractals.
; 
; It is almost magical that today's image renders in a mere 53 
; seconds.  That is even faster than the time required to download 
; the already-rendered image from one of the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather was perfect all day Tuesday here at Fractal Central. 
; The light winds, sunny skies, and high temperature of 80F 26.5C 
; that prevailed are most unusual in early November.  The fractal 
; cats took full advantage of the perfection by romping in the 
; yard and sleeping on the porch.  Tippy even made a leap at a 
; bird that landed on the railing, but the bird was far too quick, 
; and Tippy went without his tidbit.  A bit of tuna eased his 
; disappointment.
; 
; Today is starting much less perfect.  The heavy clouds, fog, and 
; drizzle that moved in overnight are firmly ensconced.  The rain 
; that is due later this afternoon will make things only worse.  
; The cats will likely have a bad day.  But, if the moderate 
; amount of work now before me goes smoothly, I will finish by 
; 2pm, and my day will be acceptable, especially if I have a good 
; evening in Fractal Land.  Check back tomorrow to see how things 
; go.  Until then, take care, and where is nowhere?
