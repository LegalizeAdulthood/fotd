; FOTD -- November 16, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There was no FOTD on Saturday, the 15th of November.  This was 
; because I found a small pile of unfinished graphic work, and 
; wanted to get it out of the way before the week ended.  As I 
; learned recently when I fell a week behind in the work, small 
; tasks left unfinished soon pile up, and merge into a large task 
; that takes several weeks to clear away.  Rather than start 
; falling behind again, I decided to forego the daily FOTD and 
; clear away the work.  Now I can search for fractals without the 
; feeling of guilt.  I may occasionally miss other FOTD's in the 
; future.  If so, do not feel concern.  I am not growing tired of 
; doing the FOTD; I am merely tending to first things first.
; 
; With today's fractal comes good news and bad news.  The good 
; news is that the image takes only 15 seconds to render.  The bad 
; news is that the image rates only an average 5.  In search of 
; the image, I went to a midget on a filament extending from a 
; sub-bud on the northwest shore of the large period-3 north bud 
; of the Mandelbrot set.  I zoomed in on a point of the filament 
; just beyond the end of the main stem of the midget.  To no one's 
; surprise, I found a midget there.
; 
; Since the location of the second midget is just beyond the tip 
; of the stem of a larger midget, the second midget, which appears 
; in today's image, is surrounded by not-quite-connected sword-
; like elements quite accurately mirroring the overall location of 
; the scene.  (Four much larger 'swords' appear out beyond the 
; borders of the screen, and can be seen by outzooming and turning 
; off the logmap.)  If I were giving the image a proper title 
; rather than a catalog number, the name would be something such 
; as "Sword Play".
; 
; The pre-rendered GIF image is available on Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and on Scott's site at:
; 
; But even a high-speed download cannot be faster than rendering 
; today's image from the parameter file.

; 
; The winds remained brisk Friday here at Fractal Central, but 
; slacked enough in the afternoon for the fractal cats to venture 
; into the yard.  Tippy even managed to climb a few feet into a 
; tree and sit there on the lowest branch, enjoying the sun and 
; temperature of 46F 8C, and remembering the days when he could 
; dash 20 feet up the trunk in a single bound.  Thomas watched the 
; action with disinterest.
; 
; Saturday was sunny and warmer, with almost no wind, and a temper-
; ature of 55F 13C that made outdoor conditions quite pleasant for 
; the duo.  They spent several hours in the holly thicket, and 
; needed to be coaxed indoors when the day ended.  Today looks to 
; be a not-so-sunny repeat.
; 
; I'll try to take it reasonably easy today.  If I try hard enough, 
; I might even succeed.  Until next FOTD and next trip into the 
; infinite depths of the Mandelbrot set, take care, and where oh 
; where did it all come from?
