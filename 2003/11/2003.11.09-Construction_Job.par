; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have won no further lotteries since yesterday.  I'm not sure 
; whether this is bad news or good news, but it is most curious 
; that, despite having won close to a dozen lotteries over the 
; past month, I am no wealthier now that I was before my good luck 
; arrived.   ;-)
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image can be best described as 
; 'mostly blobs with scattered Mandeloids'.  And amid the Mandel-
; oids lurk some holes that are decidedly not Mandeloid-shaped, 
; yet have buds along their borders that indicate the presence of 
; a critical area.  Today's scene is located on a filament exten-
; ding from one of these buds, near the point where the filament 
; passes a hole shaped like a figure eight.
; 
; I named the image "Construction Job" in honor, or dis-honor, of 
; the construction that is taking place two blocks from Fractal 
; Central, down at the bottom of the hill, where a new storm drain 
; is being installed, which hopefully will eliminate the flooding 
; that seems to happen down there on a regular schedule.  I also 
; chose the name because, by the coloring, I rather constructed 
; something from nothing.  I guess this makes today's image 
; another piece of fractal-art.
; 
; After studying the image for a few minutes, I decided it is just 
; a little above average, which equals a 6 on my arbitrary 0-to-10 
; scale of fractal worth.  The image does have a kind of glowing 
; effect to it, but the colors, especially around the perimeter, 
; are not all that pleasant to look at.
; 
; The 'passes=g' option is extremely efficient with today's image. 
; The render time when passes=1 is 17 minutes; 'passes=g' does the 
; job in only 7 minutes.  Since the result in either case is 
; exactly the same, I have removed the 'passes=1' entry from the 
; parameter file and cut the render time by 60 percent.  
; 
; But if 7 minutes is still too slow to fit into a busy schedule, 
; the completed GIF image may be downloaded from one of the FOTD 
; web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Though it was chilly here at Fractal Central on Saturday, with a 
; temperature of only 46F 8C, the sun was warm, and the cats 
; enjoyed a couple hours in the yard.  This was enough to prevent 
; the sulking that happens when they get too little time outside.  
; When evening came, the duo settled down quite peacefully, and 
; passed the rest of the day as decorations.
; 
; But this morning's temperature is only 26F -3C, cold enough to 
; put a film of ice on the water dish on the porch.  I wonder how 
; the duo will take this sudden cold weather.  I'll know the 
; answer in a few hours.  For the rest of the day, I'll be trying 
; to take it easy, but the fractal lady has that 'lets go look at 
; antiques' gleam in her eye.  So we'll have to see how the day 
; goes.  Regardless, in 24 hours I'll return with another fractal. 
; Until then, take care, and keep those spirits up.
