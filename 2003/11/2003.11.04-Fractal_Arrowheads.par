; FOTD -- November 04, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image reminds me of the indian (Native American in PC 
; language) artifacts that are sometimes found in the Fractal 
; Central area.  Lots of these are still lying around the area, 
; waiting to be discovered.  But it is not a matter of going out 
; and picking up a relic.  The difficulty lies in distinguishing 
; the artifacts from the natural stones.  It takes an expert to 
; pick out an old arrowhead among the pebbles littering a river 
; bank.
; 
; There is no such difficulty in today's image.  The reddish-
; orange bits that fill the image and seem to be swirling around 
; the small midget in the center could easily be old arrowheads 
; that have been lying in the ground for hundreds if not thousands 
; of years.  They could be, but they are actually fractals.  I 
; named the image "Fractal Arrowheads accordingly.
; 
; The formula Z=(-1*(Z^1.1))+(11*(Z^(-1.11)))+1/C was iterated to 
; create the parent fractal, which consists of two Mandeloids -- a 
; rather intact one on the left, and a rudimentary one on the 
; left, which is partly cut off.  Today's scene lies in what 
; remains of the East Valley of the left Mandeloid.
; 
; Today's scene is unusual in that almost all the outside options 
; work well with it.  I chose the 'summ' option because that one 
; impressed me the most when I saw at thumbnail size how it worked.
; 
; The rating of today's image lies somewhere between 7 and 8.  
; Feeling conservative, I rated it at a 7, though an 8 would have 
; been nearly as accurate.  The render time of 11 minutes borders 
; on the excessive.  The better way to see the orange arrowheads 
; in today's image is to download it from one of the FOTD web 
; sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Monday started perfect and stayed perfect all day here at 
; Fractal Central.  Cloudless skies, balmy south winds and a 
; temperature of 81F 27C kept the dynamic fractal cats coming and 
; going from 11am until sunset, which comes at 5pm in this part of 
; the world at this time of year.  It might be winter in 
; Minnesota, but it's summer in Maryland.
; 
; Today looks to be another perfect one.  The cats are waiting 
; with anxious anticipation.  As for me, I've got a couple hours 
; of work to wrap up before I return to Fractal Land.  The next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and could 
; a fractal ever be complex enough to be considered alive?
