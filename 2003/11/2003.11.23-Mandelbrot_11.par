; FOTD -- November 23, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's trip into the Mandelbrot set takes us into a previously 
; unexplored (at least by me) valley on the north shore of the 
; main bay.  The exact valley in question is the east branch of 
; the sixth valley of the series of valleys along the center line 
; of the large north bud.  In this valley, which is far too remote 
; to have been given a name, broad areas of quasi-order are 
; sprinkled with scepter-shaped areas of near-total chaos.
; 
; The midget in the image is located in one of these scepter-like 
; areas of chaos.  The nature of the area is reflected in the 
; nearly-straight arms radiating from the midget.  I have tried to 
; raise the impact of the scene by giving it a rather intense 
; color palette, though even the colors cannot raise the rating 
; beyond that of an everyday 6.
; 
; But it's still a striking scene, and the render time of five 
; minutes is reasonably fast.  Best of all, the completed image is 
; available for download in GIF format on Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or on Scott's site at:

; 
; Saturday was a near perfect day here at Fractal Central, as 
; expected.  The dynamic fractal cats were near angels, as 
; expected.  They spent most of the day lounging in the grass, 
; wishing more warm sun could get through the evergreen holly 
; trees at the bottom of the yard.  Luckily, the temperature of 
; 66F 19C was mild enough to keep them comfortable.  As I watched 
; them just lying there, I remembered the days not too many years 
; ago, when they would have spent the day dashing about like 
; kittens.  Today is due to be a repeat, though now, at 9:00am, 
; a light fog is drifting in, and the grass is still too wet with 
; dew for their sensitive paws.
; 
; My plans for the day are still uncertain.  The work is caught 
; up, but there is always the chance that I'll be drafted into a 
; trip to one of the countless local antique malls.  Regardless, 
; the next trip into the Mandelbrot set will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and will the truth prevail?
