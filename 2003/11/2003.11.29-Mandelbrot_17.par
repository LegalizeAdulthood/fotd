; FOTD -- November 29, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's 8:30am and all is well here at Fractal Central.  My 18-day 
; tour of the Mandelbrot set is coming to a close.  Starting 
; December 1st we will move on to other formulas (MandelbrotMix4 
; perhaps) and other fractals.  Was the tour of the M-set a 
; success?  Its purpose was to find new things in the well-
; explored areas of the Set.  Did we find anything new?  We 
; certainly found some midgets that have never before been seen, 
; but could these midgets actually be considered new?  Like so 
; many other things in the land of fractals, and in the world 
; itself, it is up to the individual fractalist to decide.
; 
; My own opinion is that I fell a little short of my original 
; intent.  I found nothing in the M-set that is truly new and has 
; never been seen, but then I have an artistic temperament, and 
; artists are never satisfied with the things they create.  So I 
; guess we'll call it a stand-off and look forward to better 
; things to come during December.
; 
; Today's image takes us to the star of the period-8 bud on the 
; northeast shore of the main bay of the Mandelbrot set.  Zooming 
; in toward the center of the star, we suddenly stop and turn onto 
; a side branch.  We find a small spiral and stop to search for a 
; midget.  Since midgets are everywhere in the Set, our search 
; soon uncovers a rather interesting little fellow -- the one that 
; now appears at the center of today's image.
; 
; It's not a bad image.  In fact, it rates an above-average 7.  
; True, this type of fractal has often been seen before, but I am 
; rather pleased with the coloring, and because of that, decided 
; to rate the image a 7 rather than a 6.  Perhaps its best feature 
; is its speed.  With a render time on my machine of 11 seconds, 
; it is the fastest FOTD image in many months.  But despite the 
; speed, the task of saving and renaming this letter is about 
; equal to the task of downloading the completed GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The rain continued most all day Friday here at Fractal Central, 
; and the temperature topped out at 59F 15C.  The fractal cats, 
; disliking wet ears and paws, decided to remain indoors and sulk, 
; hoping the sulk would bring a treat of tuna.  They were right.  
; The tuna appeared.
; 
; My day was reasonably pleasant.  There was lots of left-over 
; turkey, and as today's image shows, my luck in fractal-land was 
; reasonably good.  Now if we can only have three or four good 
; days in a row . . .  
; 
; Until next FOTD, take care, and become one with your fractals.
