; FOTD -- November 20, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's scene, we again take a trip into the depths of the 
; Mandelbrot set.  We choose the basin of the midget at -1.47 on 
; the X-axis to be the scene of our trip.  This midget is 
; surrounded by radiating filaments, with the location of today's 
; scene found on a small filament on the northeast shore.
; 
; The midget in the image is of the fourth order, meaning it is 
; located near a midget, near a midget, near a midget, near the 
; midget at -1.47.  For some reason known only to the mathematical 
; illuminati, when a midget is located in one or more basins of 
; attraction of larger midgets, the number of elements surrounding 
; the midget resets itself several times as the midget is neared.  
; Thus, instead of having the series 4,8,16,32...infinity, we have 
; 4,8,16,32,...infinity, 8,16,32,64...infinity, 16,32,64,128...
; infinity, and so on.
; 
; Today's midget shows this quirk quite clearly.  And other than 
; having this curiosity, it is a fairly lively scene, maybe not 
; quite worth the half-hour required to render it from the para-
; meter file, but certainly worth the effort to go online and 
; download the completed GIF image from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Rating the image was no problem.  Considering the image itself 
; and the time required to render it, I could rate it no higher 
; than a 6.  Pictures of scenes such as this are fairly common.  
; (Had I found today's image 10 years ago, it might have rated 
; an 8.)
; 
; The weather in the Fractal Central area on Wednesday was violent 
; to say the least.  Torrential rain in the afternoon caused the 
; local streams to flood, resulting in three deaths and several 
; rescues.  The temperature reached 68F 20C, but with flash flood 
; conditions prevailing, the fractal duo wisely chose to remain 
; indoors, asking for tuna.  Today is starting sunny, but the wind 
; is blowing, and the duo does not like wind, which hides the 
; subtle sounds of approaching danger.  They may be reluctant to 
; venture out of doors.  The fractal basement escaped with only a 
; small puddle in the corner.
; 
; My graphic work is reasonably under control.  Another Mandelbrot 
; fractal in 24 hours is a virtual certainty.  Until then, take 
; care, and keep your fractals dry.  (Come to think of it, I have 
; never seen a wet fractal.)
