; FOTD -- November 22, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; After surprising myself with the things I found yesterday in the 
; deep chaos on the northwest shore of the main bay, I decided to 
; continue my exploration today in another chaotic area.
; 
; Today's image continues the same theme as yesterday's, though 
; this time we examine the northeast shore of the main period-2 
; bud of the Mandelbrot set rather than the northwest shore of the 
; main bay.  The overall appearance of today's image is similar to 
; yesterday's, the increased coverage of orderly areas being the 
; main difference.
; 
; If today's image rather than yesterday's had appeared first, I 
; might have given it a rating of an 8.  Since it is a repeat 
; however, I can rate it at only a 7.  But with its gold chaos 
; filled with hints of Siegel disks and the blue aura around the 
; chaos, it is still a worthy image, well worth the 14 minutes 
; required to render it from the parameter file.
; 
; The time to download the finished image is far less.  That down-
; load may be found at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; With its sun and temperature of 72F 22C, Friday turned out even 
; more perfect than Thursday here at F.C., giving the dynamic cats 
; their best day outdoors of the entire autumn.  When dusk came, 
; they were still reluctant to come indoors, and needed to be 
; coaxed with a dish of tuna.  Today looks like a repeat, both 
; with the weather and the cats' moods.
; 
; I have a small bit of work to finish before I can devote my 
; energies to the difficult task of doing nothing.  Until next 
; time, take care, and will we ever know the single ultimate truth?
