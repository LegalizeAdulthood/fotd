; FOTD -- November 21, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the region of the Mandelbrot set that 
; produces Siegel disks when sliced in the Julia direction.  It is 
; not exactly Siegel disk territory however.  True Siegel disks 
; are found in the Julia sets of the total chaos on the exact edge 
; of the main bay, and are of infinite iterations, which makes 
; them impossible to calculate even though they do exist.
; 
; Today's image contains things that are almost Siegel disks 
; however.  The things that resemble stuffed olives are about as 
; close as one can come to Siegel disks in the M-set.  By striking 
; the space bar twice with today's image on the screen, one may 
; draw a Julia fractal that is virtually a 'Siegel disk' fractal, 
; but that's another story.  (Still another story is the appear-
; ance of this part of the Julibrot when sliced in the odd direc-
; tions.)
; 
; Yet another story is the things known as 'Herman's rings', which 
; I remember being discussed on one of the fractal lists a number 
; of years ago.  Unfortunately, I have no idea what 'Herman's 
; rings' are.
; 
; Today's image is actually a rather new appearing fractal in the 
; M-set, and deserves its rating of an 8, especially since the 
; parameter file renders in a speedy 3 minutes plus 1/100 of one 
; second, at least on my tired old machine with the exhaust fan 
; that must be started by hand.
; 
; The location of today's image is in the tip of a curving area of 
; chaos in a valley of a tiny bud on the northwest shoreline of 
; the main bay.  Much of its impact is due to the coloring, on 
; which I spent some extra time.  This would appear to make it 
; somewhat a work of art, though I claim no credit for the things 
; actually done by the numbers.
; 
; The three-minute render time may be escaped by downloading the 
; image from Paul's web site, which hopefully is up and running at:
; 
;         <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and from Scott's site at:
; 
;         <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Thursday here at Fractal Central dawned brilliant and stayed 
; brilliant all day.  The afternoon temperature of 59F 15C was 
; perfect for cats and man alike, with a wind that stayed within 
; reason.  While the cats enjoyed these great conditions in the 
; yard, the man finished the nominal amount of work that had 
; accumulated since the preceding day ended.  The day came to a 
; close with everyone happy, which is quite an unusual event.
; 
; Today and tomorrow promise to be repeats, so it looks like happi-
; ness will be the rule.  Until next FOTD, take care, and the old 
; M-set is not exhausted yet.
