; FOTD -- November 14, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I realize that today's FOTD is late.  During the wind-storm on 
; Thursday we had another of our traditional power failures, 
; which, though brief, was just long enough to put me behind in 
; the graphics work.  Wanting to avoid another work back-up 
; situation, I spent the first part of today catching up on the 
; work that should have been finished yesterday.  Fortunately, 
; when the work was caught up, I had good luck in my fractal 
; quest.
; 
; That quest took me out the negative stem of the Mandelbrot set 
; to the East Valley of the large midget at -1.75, where I found a 
; world quite similar to the East Valley area of the M-set 
; itself, yet strangely different.  The scene I found there 
; reminds me of a display of caladium leaves, and I could easily 
; have named it "Caladium", but I decided to stick with the bland 
; but orderly consecutive 'Mbrot**' numbering system.
; 
; The rating of 6 might be a bit conservative, but it's hard to 
; give a fractal that has been found almost automatically a rating 
; higher than 'a little above average'.  The render time of 4-1/2 
; minutes is fast enough to make running the parameter file 
; practical, and slow enough to make downloading the completed GIF 
; image from:
; 
;         <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;         <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; more convenient.
; 
; Tuesday was partly cloudy with a temperature of 46F 8C, but the 
; wind gusted over 60mph (near 100kph) during most of the after-
; noon.  The constant roar kept the intrepid duo very skittish, 
; removing all thoughts of going outside from their heads.  They 
; passed the day on their shelves by the windows, watching the 
; packs of empty trash cans clattering down the street.
; 
; Today has been a bit on the busy side, but it is nothing that I 
; cannot finish by later this evening.  And then it's back to the 
; Mandelbrot set to find tomorrow's FOTD.  Until tomorrow, take 
; care, and there will always be fractals.
