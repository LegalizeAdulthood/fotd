; FOTD -- November 02, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I got quite a shock this morning when I opened my e-mail box.  
; Among the hundred or so letters destined for immediate deletion 
; I found one with the subject 'jamth, I met your mom last night 
; xvztgsh hltbrs'.  I was both shocked and elated.  My mother has 
; been dead over 10 years, which meant that spirit communication 
; with the dead through the internet must have at last been 
; achieved.  But my wonderment did not last long.  When I opened 
; the letter, off-line of course, my web browser came up, and a 
; message appeared telling me that the server could not be found.  
; My disappointment was beyond words.  The whole letter was just a 
; ruse to lure me to a web site where someone wanted to sell me 
; something I neither needed nor wanted.  I drowned my sorrow in a 
; glass of orange juice.   ;-)
; 
; Today's image however is no disappointment.  It is a scene in 
; the fractal that results when 0.2 parts of Z^2.97 are subtracted 
; from Z^2.03 before C is added.  In this fractal, the infinite 
; splitting that normally occurs on the negative stem of a fractal 
; such as Z^2.01+C occurs on a spurious stem that has magically 
; appeared in the 'East Valley' area.
; 
; This area of today's parent fractal is interesting enough when 
; rendered with the normal equal-iteration-band method, but it is 
; really outstanding when rendered as it has been in today's 
; image, with the 'fmod' outside option with the proximity value 
; set to 0.4.
; 
; I named the image "Rainbow Vision" because of its rainbow-like 
; palette of colors.  The rating of 8 is justified, as will become 
; obvious 2-1/2 minutes after the parameter file is started.  And 
; one of those 2-1/2 minutes can be knocked off the waiting time 
; by going directly to Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or to Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and downloading the completed image from there.
; 
; Near perfect weather on Saturday made for near ideal cats.  The 
; sunny skies and temperature of 81F 27C were perfect for cats 
; and man alike.  Both enjoyed an afternoon of doing little in the 
; yard.  When evening came, (and it comes early at this time of 
; year), the duo were ready to eat, and the man was ready to 
; venture into Fractal Land.  The day ended peacefully with a 
; junky old sci-fi 'creature' movie on the TV.
; 
; Today is starting just as pleasantly.  If all goes well, the day 
; will be as pleasant as yesterday.  If not -- well, that's a 
; different story.  But regardless, 24 hours from now, another 
; fractal will appear from nowhere.  Until the next apparition, 
; take care, and be kind to your fractals, for you might come face 
; to face with one in the next world.
