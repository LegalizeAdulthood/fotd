; FOTD -- November 27, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a scene on the shore of the southern lobe of 
; the main bay, rather deep in East Valley, in a chaotic area 
; where the elements become pinched off.  The pinched-off elements 
; are obvious, but the area is actually quite a bit more chaotic 
; than the image would suggest.  Most of the detail beyond the 
; foreground elements is due to the coloring, and will rapidly 
; disappear if the colors are changed.
; 
; In the picture, I have departed from my usual inside=solid-black 
; routine, and given the inside of the midget an electric blue 
; coloring, which suggests, at least to me, a window into an 
; alternate reality beyond the one visible to the senses.  To 
; increase the impact of the brilliant interior, I have faded the 
; colors to near black as they approach the midget.
; 
; Despite the rather ordinary effect of the image, I have given it 
; a rating of a 7, which equals above average.  I put more effort 
; into the coloring than meets the eye and decided to reward 
; myself with a rating one point higher than what I would ordina-
; rily give.
; 
; Due to its high iteration count, the image is a slow one, 
; requiring over 1/2 hour to complete on my machine.  But the time 
; can be saved by downloading the completed GIF image from one of 
; the FOTD web sites, which can be found at:
; 
;         <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;         <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The topic of identical Mandelbrot midgets has been raised on the 
; list recently, and has been pretty well answered.  I sometimes 
; wonder about the philosophical aspects of this topic however.  
; Except for their mirror image on the opposite side of the real 
; axis, no two midgets are exactly identical.  But with many 
; midgets the difference is infinitesimal, and cannot be discerned 
; by any means available to us.  Can such midgets then be consi-
; dered identical?  I guess it all depends on the meaning of the 
; word 'identical'.
; 
; In the Mandelbrot set, the shape of the midgets remains within 
; the range where they are recognizable.  The same is not true in 
; fractals created by more exotic formulae, where midgets can be 
; distorted totally beyond recognition.  Finding extremely dis-
; torted midgets in exotic fractals might make an interesting 
; fractal project for a future series of FOTD's.  Now on to more 
; important things.
; 
; Another average day's weather here at Fractal Central brought 
; the fractal cats an average afternoon in the yard.  The partly 
; cloudy skies, temperature of 55F 13C, and light southeast winds 
; were so average that those with no great interest in the weather 
; have little memory of the conditions.  Today is supposed to 
; bring rain, but it is starting sunny.  We'll see how things go 
; as the day progresses.
; 
; Things will likely go pretty well for me.  The work is caught up 
; and somehow I managed to avoid having to go to any Thanksgiving 
; dinners.  If my good luck holds out later today, I'll find one 
; of the infinity of great fractals that still lurk undiscovered 
; in the Mandelbrot set.  If not, I'll return in 24 hours with 
; another acceptable scene.  Until then, take care, and be aware.
