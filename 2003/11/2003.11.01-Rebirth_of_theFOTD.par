; FOTD -- November 01. 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "Rebirth of the FOTD".  Actually the name 
; is kind of a misnomer, for the FOTD has never really died.  It 
; merely slowed down a bit while I was catching up on the work 
; that had fallen behind during the previous month.  But the work 
; is now up-to-date, and the FOTD is back on track.
; 
; Today's rather baroque-looking fractal is a not-bad resumption.  
; It is an 'evaporated' scene in the fractal that results when 9 
; parts of Z^(-0.9) are combined with one part of Z^(-9) and (1/C) 
; is added rather than plain C.  The scene is then 'evaporated' by 
; raising the escape radius to one-googol, resulting in a screen 
; of nothing but 'trapped' 'inside' points.  The blank screen is 
; then re-rendered with one of the dynamic inside-fill options.  
; In today's case the 'bof61' inside fill works best.
; 
; Trying to decide on a rating for the image was no problem.  IMO, 
; it is clearly fancy enough and different enough to be considered 
; above average, which requires a rating of a 7.
; 
; With a few interruptions, the FOTD has been ongoing for 6-1/2 
; years, but in that time I have never posted a fractal honestly 
; worthy of a 10.  I have posted a few 9's, and I did once post an 
; image of the Mandelbrot set, which I rather artificially rated 
; at a 10.  The rating was justified.  After all, the M-set is 
; rather the perfect fractal, to which all others must be 
; compared.  But I have never posted another image that rated a 10.
; 
; Perhaps I never will post an image that rates a 10.  To rate an 
; honest 10, an image must honestly be 'the best of all time'.  
; Since rating fractals is such a subjective thing, and I want to 
; avoid the 'grade inflation' like that which is afflicting so 
; many of our schools, an image would need to be truly supercalli-
; fragillisticexpialidocious to move me to give it a rating of 10. 
; But the goal of a perfect 10 still remains.  And who knows?  One 
; of these days or years, I might achieve it.
; 
; Today's image may be viewed by saving this letter as a text 
; parameter file and then running it in Fractint and waiting 6 
; minutes, or by downloading the completed image from Paul's web 
; site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Friday was a near ideal Autumn day here at Fractal Central, with 
; the blue of the sky being marred by only a few unusually dense 
; cirrus clouds.  Accompanied by light winds and a temperature of 
; 70F 22C, these conditions gave the cats a comfortable afternoon 
; in the yard.  At one point, a small flock of starlings settled 
; in a nearby tree.  When Thomas saw them, he chattered at them, 
; but the birds flew away and the day ended peacefully.
; 
; Today is again starting near perfectly, with only a few scraps 
; of work lying around waiting to be done.  I should have plenty 
; time to find a fractal to knock your socks off.  But if I do, 
; I'll then need to find one to put the socks back on.  And I am 
; currently reading a newly released book titled "Consciousness -- 
; a user's guide".  It should supply action on the philofractal 
; list in the not-too-distent future.  But before then, I shall 
; return in 24 hours with fractal action.  Until tomorrow, take 
; care, and where will it all end?
