; FOTD -- November 11, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have named today's image "Triangles of Doom".  I can give no 
; logical reason for choosing such a name -- the triangular holes 
; in the image certainly appear harmless enough -- I simply felt 
; like naming the image that way.  And there certainly are enough 
; junky old sci-fi horror movies with similar names.  The most 
; likely reason for the name could be the doom the triangles would 
; bring if the fractalist who found them were to become obsessed 
; with them, and stare at them until he starved.
; 
; The rating of an above-average 7 was earned by the coloring, 
; most notably the effect of the translucent foreground features 
; being illuminated from behind.  This effect is achieved by 
; filling the holes with the maximum value of blue, and varying 
; the red and green only slightly from the maximum.  This tricks 
; the mind into thinking that it is actually viewing the sky 
; through holes in trees.
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image appears as a scattering of 
; small Mandeloids and an assortment of other, more oddly shaped 
; holes.  The most prominent Mandeloid has both a negative stem 
; that points northwest and a positive stem that points southeast. 
; The positive stem springs from East Valley and terminates in an 
; irregularly shaped hole that passes through the neck of many 
; smaller hourglass-shaped holes on the way. Today's scene is 
; found close to the point where this spurious stem terminates.
; 
; When colored in my usual inside=0 outside=iter manner, today's 
; scene is dull and flat.  But rendering the image with the 
; inside=bof61 and the outside=tdis, results in the interesting 
; terraced effect seen in today's image.  I am not an absolute 
; purist when it comes to fractals, but when I work with them, I 
; try to keep the simplicity that existed when I first discovered 
; them some 16 odd years ago, and had only the Mandelbrot set to 
; explore.  Maybe one of these months I'll devote a month to 
; scenes in the M-set, just to show that it is nowhere near being 
; exhausted.
; 
; The render time of 2-1/2 minutes is reasonably short.  And this 
; time can even be cut a bit more by downloading the completed GIF 
; image from one of the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;         <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;         <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Monday featured nothing but blue skies and sun here at Fractal 
; Central.  The temperature of 50F 10C was a bit on the chilly 
; side, but the fractal cats ignored the chill as they explored 
; the holly thicket at the bottom of the yard.  The day ended with 
; happy cats sleeping soundly (Thomas snores).  Today is starting 
; sunny and promising to be warmer.  The warmth is due to be temp-
; ered this afternoon however by clouds and perhaps a few showers. 
; We'll just have to wait and see how it goes with the dynamic 
; fractal feline duo.
; 
; As for me, I have a bit of work to accomplish before the 
; fractals can be found.  Until next FOTD, take care, and don't 
; take life too seriously.  It won't last forever.
