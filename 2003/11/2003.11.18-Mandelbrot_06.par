; FOTD -- November 18, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I just heard an item on the radio, which for some reason strikes 
; me as unbearably funny.  The enlightened city council of our 
; fair city, which recently ordered the police commissioner to 
; crack down on crime but stop harassing the criminals, has just 
; suggested an ordinance making it illegal for homeless people (in 
; non-PC language, bums) to ask for a handout unless they sing or 
; dance, or perform some other form of entertainment.  The penalty 
; would be a 50-dollar fine or a month in jail.
; 
; To help the homeless in their plight, I suggest we give every 
; homeless person a lap-top computer and a copy of Fractint, so 
; they can entertain the gathered crowd with fractals.  Nothing 
; could be more entertaining.  Besides, homeless people do not 
; have 50 dollars to pay the fine, and, with winter coming, might 
; actually appreciate a month in a warm jail.  (This situation is 
; not politics; it is comedy!)
; 
; While I'm trying to figure that one out, we have another fractal 
; to discuss.  Today's scene is located on a filament extending 
; out from the large midget at -1.75.  It is located just beyond 
; the point where the filament changes from a jagged, totally 
; chaotic line to a rather straight line with occasional zigzags.  
; At this point on the filament, there are still occasional areas 
; of chaos, but they are disconnected.  This characteristic is 
; reflected quite well in today's image, and is made even more 
; clear by half an outzoom.
; 
; Once again, I can find nothing in the image to earn it a rating 
; over a 6, which equals just a little above average.  And there 
; is no mistake in the render time -- the image actually renders 
; in 6 seconds.  But there are those who prefer their fractals 
; pre-rendered.  These fractalists can find the completed GIF 
; image ready for download on the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;         <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;         <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Monday started foggy here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats 
; watched the outside conditions carefully, but did not ask to go 
; out until the fog burned off shortly before noon.  When they did 
; go out, the sun and temperature of 61F 16C made their afternoon 
; enjoyable.  Today is starting cloudy, with rain threatening by 
; the afternoon.  The cats might not like this.
; 
; I have a bit of work to do before I can dive into the Mandelbrot 
; set in search of tomorrow's FOTD, and have a clear conscience.  
; Until that cosmic moment arrives, take care, and gosh, how the 
; old CD that came with the second edition of "Fractal Creations" 
; brings back memories!
