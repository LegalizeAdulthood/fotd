; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is a gift from Thomas, the yellow-orange fractal 
; cat.  It is a very high magnitude image of a midget lying in the 
; eastern suburbs of a larger midget.  The larger midget lies on 
; the negative stem of the M-set, just beyond the stem of the 
; large midget at -1.75.  This curious location gives the midget 
; in the image the characteristics of both the sword-like elements 
; of the negative stem and the brain-like elements of East Valley. 
; This combination of elements inspired the name "Both Ways at 
; Once".
; 
; The rating of 5 means 'average'.  The original image had a color 
; palette that earned it a 7, but before I saved the colors, I got 
; up to check on a waiting job.  While I was out of my chair, 
; Thomas decided to jump up and walk on the keyboard.  I don't 
; know which keys he pressed, but when I returned, the colors that 
; I had created had been totally lost.  After giving Thomas a 
; friendly scolding, I found another, unfortunately not as good, 
; palette.  So, thanks to Thomas, we have an image that rates only 
; an average 5 instead of the original above-average 7.
; 
; Lying at a rather extreme depth, the image requires arbitrary 
; precision math, and therefore takes 47 minutes to render.  The 
; wait can be eliminated by downloading the completed image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather deteriorated rapidly during the day 
; Wednesday here at Fractal Central, with the climax arriving at 
; 4pm when a heavy thunder-storm passed over.  There were reports 
; of a possible tornado sighted around 25 miles to the southwest, 
; but F.C. escaped untouched.  The cats managed an hour or so in 
; the yard before the rain arrived, when the temperature was 73F 
; 23C.  This appeared to satisfy their urge to be outside.
; 
; The day passed uneventfully for me.  (Which means the work went 
; smoothly.)  Hopefully, today, which is starting rainy, will pass 
; equally uneventfully.  Check back in 24 hours for another 
; stunning (IMO) fractal.  Until then, take care, and how many 
; fractals would be needed to weigh a ton?
