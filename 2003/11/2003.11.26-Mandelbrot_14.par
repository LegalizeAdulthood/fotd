; FOTD -- November 26, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Since I have another pile of work starting to develop and it's 
; the day before the 4-day Thanksgiving holiday here in the U.S., 
; today's discussion will once again be short.  I don't want 
; another backlog to get started.
; 
; The scene of today's image is deep in a filament extending 
; outward from the northeast shore of the main bay of the large 
; midget at -1.75 on the main stem of the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The magnitude is just slightly into the range where arbitrary 
; precision math is needed to maintain resolution, but despite 
; this, the image still renders in 16 minutes, which is faster 
; than some of the conventional-math images of the past few days.
; 
; For a rating, I could give the image nothing above a 6.  Hope-
; fully, before the present tour of our old friend, the Mandelbrot 
; set, comes to a close, I'll find a scene worthy of a 9 ....... 
; then again, that might be wishful thinking.
; 
; To see the scene of the action, run the attached parameter file 
; and return in 16 minutes, or download it from one of the FOTD 
; web sites at:
; 
;         <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and:
; 
;         <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Tuesday here at Fractal Central was eminently average.  The 
; partly cloudy sky, temperature of 46F 8C and moderate northwest 
; wind made the cats act like average 13-year-old cats while they 
; were out in the yard in the afternoon.  Considering the behavior 
; of average 13-year-old cats, this leaves little room for action.
; 
; Today looks like a repeat with even less sun.  I expect the duo 
; will have a similar day.  As for me, I've got some work to wrap 
; up before that 4-day holiday begins tomorrow.  Until next FOTD, 
; take care, and one of these years I'll decide to devote my full 
; time to fractals.  See you in 24 hours.
