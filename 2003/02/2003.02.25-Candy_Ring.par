; FOTD -- February 25, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is one of the grainiest of all time.  The parent 
; fractal is nothing more than a symmetrical pair of fragmented 
; arcs, with little that appears to hold promise.  The arcs do 
; contain midgets however, and some of them are shaped most 
; unusually.  But for today's FOTD I have chosen a perfectly 
; normal quadratic midget.
; 
; I named the picture "Candy Ring".  The ring of brightly colored 
; spots surrounding the midget reminds me of a dish of candy that 
; a child would love to dive into.  The pattern around the midget 
; is quite ephemeral, and quite dependent on the chosen palette of 
; colors.  Without a carefully chosen palette, the entire image 
; deteriorates to a featureless expanse of fractal sand.
; 
; The rating of 5 is nondescript.  The image is neither good nor 
; lacking.  It simply exists, a mathematical abstraction that has 
; never before been seen and never again will be seen.  But this 
; might not be totally true.  If the universe is infinite, there 
; are an infinity of fractalists sitting at an infinity of 
; computers viewing this same image at this very moment.  Of 
; course, there is no such thing as this very moment throughout 
; the universe, but that's relative, and therefore another story.
; 
; I am getting letters asking the status of the FOTD-CD, and when 
; it will be ready for distribution.  The disk is basically 
; finished.  The material is gathered into one huge directory and 
; ready to be copied onto a CD.  The problem is that my artistic 
; nature is exerting itself.  I am not yet satisfied with the 
; disk.  I want it to be better -- as good as possible.
; 
; I originally had planned to include on the disk the short 
; stories I have written over the past 20 years or so.  The 
; stories are still ready to go onto the CD, but I have developed 
; grave doubts about their worth.  I would rather be known as a 
; good fractalist than a marginal want-to-be writer.
; 
; I also had originally planned to include on the disk the heated 
; philosophical debates that I have had over the years with both 
; believers and skeptics.  These are also ready to go, but the 
; more I think about this, the less I like the idea.  The CD 
; should be a fun thing, not a forum for fruitless and sometimes 
; angry debate over things such as religion.
; 
; Another hold-up is that I have been unable to locate a group of 
; my earliest images, dating from way back in the late 1980's.  
; They are not great, and their lack will have little impact on 
; the CD as a whole, but they show how I got started on my 
; insatiable quest for fractals.
; 
; Another problem is the names of the GIF images, which are 
; currently cryptic 8-letter DOS abbreviations of the longer full 
; names of the images.  The people who have tested the disk format 
; have had trouble connecting the images with the corresponding 
; discussions.  (Would you know, while scanning a list of 30 GIF 
; files, that the 'tmeandva.gif' image goes with the 'Theme and 
; Variations' discussion?)
; 
; I could solve this confusion by renaming the images so that the 
; names correspond to the dates of their discussions, or by 
; breaking down the current large monthly directories into 30 
; smaller daily ones, with one discussion and one image in each 
; sub-directory.  Either option would be a sizable task.  Since 
; Fractint is a DOS program, I want to keep the disk in DOS 
; format, like the great disk that came with the second edition 
; of "Fractal Creations".
; 
; With all the other work that I have to do, it might be necessary 
; to put the ongoing FOTD on hiatus while I wrap up the CD.  
; Hopefully it will not be necessary. . . . but we'll see . . .
; 
; On my machine, today's image requires almost 1/2 hour to render 
; from the parameter file.  Much time can be saved by downloading 
; the completed image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather was quite pleasant here at Fractal Central 
; on Monday, with quite a bit of sun and a temperature of 44F 7C.  
; Only the remaining snowpack prevented the duo from enjoying a 
; romp in the yard.
; 
; As for myself, I have a pile of graphic work to do, a leak to 
; get patched, a basement to get dried, a fallen porch roof to get 
; replaced, a FOTD-CD to wrap up, tomorrow's FOTD to find, and a 
; pair of cats to keep happy.  In addition, the central heat is 
; acting up, probably because of the wet basement.  All in all, it 
; is just another normal day at Fractal Central, so until next 
; time, take care, and when things are as bad as they could 
; possibly be, barring the appearance of Murphy's law, they can 
; only get better.
