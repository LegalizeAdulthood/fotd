; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's less-than-stellar image "Stuff" because it is a 
; good illustration of the fragmented bits and pieces of 
; something, or perhaps nothing, that I call fractal 'stuff'.  
; This stuff is not material, since it has no physical basis; yet 
; it is not a total abstraction, since it can easily be rendered 
; and visualized.  It is just 'stuff', and that is what I have 
; always considered it.
; 
; The exponent of Z in the generating formula is 1.559612.  I 
; chose this number because 1.559612^1.559612 almost equals 2.  
; (1.559611 is closer.) This fact has little significance in the 
; appearance of the resulting fractal, and was chosen on a whim.
; 
; Luckily, the image renders in only a few minutes, for I could 
; honestly rate it no higher than an abysmal 3.  But it is still 
; worth a quick glance.  As always, the GIF file has been posted 
; to:

;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and to:

; 
; While rummaging around in the attic yesterday, I came upon the 
; dried-out remnants of a toy chemistry set that I had played with 
; long ago and then grown tired of.  I have no idea how it got 
; there, for I have moved several times since I received it as a 
; Christmas gift back in the years when I was filled with wonder 
; and just discovering science.  (I also had a toy microscope, a 
; toy telescope, a toy weather station, an erector set that was 
; supposed to build a walking robot, [I never managed to get the 
; robot constructed.], and all the other goodies that boys who 
; have decided to become scientists enjoy.)
; 
; As fate would have it, I never became a 'scientist', whatever 
; one of them is.  I almost accidentally became involved in the 
; printing trade and eventually became a graphic designer.  But I 
; have never lost that sense of scientific wonder.
; 
; However, since those early years, I have become familiar with 
; relativity and quantum theory.  As a result, I now wonder more 
; than anything else about the philosophical basis of science.  
; Where I once wondered what the moon is made of, I now wonder if 
; the physical world actually is an 'objective reality' or if 
; 'reality' is an attribute we have invented for convenience and 
; then bestowed upon the aggregate of our sensual impressions.  
; And I wonder whether it makes a difference.
; 
; The star Sirius is 8 light years away.  When I was much younger, 
; this meant that if something were to happen at this moment on 
; that star, we would not know about it for 8 years, because it 
; would take 8 years for the information to reach us.  Then I 
; became interested in relativity and found that there is no such 
; thing as a universal present moment of time.  The phrase 'at 
; this moment on that star' has different meanings for different 
; observers.  Instead of thinking that our present moment of time 
; now exists at the position of the star, but due to the finite 
; speed of light, we on earth are seeing the star as it existed 8 
; years ago, we can just as accurately think that we are seeing 
; the star as it presently exists and the actual time at the star 
; is now 8 years in the future, and it will take us 8 years to 
; reach that future time.
; 
; So at this moment, what time actually exists on the star Sirius? 
; The question cannot be answered.  Time is relative.  Asking such 
; a question is like asking someone to find the center of the 
; surface of a featureless sphere.  All that can be said is that 
; wherever a particular observer is located, that observer will 
; find himself in his own private present moment of time.
; 
; And what does this ambiguity of time mean to us in our everyday 
; lives?  It means nothing at all -- that is unless we begin 
; traveling around our galactic vicinity at a velocity which is a 
; sizeable percentage of the velocity of light.  When (and if) 
; this time comes, we will find ourselves faced with such present-
; day absurdities as having a twin who was born at the same time 
; as ourselves, yet is 20 years older or younger.  But when this 
; happens, the absurdities will not be absurd at all.
; 
; This relativistic situation might seen weird enough, but 
; relativity at least leaves us with a real world, objectively out 
; there to serve as a firm foundation for the science we have 
; developed over thousands of years.  This is more than quantum 
; theory does when it brings into question the very existence of 
; objective reality.
; 
; With ample sun and a temperature of 41F 5C, the weather was 
; quite pleasant here at F.C. on Sunday.  Had the ground not been 
; snow-covered, the dynamically fractal cats would have had a 
; great day in the yard.  As it was, they had a not-quite-as-great 
; day on the porch, chasing the few sunbeams that are just 
; beginning to reach there.  Today is starting cloudy and colder, 
; with on-and-off periods of light snow.  The duo will not enjoy 
; this.
; 
; I'll enjoy the day better when I finish the work, and I will not 
; finish until I resume it, so until next time, take care, and 
; never lose that sense of wonder, but be careful what you wonder 
; about.
