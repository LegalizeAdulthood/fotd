; FOTD -- February 13, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a blow-up of a midget that lies on the filament 
; extending outward from the main valley of yesterday's 'Fido' 
; image.  Since this valley forms the eyes of the dog's head, I 
; named the image "In the Dog's Eye".
; 
; The image is one of the best scenes I have yet found in the 
; fractured fractals with an exponent of Z between 1 and 2.  I 
; rated it at an honest 7.  Most of the rating is earned by the 
; < tdis > option, which colored the image.  The image is unusu-
; ally detailed, and benefits greatly by being rendered at a high 
; resolution.
; 
; An unusual feature of today's fractal is the trip out from it 
; back to the surface of its parent.  As the outzoom progresses, 
; one attractive fractal scene after another comes into view.  
; Several of these larger scenes could just as well have qualified 
; as today's FOTD, but I chose the deepest one I could safely 
; reach.
; 
; On my aging Pentium 200mhz machine the parameter file renders in 
; 7 minutes.  On a faster machine it will render in less time.  
; But the fastest way of all to see the image is to download it 
; from Paul's FOTD web site at:

;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:

; 
; As I wrote two days ago, when I read the book "Relativity and 
; Common Sense" by Hermann Bondi, I was forced to change the way I 
; thought about the universe at large.  No longer could I assume 
; that the laws of the limited part of the world which I observed 
; through my limited senses were valid over the vast range of 
; physical existence.  But even though the vast physical universe 
; worked differently than my limited sensory input led me to 
; assume, it was still out there, solid and real, regardless of 
; whether it was being observed, a firm foundation upon which the 
; discipline of science had been built.
; 
; After fascinating myself with the curiosities of relativity, I 
; turned to quantum mechanics, went to the local library, and read 
; as many books as I could find which I was able to understand.  
; To begin, I found far fewer popularized books of QM.  This is 
; because QM is so strange that it is difficult to accurately 
; express in everyday words.
; 
; I discovered that the tiny microscopic world is far stranger 
; than the vast world of relativity.  QM can be fully described 
; only by arcane mathematics, and can be fully grasped only by 
; those who understand the math.  I found that there are several 
; interpretations of what the math means, and that the leading 
; interpretation is, (or was at that time), the Copenhagen 
; Interpretation.  This interpretation states (as best I could 
; understand it) that at the atomic level there is no reality -- 
; that reality is somehow created when a quantum thing is 
; measured.
; 
; Now my curiosity was really aroused.  The physical world is 
; real, I thought.  My senses show me that it is really out there. 
; I can see it and hear it.  Even in the dark, when I cannot see 
; or hear things, I know they are still there because I can feel 
; them when I bump into them.  And what about things that really 
; happened when no one was there to observe them, such as the 
; formation of earth's moon?
; 
; It made no sense at all.  How can real physical objects be built 
; of electrons, protons and neutrons that are not real?  A house 
; cannot be built of imaginary bricks.  Either the atoms must be 
; real or the objects must be unreal. Was the science that I 
; admire based on an illusion?  And I found other quantum things 
; that seemed absolutely impossible.  I found that a single object 
; (if quantum things are objects) can be in more than one place at 
; a single moment of time.  I found that quantum information can 
; be transmitted instantaneously over any distance, faster than 
; light, which relativity had just told me was impossible.  I 
; found that sub-atomic things can go forward, backward, or even 
; sideways in time.
; 
; In short, I found that the universe is not only stranger that I 
; imagined, it is stranger than I could possibly imagine.  And 
; even more telling, I found that not even the quantum experts 
; know what is going on down there.  There are many competing 
; interpretations of QM, with the ultimate goal being to reduce 
; the quantum world to something that resembles our everyday 
; world, where space is filled with real, spatially separated 
; objects, and time flows forward in a straight line.
; 
; When I realized how weird the world as described by science had 
; become, the world as described by religious mystics, which I 
; had recently decided was imaginary, seemed ordinary by 
; comparison.  This realization marked the beginning of the end 
; of my days as a materialistic, Atheistic skeptic.
; 
; If I continue this thread, it will be only on the philofractal 
; list.  Now let's get on to that all-important weather.
; 
; Sun and cold winds prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Wednesday.  The sun tried hard, but the snow-covered ground and 
; temperature of 26F -3C were too much for it to overcome.  As a 
; result, the fractal cats endured another day of semi-voluntary 
; confinement.  The ultimate insult came in the evening, when I 
; discovered the cats' food shelf devoid of tuna.  They satisfied 
; themselves with a few slices of left-over turkey that I managed 
; to dredge up.
; 
; I see work beside me and the clock on the wall overhead ticking 
; all too fast.  I had best get busy doing what needs to be done.  
; Until next time, take care, and if nothing is real, what am I.
