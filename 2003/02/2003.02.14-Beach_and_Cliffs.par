; FOTD -- February 14, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's spectacularly colored image lies near the tip of the 
; main filament of the fractal that is drawn by the MandelbrotBC1 
; formula when the real(p2) parameter is not changed from zero.  
; This figure does not fit on the default screen, and the filament 
; extends even farther beyond the border, to the north and west.
; 
; Midgets of Mandeloids in the exponent range between 1 and 2, 
; such as today's, have a curious characteristic that is well 
; displayed in today's image.  Parts of their shoreline form 
; broad, gently sloping beaches, while other parts form sheer 
; cliffs.  The northern edges of today's midget are in the form of 
; broad, flat, high-iteration beaches, which I have colored 
; brilliant yellow.  The southern edges form sheer cliffs, where 
; the duller, low-iteration, outside material directly abuts the 
; water.  I named the image ""Beach and Cliffs" when I noticed the 
; clarity of this contrast.
; 
; This same beach-cliff effect also exists in the normal quadratic 
; midgets, though it is far less noticeable.  In quadratic 
; midgets, the East Valley area represents the sheer cliffs, while 
; the area where the main stem joins the main body of the midget 
; represents the flat beaches, where the iteration count becomes 
; very high, and images take a long time to render.
; 
; Though the coloring of today's image is spectacularly intense, 
; it was achieved with the aid of an additional graphics program, 
; and therefore is artificial.  Combined with the commonplace 
; nature of the midget, this drops the rating from a 7 to the 
; present 6, which is still a bit above average.
; 
; The render time of 5-1/2 minutes on my 200mhz machine is just 
; about proper for an image that rates just a little above 
; average.  The image may be seen faster by downloading it from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Before moving on to the all-unimportant weather, I must find 
; what kind of a demand there will be for the much-heralded FOTD 
; CD-ROM, so that I will know whether it will be worth the effort 
; of having it mass-produced.  (which I doubt)  The disk is 
; basically finished, and will contain every FOTD image from the 
; start of the series in April 1997 to the end of December 2002, 
; plus many earlier images and some extra controversial philosoph-
; ical discussions.  I currently plan on selling the disks for 20 
; dollars.  If you would purchase a disk at this price, drop me a 
; letter at my mindspring e-mail address.
; 
; Cold temperatures, clouds and biting winds prevailed all day 
; Thursday here at Fractal Central.  The temperature of 28F -2C 
; was far too chilly for sensitive paws and whiskers, so the 
; fractal duo spent the day indoors, wishing they could be more 
; comfortable outside.  Luckily, by the time evening arrived, the 
; tuna had been restocked.  The treat raised the duo's spirits 
; notably.  Today is starting cold again, and more snow is 
; forecast for the week-end.  I fear much more tuna will be 
; required.
; 
; I also fear that if I fail to start the day's tasks, I will 
; never finish before the forecasted snowstorm arrives.  (which 
; they often never do)  So until 24 hours from now, when the next 
; glorious FOTD will appear, take care, and wait patiently.
