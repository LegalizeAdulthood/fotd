; FOTD -- February 01, 2003 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I tried not to see the entrance of a cave in today's image, it 
; appeared so trite, but there it is, clear as can be, a view from 
; inside a cave, looking out toward an unearthly scene and the 
; alien blue sky beyond.  There are even puddles of liquid 
; nitrogen on the cave floor, reflecting bits of the scene beyond. 
; With all this evidence, I had no choice but to name the image 
; "The Cave Entrance".  I rated the image at an 8 because of its 
; unusually strong resemblance to an actual 3-D scene.  The colors 
; are a bit surreal, but this doesn't detract from the impression 
; of a real scene.
; 
; The puddles of nitrogen on the cave floor are actually small, 
; foreshortened spiral areas where the iteration count of the 
; surface features becomes greater than the count of the features 
; beneath, and the normally hidden features show through.  These 
; areas resemble reflections because the features showing through 
; are extensions of the features directly above.
; 
; To create today's image, I once again used the C4G almost-
; triternion formula.  While searching the East Valley area of a 
; square Mandeloid, I noticed today's curious feature in the 
; pattern around a sub-midget.  A zoom-in, a bit of stretching, a 
; bit of rotation and a bit of skewing produced today's image.
; 
; Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the image is the criss-
; crossing elements that appear to go on indefinitely, almost 
; invisibly, in the distant blue of the sky.  When enlarged and 
; re-colored, this distant sky area changes and becomes another 
; cave entrance.  We literally have a cave whose entrance goes on 
; forever.
; 
; Luckily, the parameter file runs in far less time than forever.  
; In fact, even on my worn-out machine with the balky fan it runs 
; in 8 minutes, and draws an image well worth the short wait.  And 
; even that short wait can be avoided if the completed GIF file of 
; the image is downloaded from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Friday remained cold, damp and dreary all day, with the tempera-
; ture hovering just above freezing and occasional drizzle.  The 
; cats remained gloomy all day, and needed a treat of tuna in the 
; evening to make them fit to live around.  Today looks like 
; another repeat.  I have no idea how the duo will take three 
; indoor days in a row.
; 
; With most of the work caught up and not much else to do, I'm 
; going to take today as easy as possible.  I'll probably spend a 
; good part of the day somewhere in Fractal Land, searching for 
; tomorrow's FOTD.  Until then, take care, and prepare for the 
; imminent release of the long-awaited FOTD CD, which will contain 
; every FOTD image from April 1997 through December 2002, plus 
; every FOTD discussion and a lot of spurious blather.  It will 
; also contain a number of my earlier fractal images, some of them 
; created (blasphemy) by programs other than Fractint.
