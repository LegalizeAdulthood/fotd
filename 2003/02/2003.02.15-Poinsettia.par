; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; 'What is reality?' philosophers wonder.  Is reality an indepen-
; dent objective thing, or is it something largely determined by 
; the particular culture in which a person happens to live?
; 
; 'What is a fractal?' I wonder.  Is a fractal a real thing or an 
; imaginary thing made visible by a computer?  Certain physical 
; objects such as coastlines have a fractal nature, but can the 
; fractal nature be separated from the object and still be consid-
; ered real?  Can a smile be separated from a face, or a mind from 
; a brain?
; 
; Today's image consists of trapped and evaporated inside stuff 
; made visible by the < bof61 > inside fill option.  Does this 
; make it any more or less real than traditional images that 
; consist of outside stuff rendered with equal-escape bands?  It 
; all depends on how the word 'real' is defined.
; 
; If 'real' is taken to mean 'composed of objective physical 
; matter', then all fractals created by computers are unreal.  If 
; 'real' is taken to mean 'observable by the senses', then visual 
; fractals, and fractal music as well, are quite real.  If we 
; agree with the latter definition, and since it is observable, 
; both on the screen and printed on a sheet of paper, today's 
; image must be considered real.  Most importantly, would I have 
; concerned myself all these years with something that is not real?
; 
; Today's image most certainly is real.  I named it "Poinsettia" 
; because it reminds me of one of those plants with red leaves 
; resembling flower petals, which are in demand around Christmas 
; time.  As noted above, it is an evaporated scene made visible by 
; < bof61 > inside fill.
; 
; The parent fractal consists of three vertically stacked bays, 
; with the north bay partially obscured by several intruding, 
; apparently non-critical valleys.  But once again, appearances 
; are deceiving, for today's scene lies on the west shore of the 
; intruding valley on the east, which proves to have a few 
; critical features in it after all.
; 
; I could rate the image no higher than an average 5.  There's 
; nothing really wrong with it, there's simply nothing in it that 
; I could focus on to justify a higher rating.
; 
; With a render time of 6/10 second under 15 minutes on my 
; machine, the parameter file is decidedly slow.  Speed may be 
; achieved by downloading the completed GIF image from Paul's web 
; site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Clouds and sun combined with an unexpectedly mild temperature of 
; 40F 4C to give the cats a jolly afternoon on the porch Friday 
; afternoon.  Their moods were so good in fact that I had no need 
; to break out the tuna.  But this morning is colder with 6cm of 
; fresh snow on the ground, snow still falling, and a forecast of 
; a blizzard.  The task of keeping them in a good mood throughout 
; the day will be more difficult.
; 
; As for me, I'm going to think of clearing the sidewalks.  I 
; might even decide to do it.  Until next time, take care, and 
; patience will soon be rewarded.
