; FOTD -- February 20, 2003 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yesterday morning, the fractal lady decided she simply had to 
; make a trip to the store.  I warned her that the roads were 
; still very bad, and if she went out, she would get stuck.  She 
; assured me that she could handle it.  About an hour later I got 
; a phone call from six blocks away.  Guess what had happened . . .
; 
; Two hours later, when we arrived back at F.C., I justifiably 
; lost my cool, which I have relatively little of even on good 
; days.  The rest need not be described.
; 
; The fractal of the day, which was found despite the distrac-
; tions, is named "Mandelbrot Breakoff".  The name describes the 
; disconnected nature of the scene.  The rating of 4 is fair 
; enough for such an ordinary fractal.  The render time of under 3 
; minutes is also fair enough.  Those who consider even 3 minutes 
; unfair may download the completely rendered GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:

; 
; The fractal weather Wednesday was not too bad, with some sun and 
; a temperature of 36F 2C.  The dynamic cats were out of sight 
; most of the day, most likely avoiding the temper tantrums.  It 
; would have made no difference even if they had not gone into 
; hiding.  Their porch is still blocked by the fallen roof and the 
; ground is still buried under about a meter of soggy snow.
; 
; But F.C. has a way of surviving trying times, and the next 
; fractal is but 24 hours off.  Until then, take care, and I just 
; don't dig it.
