; FOTD -- February 07, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I notice a letter on the Fractint list requesting the method of 
; running the parameter files that I attach to the FOTD 
; discussions.  The process is simple.  First, save the entire 
; FOTD message in the Fractint directory as a pure text file with 
; a .par extension.  Be sure no lines wrap around and no extra 
; characters (such as =3d) are inserted into the text by your 
; e-mail reader.  Then load Fractint and run the saved parameter 
; file as you would any other parameter file.  If all goes well, 
; and it usually but not always does, the image will begin 
; rendering, and when it is finished, can be explored like any 
; other fractal.
; 
; Today's image runs from the attached parameter file in 17 
; minutes on my machine at a resolution of 640x480x256.  It is 
; another of my evaporated images, and a very good one at that.  
; The formula that created the image combines 12 negative parts of 
; Z^(-1.6) with 9 negative parts of Z^(-10), then adds 1/C instead 
; of C.  The 1/C turns the normally inside-out parent fractal 
; inside-out again, which results in a rightside-out fractal.
; 
; In its un-evaporated form, this parent is a large, indescribable 
; main open area, with many bays and estuaries, and a smaller, 
; cut-off, more-Mandel-shaped figure to the east.  The main bud of 
; this cut-off feature is split down the middle by a spurious 
; valley.  Today's scene is located near the end of a filament 
; extending from a bud on the shoreline of this valley, very near 
; the point where the filament terminates in a large, oval open 
; area.  For this particular image, I used the MandelbrotMix2 
; formula rather than the MandelbrotMix4.
; 
; Finding the name for today's image was easy.  The detail in the 
; converging arms so closely resembles the tendrils of a vine that 
; the name "Fractal Tendrils" came almost automatically.  
; Considering the unusually close resemblance of the fractal image 
; to an actual physical object, the rating of a 7 is well 
; justified.
; 
; I have long considered the names I give to my fractal images.  
; Fractals are abstract things, so should they be given the names 
; of the physical things which, in my opinion, they resemble?  
; Perhaps I should invent clever sounding nonsense words and 
; phrases to serve as names for my images.  I briefly considered a 
; name such as "Vineroptera" for today's image.
; 
; A whole new situation arises with languages other than English.  
; For example, the Julibrot, which I explore so often, when 
; translated into German, means something like "Bread of July" -- 
; an interesting title, but one with little to do with the four-
; dimensional object in question.
; 
; As I mentioned earlier, the parameter file of today's image 
; renders in 17 minutes.  That time may be cut to a minute or so 
; by going to Paul's web site at"
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or to Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and downloading the pre-rendered GIF image file from there.
; 
; The clouds increased all day Thursday here at Fractal Central, 
; but the snow held off until after dark.  The high temperature of 
; 34F 1C was quite chilly for the sensitive whiskers of the 
; dynamic duo.  The extra outing I gave them right before sunset 
; will have to hold them for a few days, for the snow is still 
; falling lightly this morning, with 7in 18cm on the ground.
; 
; Luckily for me, the work is not piling up as fast as the snow.  
; In fact, I should have most of it behind me by lunch time.  That 
; will leave me with nothing to do but watch the snow and search 
; for the next FOTD.  Until tomorrow, take care, and be of stout 
; mind and slim body.
