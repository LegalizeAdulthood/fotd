; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The exponent of Z in today's image -- 1.5596104695 -- is a 
; slightly more accurate refinement of the exponent that created 
; yesterday's lowly image.  This number, when raised to the power 
; of itself, comes as close to exactly equaling 2 as is possible 
; to calculate on my 10-digit pocket calculator.
; 
; The difference in the resulting parent fractal is insignificant. 
; The improvement in image quality is a result of my better 
; fractal luck, plus a bit of skill.  Today's scene could just as 
; easily have been found in yesterday's parent fractal, if I had 
; searched for it in today's area.  The numbers create the fractal 
; universe; the fractalist must find the goodies in the universe.
; 
; I named the image "The Key".  I have no idea what the key is 
; supposed to unlock.  It could be the door to enlightenment, the 
; door to wonder, the door to mystery, or my favorite door -- the 
; door to reality.  Unfortunately, even though I now have the key, 
; I have yet to find the door, so the mystery will remain 
; unanswered.
; 
; The parent of today's image resembles a mis-shapen M-set, with 
; its nose pointed southwest.  Today's scene is located in the 
; 'East Valley' of this M-set, which is located off-center on the 
; north-northeast shore of the main bay.  The little midget at the 
; center, shining golden in its isolation, was discovered entirely 
; by luck.  I found it by toggling into and out of color-cycling 
; mode and searching for points on the screen that blinked.  I 
; often use this trick when searching for midgets, but in order 
; for it to work, the inside must be set to the number zero, which 
; in turn must be set to a very dark shade.
; 
; In fractals of this exponent range, there are very few clues to 
; the location of midgets.  Sometimes a convergence of discontinu-
; ities points to the midgets, sometimes not.  Sometimes I simply 
; get a feeling that a certain feature holds a midget, and some-
; times I am right.
; 
; The rating of an above average 6 shows that midgets which exist 
; in fractals with exponents of Z in the range between 1 and 2 
; need not be the nearly hopeless jumble of disorganized bits and 
; pieces that spoiled yesterday's image.
; 
; The render time of 8 minutes is a bit excessive for an image 
; which, even though it rates 3 points above the image of the day 
; before, is still only slightly above average.  The good news is 
; that the wait to see the image can be largely eliminated by 
; downloading the pre-rendered GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; As I mentioned in yesterday's discussion, when I became familiar 
; with the consequences of relativity, I was forced to give up the 
; comfortable and intuitive world image that I, along with most 
; everyone else, had developed in the formative years.  No longer 
; could I consider time and space to be two separate things.  I 
; now needed to see them as two different ways of seeing the same 
; thing -- spacetime.  No longer could I assume that the present 
; moment of time exists throughout the universe.  There could be 
; no universal moment of time any more than there could be a uni-
; versal point of space.  Distance and time no longer had absolute-
; ly fixed measurements.  Mass turned out to be a different form 
; of energy, and mass also was no longer fixed.  And most impor-
; tantly, at least to me, was the realization that the universe is 
; actually four-dimensional.
; 
; But when I discovered relativity, the world, as strange and 
; counter-intuitive as it had become, was still out there, real 
; and almost solid.  It seemed counter-intuitive only because in 
; our day-to-day lives we experience such an infinitesimally small 
; range of its vast extent.
; 
; Then I became interested in quantum mechanics, and my philosophi-
; cal problems grew far greater but far more interesting.  If all 
; goes well, I'll discuss this tomorrow.  At this point I will say 
; only that anything based on the assumption of the existence of 
; an independent, objectively real world is opened to cross-exami-
; nation by the implications of Q.M.
; 
; The occasional light snow continued most of the day Monday here 
; at F.C.  It never amounted to much, but with the temperature at 
; freezing, was just enough to keep the dynamic ones confined to 
; quarters, wishing for better things.  The better things eventual-
; ly appeared in the form of a tuna treat.  Today is starting 
; sunny but very cold, with deep snow on the ground.  It remains 
; to be seen how the duo will react.
; 
; I see it's past time for me to get busy, so until tomorrow, take 
; care, and wonder about what to wonder about.
