; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is named "Irregular Minibrot".  The reason for 
; the name is the shape of the midget and the irregularity of the 
; features around it.  The midget is irregular because instead of 
; iterating Z^2, I iterated Z^sqrt(2) and chose a spot 14.142 
; levels down the logarithmic spiral to do the rendering.
; 
; When this low a power of Z is iterated to make a fractal, the 
; results are totally unpredictable.  Mandeloids generally have a 
; number of lobes one less than the exponent of Z in the 
; generating expression.  Thus the formula Z^5+C draws a Mandeloid 
; with 4 lobes, and the Z^2+C Mandeloid, which is the classic 
; Mandelbrot set, has one lobe.  Following this progression, the 
; Z^1.4142 Mandeloid has only 0.4142 lobe, less than half a lobe, 
; but there is no easy rule determining which fraction of a single 
; lobe will appear either in the parent fractal or in the midgets 
; it contains.
; 
; Theoretically, today's midget is only less than half there.  Its 
; buds are smaller than those of the classic M-set and more widely 
; spaced.  In addition, the buds are in the wrong places and mis-
; shapen as well.  There are several smaller midgets in the image, 
; which are easily found by toggling into and out of color mode.  
; Some of these may also be interesting.  I have not checked to 
; see.
; 
; With all its imperfections, today's FOTD makes an interesting 
; image, though not interesting enough to rise above the rating of 
; an average 5 that I gave it.  The render time of 7 minutes is 
; fair enough for such a mediocre image, and most of that time can 
; be saved by downloading the fully-rendered GIF image from one of 
; the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather remained sunny all day Saturday here at Fractal 
; Central, but the temperature of 25F -4C proved far too extreme 
; for the whiskers of the cats, who poked their noses out the door 
; only long enough to sample the chill and determine that they did 
; not want to be outside.  Today is starting warmer, but it is 
; cloudy, so the effect on the dynamic duo will likely be the same.
; 
; I have nothing much planned for the day, other than exploring 
; Fractal Land that is, so I'll take it an hour at a time.  Until 
; next FOTD, take care, and can the shape of fractals be 
; influenced by the power of thought?
