; FOTD -- February 06, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Somewhere in the world, today is Waitangi day.  I have no idea 
; where it is celebrated or what a waitangi is.  I assume that by 
; mentioning a waitangi, I am not offending any ethnic group and 
; thereby violating the rules of political correctness.  So to all 
; for whom it has significance, Happy Waitangi Day, or if the day 
; is celebrated in the far east where the date has already passed, 
; Happy Belated Waitangi Day.
; 
; Today's fractal is named "Hairybrot".  I gave it this name when, 
; after studying the image for several minutes, half closing my 
; eyes and all that kind of stuff, I could see nothing but a 
; fractal pattern with porcupine-like hairs sticking out of it.
; 
; The parent fractal is the same as yesterday's, with the slight 
; exception that I changed the portion of Z^3.5 from 3.67 to 3.7.  
; Today's scene lies in the suburbs of a larger midget in the East 
; Valley area of a small Mandelbrot set that lies just beyond the 
; southern point of the shapeless main bay of the parent.
; 
; Like yesterday's image, today's image features disconnected 
; elements, which normally indicate a non-critical area.  But 
; fractals don't seem to care about what is normal, and despite 
; the surface appearance, the tiny midget is there at the center 
; in all its unseen glory.
; 
; I included the mathtolerance entry in the parameter file because 
; the magnitude of the image is so great that it might otherwise 
; render incorrectly.
; 
; The rating of an average 5 reflects my current feelings about 
; the image.  Others may consider the image worth a higher or 
; lower rating.  The render time of 9 minutes can be avoided by 
; downloading the pre-rendered GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Wednesday passed uneventfully here at Fractal Central.  The 
; dynamic fractal cats did not complain too loudly, though it was 
; obvious that they would have preferred a temperature quite a bit 
; warmer than the high of 34F 1C.  At the end of the day I 
; rewarded them for their patience with a treat of tuna.  Today is 
; starting just as cold, with clouds moving in and a threat of 
; snow.  If the duo have any plans at all of going outside, they 
; had best do it early.
; 
; My immediate plans involve finishing the work and finding a 
; fractal for tomorrow's FOTD that would be above average.  And 
; this isn't Lake Wobegon, where every child is above average.  
; This is the 'real' world, where only half of any distribution 
; can be above average (more correctly, above the median).  Until 
; tomorrow, take care, and, unless it is politically incorrect, 
; search for that waitangi.
