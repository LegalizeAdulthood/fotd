; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is yet another of my evaporated ones, created this 
; time by subtracting a portion of Z^(-7.17) from an equal portion 
; of Z^(-1.717) before adding 1/C.  The scene was then 
; 'evaporated' by raising the bailout radius to one-googol and 
; rendering the resulting blank screen with the inside option set 
; to < bof61 >.
; 
; The real(p3) parameter is so awkward because its value was 
; determined using the evolver feature.  I use this feature in my 
; fractal travels more often than is apparent, but in most cases I 
; round off the value to something more aesthetic.  In today's 
; case, I was searching for the point where the entire fractal 
; expands to infinity and returns from the opposite direction, and 
; once I had found this point with the evolver, I did not bother 
; with the rounding.
; 
; Infinity is a curious concept, in some ways quite counter-
; intuitive.  The arithmetic of infinity is very simple -- 
; regardless of what is done to it, infinity remains unchanged.  
; When geometry is expanded to infinity, some even more surprising 
; things happen.  An infinitely long line has a single point at 
; infinity.  It does not have the two points that intuition would 
; demand.
; 
; This can be better understood by thinking of two infinitely long 
; parallel lines lying in a flat Euclidian plane, which can be 
; considered either as never intersecting or as intersecting at 
; infinity.  (This is two different ways of saying the same 
; thing.)  Then imagine a finite point where the two lines 
; intersect.  It is only a single point, but as the lines are 
; rotated, this point of intersection moves off in one direction, 
; reaches infinity, then returns from the opposite direction.  The 
; point at infinity of the line lies in both directions.  At no 
; time during the rotation does a second point of intersection 
; magically appear.
; 
; The same situation prevails with an infinite plane, which has a 
; straight line at infinity.  Points that go off in any one 
; direction and pass beyond infinity return from the opposite 
; direction.  (Actually, we're getting into projective geometry, 
; and such a plane is actually a projective plane, but that's a 
; different topic.)  
; 
; I named today's image "Lava-Ring".  If enough imagination is 
; used, the boiling pit of molten lava can actually be seen.  But 
; since molten lava is not my favorite substance, I could rate the 
; resulting image no higher than a 5.  The 24-minute render time 
; also holds down the rating, but this wait can be avoided by 
; downloading the completed GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The snow ended by noon on Friday, but the damage had already 
; been done.  With 8 inches 20cm of ice-crystals covering the 
; yard, and a temperature around freezing, the fractal cats were 
; confined to the near side of the porch, under the cover, where 
; only a dusting of snow had settled.  With such cramped quarters 
; and cold paws, they stayed outside only a few minutes.  The snow 
; is still there this morning, so I suppose it will be another bad 
; day for the aging duo.
; 
; For me, it will be a passable day, but only if the small amount 
; of work goes well.  But regardless of how the work goes, I shall 
; return in 24 hours with the next in the near-eternal series of 
; fractals.  Until then, take care, and be kind to web-footed 
; fractals.
