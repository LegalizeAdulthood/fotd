; FOTD -- February 02, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'm depressed today.  As soon as I posted yesterday's FOTD, I 
; turned on the radio and heard the bad news.  This latest space 
; disaster has me down.  As the difficulties in the foundering 
; U.S. space program continue to add up, it is becoming ever more 
; apparent that neither I nor anyone else will live to see 
; humanity reach the stars.  It is almost as apparent to all but 
; dreamers that humanity will *never* reach the stars.
; 
; I am not shocked.  I never expected to see men actually 
; traveling to other solar systems in my lifetime, but back in the 
; 60's, when I was young and enthusiastic, (i.e. a dreamer), I 
; expected to see, before I left this world, men (and women) 
; regularly traveling to Mars, and humanity actually colonizing 
; the moon.
; 
; Now I realize that I shall never see men on Mars, and unless a 
; miracle happens, that I shall never see men even on the moon.  
; In fact, I'll consider myself lucky if I live to see the earth-
; orbiting space station completed and in full operation.  As I 
; have realized for the past 15 years or so, earth's resources are 
; limited.  The planet simply has too few resources to support 
; both an out-of-control population explosion and a workable space 
; program.  We didn't even have the resources to build the super-
; conducting-supercollider down here on earth.
; 
; The problem lies in our very nature.  We are totally dependent 
; on the environment of earth's biosphere for our continued 
; existence.  To venture into space, we will always need to take a 
; bit of that environment with us.  And we have underestimated the 
; magnitude of the task of maintaining that environment.  We have 
; put too much faith in the ability of technology to overcome our 
; natural biological limitations.
; 
; The only way humanity could ever reach deep space would be to 
; find a way to change its nature.  We would need to find a way to 
; transfer our awareness, complete with senses, to some kind of 
; artificially self-aware machines, (is artificial self-awareness 
; an oxymoron?), and travel to the stars as robust androids with 
; replaceable parts and unlimited life expectancies.  But this is 
; pure fantasy.  Before it could be done, or even considered, we 
; must determine what a self-awareness is and how it might be 
; transferred.
; 
; Since this appears to be impossible, perhaps even foolish to 
; consider, the presence of humanity in deep space appears to be 
; unachievable, and no amount of science and technology can change 
; that.
; 
; One good feature about exploring the fractal world is that it 
; consumes very little of earth's limited resources.  Today's 
; image is part of the fractal that comes into being when three 
; parts of Z^(-15) are subtracted from three parts of Z^(-1.5) and 
; 1/C is added.
; 
; It is another of my 'evaporated' images, this time brought to 
; life by the bof60 inside fill.  I named the image "Spots Before 
; the Eyes".  One glance will reveal why.  If my mood had been 
; brighter, I might have rated it a bit higher than the rating of 
; an average 5.  The render time of 16 minutes is trying, but may 
; be overcome by downloading the completed GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather was unpleasant here at Fractal Central on Saturday.  
; The sky was too cloudy, too many sprinkles of rain fell, the air 
; was too damp, the wind was too raw, and the temperature of 36F 
; 2C was too chilly.  As a result, the fractal cats were too 
; testy, and a spat broke out between them when both Thomas and 
; Tippy wanted the same spot by the heat.  But the quarrel soon 
; ended, and the duo finished the day with a conciliatory treat of 
; tuna.  Today is starting the same as yesterday.  Hopefully, the 
; cats' mood will not be as sour.
; 
; Until next FOTD, take care, and those stars keep getting farther 
; away, don't they?
