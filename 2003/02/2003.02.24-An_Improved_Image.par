; FOTD -- February 24, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's going to be a hectic day here at Fractal Central.  We have 
; the drippy roof to get patched, the musty cellar to get dried, 
; the cats to keep happy, the regular graphic work to do, and the 
; fractal exploration to hopefully get to.  There is also that 
; FOTD-CD.  I have had it almost ready for weeks, but I still keep 
; finding annoying problems with it that keep me from being 
; satisfied and deciding it is finished.  It will be ready in the 
; near future, how near, I cannot say with certainty.
; 
; With its rating of 6, today's fractal is somewhat improved over 
; the string of 4-rated images that have appeared recently.  In 
; recognition of this fact, I named the picture "An Improved 
; Image".  The curvilinear effect was achieved by rendering the 
; scene with the outside set to < imag >.
; 
; The parent fractal, which was created by subtracting 2 parts of 
; Z^(-1.8) from 2 parts of Z^(0.75) then adding (1/C), is quite 
; unusual, resembling nothing as much as a rubber duckie.  I will 
; likely return to it in the near future for a source of more 
; FOTD's.
; 
; The render time of 19 minutes is slow, but for convenience, the 
; completed image has been posted to the two FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather Sunday was changeable here at Fractal 
; Central.  The day started foggy, then rain showers arrived, 
; which changed to wet snow flurries before they ended by noon.  
; In the afternoon, high winds arose, which scattered the lawn 
; furniture, but the day ended peacefully, with clear skies and 
; diminishing winds.  The cats, who appear to be becoming 
; accustomed to less-than-perfect weather, took the day's events 
; in stride, satisfying themselves indoors with warmth and good 
; food.
; 
; I've got much work to do today, so until next time, take care, 
; and be good.
