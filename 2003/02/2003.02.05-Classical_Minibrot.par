; FOTD -- February 05, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's a bit hard to find an outstanding characteristic in today's 
; FOTD image that might serve as the basis for a name.  It's a 
; simple scene of a classic quadratic midget located in a very 
; un-classic fractal.  When nothing better came to mind, I named 
; the image "Classical Minibrot".
; 
; The parent fractal, which was created by combining portions of 
; Z^3.5 and Z^5.5, is anything but classic however.  It consists 
; of a long, narrow, large but shapeless body of open 'water' with 
; a well-defined but rather distorted M-set lying some distance 
; to the south.  
; 
; At first glance, the shapeless body appears totally non-
; critical, and therefore would not be expected to hold intact 
; midgets.  But in the world of fractals, things are not always as 
; they seem.  At least two rudimentary valleys appear on the 
; western shore of the shapeless body.  At first glance, these 
; valleys also appear as though they would hold no midgets.  The 
; appearance is deceiving.
; 
; Curious as to what other than midgets might lie in these 
; valleys, I zoomed into the southern one and focused on an 
; interesting feature.  In this feature I noticed a pair of 
; seahorse-like spirals with the symmetry that usually indicates 
; the presence of a midget.  I zoomed into the center of symmetry 
; and found today's image.
; 
; It's not a great fractal, in fact it's merely average, but it is 
; still a significant improvement over yesterday's abysmal image, 
; and if the present trend continues, we'll be back in positive 
; territory within a day.
; 
; One way to see the classical midget is to run the parameter file 
; and wait 6 minutes or so.  A faster way is to let Paul and Scott 
; render the image and download it from one of their FOTD web 
; sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Tuesday morning at Fractal Central began rainy.  It cleared 
; shortly after noon, and the temperature reached a relatively 
; mild 50F 10C, but high winds kept the fractal cats skittish, and 
; they came inside after only a few minutes in the yard.  They 
; slept by the heat for the rest of the day.  This morning is 
; starting notably colder, though the high winds have died down.  
; It's too early to say what the dynamic duo will do.
; 
; What I'm going to do is first finish a bit of work and then try 
; to find a better fractal.  I've got a few ideas of where to 
; look, but no success is guaranteed.  Whatever I find will be 
; tomorrow's FOTD.  Until then, take care, and the quest for the 
; perfect fractal might never end.
