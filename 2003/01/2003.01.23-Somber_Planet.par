; FOTD -- January 23, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The plethora of triternion formulas from various sources 
; continues to increase, though I have yet to see one that draws 
; a perfect M-set as its 0,0 default, as intuition suggests it 
; should.  Since posting variation number one of the original 
; formula, I have made four more variations.  Today's variation, 
; number five, draws a reasonably perfect default M-set, yet still 
; creates the criss-crossing elements that make these formulae so 
; interesting.
; 
; I have named today's image, which resembles a nighttime scene at 
; the edge of a fantastic forest on some dreary planet "Somber 
; Planet".  The coloring is perhaps the darkest and most somber of 
; any FOTD image, so dark in fact that the image is best viewed in 
; subdued light.  Even the reddish clouds in the distance, about 
; to be illuminated by a rising sun, are somber.
; 
; The rating of 7 is based on the curious resemblance of the image 
; to an actual scene on another planet.  A brighter color palette 
; might have earned it a higher rating, but being the type of 
; person who enjoys less-cheerful things such as slow, solemn 
; funeral music, I stuck with the dreary blue tones.
; 
; The render time of 4-1/2 minutes is not too dreary, but dreary 
; enough to make the download a better choice.  The download may 
; be found on the W.W.Web at Paul's site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Unusual cold settled into the Fractal Central area on Wednesday, 
; chilling the cats' whiskers thoroughly.  With their whiskers 
; chilled by the 20F -7C temperature when I opened the door, the 
; fractal cats didn't even think of going out.  They passed the 
; day huddled thankfully by the heat, behaving like little cat 
; angels.  Today will be even colder, so I expect a repeat.
; 
; My day will also be spent indoors, working rather than sleeping. 
; And when the work is done, I shall take a trip to Fractal Land.  
; Until tomorrow at about this same time, take care, and unless I 
; am mistaken, cat's whiskers were once a part of simple radios.
