; FOTD -- January 20 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is titled "Bad Boy".  This name does not allude to 
; a reggae song; it refers to the fact that at one point there are 
; 12 elements surrounding the central midget, which is quadratic 
; in nature and therefore not expected to have rings that consist 
; of a number of elements that is a non-integral power of 2.
; 
; The image might also be considered bad because it is unstable.  
; The slightest change in the real(p2) parameter causes the entire 
; scene to vanish.  Finally, the two satellites in the northeast 
; and southwest corners have six elements surrounding them, which 
; is another wrong number.  This image certainly earns its bad 
; reputation.  I don't know what it's going to do when they come 
; for it.
; 
; The generating formula is unusually simple.  It takes Z^3 and 
; adds somewhat more than half as much Z^5 before adding C.  The 
; resulting parent fractal is rather routine, except when the 
; value of the parameters is near today's, at which point the area 
; of the fractal where today's image lies becomes unstable.  Like 
; everything else in the world of fractals, this localized 
; instability happens because of the things numbers do.  Given the 
; nature of complex numbers, it could not be otherwise.
; 
; I rated the image at a 6, a rating that might be considered 
; generous.  The coloring is only moderately impressive, and the 
; math interest is worth only slightly more.  But then, a 6 is 
; only slightly above average, so the rating will remain.
; 
; The attached parameter file renders in under 6 minutes on my 
; tired old P200 machine, which might soon be replaced as my 
; fractal-dedicated unit.  Those who would rather not wait 6 
; minutes to see the image may download it, already completed, 
; from Paul's web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; I continue to find interesting things in variations I am 
; creating of the recently posted Tman formula.  Regardless of the 
; number of dimensions, the images are out of this world.  In 
; fact, they're in the fractal world.  Some unusual images could 
; be coming in the near-future FOTD's.
; 
; The Fractal Central weather turned milder, but remained too cold 
; on Sunday for the dynamic cats to venture outdoors.  There was 
; some sun, but also flurries of snow, and a temperature that 
; never reached freezing.  The dynamic ones were surprisingly 
; pleasant in the midst of their confinement.
; 
; Today is starting milder yet.  Could this be the day when the 
; cats' paws reach the turf of the yard?  Check in 24 hours to 
; see.  Until then, take care, and go where the fractals take you.
