; FOTD -- January 31, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It looks like it's going to be a good day here at F.C.  My luck 
; appears to have finally turned for the better.  A few minutes 
; ago I received a phone call.  Expecting a customer, I answered 
; the phone on the second ring.  But instead of a customer, I 
; heard a near-hysterical voice informing me that I had just won a 
; free three-day trip for two to Orlando in Florida.
; 
; Unfortunately, I am too busy to take a trip at this time, so I 
; told the voice to simply send the cash equivalent of a three-day 
; trip to Orlando.  I am now eagerly waiting for the money to 
; arrive, but it certainly would ease my mind if I could remember 
; entering a contest where the prize was a free trip to Orlando.
; 
; My fractal luck also appears to be on the upswing.  The latest 
; formulas in the undefined triternion series were posted to the 
; Fractint list on Thursday.  Instead of complex numbers, these 
; formulas use real numbers, but the result is the same.  While 
; noodling around with one of the formulas, I stumbled upon 
; today's image.
; 
; I could have given the image many names.  I see feathered wings 
; quite clearly.  But to keep a good thing going, I decided to end 
; the month with another nameless fractal.  (Who said fractals 
; must be named?)  Since it is the fifth such image, I attached 
; the identifier "UnNamed Fractal-V".  But, as a glance at the 
; image will show, the lack of a name does not imply a lack of 
; quality.
; 
; The parent fractal resembles a square Mandelbrot set.  And since 
; parents give birth to similar offspring, the midgets tend to be 
; square also.  The squared-off midget at the center of today's 
; image lies in the East Valley of the large midget on the main 
; stem of its parent.
; 
; Because of the unusually vividly defined square area surrounding 
; the mis-shapen midget at the center, today's fractal effort 
; rates a 7.  The render time of only 2 minutes is another good 
; feature of the image.
; 
; As always, the image may also be seen by downloading it from one 
; of the FOTD web sites:

; 
; The fractal weather Thursday was cloudy with occasional flurries 
; of snow and a temperature that hung around freezing.  The 
; fractal cats spent the day by the heat, occasionally demanding 
; food.  Their mood was barely acceptable.  Today's weather 
; promises to be a repeat, so the cats' attitude will likely be a 
; repeat also.
; 
; My mood will improve markedly when I finish the modicum of work 
; now waiting to be done, and start searching for the next FOTD.  
; Until tomorrow, take care, and is infinity an odd or even number?
