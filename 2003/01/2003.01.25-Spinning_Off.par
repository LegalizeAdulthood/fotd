; ---------
; FOTD -- January 25, 2003 (Rating 5-1/2)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In this world of multiplying triternion formulae, there is still 
; room for the MandelbrotMix4.  Today, this workhorse formula 
; carries us to the virtual world that pops into existence when 
; various portions of Z^(-1.618) and Z^(-11.48) are combined and 
; (1/C) is added.
; 
; This entire world is an oversized, fragmented fractal that is 
; indescribable in shape, but has a small open area with numerous 
; Mandeloid features.  Today's scene is located in a sub-spiral of 
; a spiral in the center of a feature that resembles a multiple 
; Seahorse Valley more than anything else.
; 
; I named the image "Spinning Off" because with its coppery 
; fringes it reminds me of an old computer animation.  (Is there 
; any such thing as an *old* computer animation?)  The original 
; animation was of a spinning disk which disintegrates into 
; coppery fractal dust as it spins.
; 
; Upon seeing the final result of the day's effort, I stepped back 
; and said, "this one deserves a rating of 6."  Then I stepped a 
; bit farther back and decided that the image rates only a 5.  I 
; finally decided on the rating of 5-1/2, which is infinitesimally 
; above average.
; 
; Today's image also can be evaporated and colored with the bof61 
; inside fill, but doing so results in a fractal a bit too chaotic 
; to be a FOTD.
; 
; The render time of 33 minutes is admittedly a bit excessive, but 
; fractal salvation is at hand, for the completed GIF image may be 
; downloaded from one of the FOTD web sites at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather remained below freezing all day Friday, while the 
; fractal cats remained by the heat sources all day.  A tempera-
; ture of 30F -1C is too cold for fractal whiskers.  The duo 
; finally came to life in the evening, when their empty stomachs 
; reminded them that food exists.  Today is only slightly warmer, 
; so I expect they will have a similar day.
; 
; As for me, I will try to avoid an imminent shopping trip, most 
; likely without success.  Luckily, I have the patience to endure, 
; and thoughts of fractals will carry me through.  Until next 
; FOTD, take care, and before we can find the answer, we must 
; know the question.
