; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Questions, questions, questions . . . a fool can ask more ques-
; tions than a wise man can answer.  I'm feeling a bit foolish 
; this morning, so I shall ask a few questions that the wise men 
; wisely brush aside.  I expect no answers, because if questions 
; such as these could be answered in an absolute manner, they 
; would long since have ceased to be asked.  Of course there is 
; always the chance that the questions *have* been answered but 
; those who still ask them have failed to recognize or will not 
; accept the answers.
; 
; Would fractals exist if there had been no intelligent beings in 
; the universe to find them?  Would the potential for fractals 
; exist if there had been no intelligent beings to invent numbers? 
; And what of numbers?  Could they exist without having been inven-
; ted by a human type of intelligence?
; 
; Things grow more complicated.  Could intelligence exist without 
; the universe?  What if a few physical constants had a different 
; value?  Does the universe exist when it is not being observed?  
; Does it exist when it *is* being observed, or is it some kind of 
; consistent illusion.  If the universe is an illusion, what is 
; having the illusion?  And if the universe is an illusion, is the 
; same illusion common to all observers, or does each observer ob-
; serve his own private world.  Are the observers also part of the 
; illusion?  Finally, the ultimate question: Why is there some-
; thing instead of nothing?
; 
; No one can give absolute answers to such questions, though many 
; hold opinions so strong that they confuse belief with knowledge 
; and consider their opinions to be fact.  And would we even want 
; to answer such questions, when doing so would take so much of 
; the fun and mystery out of life?
; 
; Regardless of the answers or non-answers to the questions, one 
; thing for certain is that we have another Fractal of the Day to 
; discuss.  It is another of my ghostly evaporated images, made 
; visible by the <bof60> inside fill.  In today's case, the evap-
; orated version proves to be better than the normal equal-itera-
; tion-band version.
; 
; The parent fractal, which was created by subtracting quite a bit 
; of minus pi from quite a lot of minus epsilon, is an oversized, 
; double-lobed Mandeloid with X-axis symmetry.  A meandering fila-
; ment extends from the northern bud, circles around to the east 
; and joins the southern bud.  Today's scene is located on a node 
; of this filament, not far from where it joins the northern bud.
; 
; I have rated the image at an 8.  This rating might be a bit 
; generous, but I'm feeling a bit contemplative this morning, and 
; want to do something to cheer myself.  I am unable to find a 
; satisfactory name for the image for the second time in three 
; days, so it enters the world as "UnNamed Fractal-II".
; 
; Ghosts come and go quickly, and today's image lives up to its 
; ghostly nature.  It renders in less than 2 minutes, about the 
; same time needed to download the completed GIF file from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal temperature never made it to 20F -7C here at F.C. on 
; Monday.  Combined with biting winds, the outdoor conditions were 
; far too rigorous for the whiskers of the dynamic ones, who 
; passed the day thankful for a warm radiator to huddle close to.  
; Today is starting cloudy and just as cold, with snow threaten-
; ing.  We'll see how the dynamic ones take the harsh cold.
; 
; Regardless of how the dynamic ones take the cold weather, I 
; shall take it quite well, especially since I expect to be out in 
; it only a few minutes.  Until next time, take care, and know 
; that fractals are mystical things that are normally invisible 
; yet can be photographed.
