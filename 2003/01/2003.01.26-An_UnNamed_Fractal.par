; FOTD -- January 26, 2003 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image has no name.  I studied it for several minutes, 
; trying to find a name for such an unfocused image that rates a 
; lowly 3, but came up with nothing.  At one time I thought I saw 
; a design for the cover of a hypothetical vampire novel, and 
; considered naming the image "Dracula".  Then I thought I would 
; name it after one of those large but less repulsive fruit bats 
; that inhabit the tropical Asian regions.  Since the image has a 
; metallic sheen about it, I also considered several metallic 
; names.  Then I remembered the invisible midget at the center, 
; and considered a name such as "Enigma".  But ultimately, all the 
; potential names proved unsatisfactory, and I let the picture 
; remain without a name.
; 
; The generating formula takes Z^(-17), adds 10 times as much 
; Z^(-1.7), then adds (1/C).  The rendering was done with the 
; outside set to < atan >, which is not one of my favorite 
; options, though in this case, it works better than the basic 
; equal-iteration bands.  (I also tried evaporating the image, 
; but found that this gives little more than chaos.)
; 
; The render time of 18 minutes is a bit excessive for such a 
; lowly image.  But relief can be found on the WWW, which hope-
; fully is recovering from the latest hack attack.  The completed 
; GIF image can be accessed at Paul's site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather was milder on Saturday, but still rather 
; cold, with a high temperature of 34F 1C.  Since no one was at 
; home most of the day, the cats passed the time sleeping by the 
; heat.  When we arrived at the door later in the evening, a loud 
; scolding was heard from the inside.  It was Thomas, who was 
; irate because he had not been fed all afternoon.  Today is a bit 
; milder yet, and no unnecessary shopping trips are planned, so 
; the dynamic duo should have a much-improved day.
; 
; Until next FOTD, which will appear in 23 hours or so, take care, 
; and go with the flow, never forgetting that those who make no 
; waves accomplish nothing.
