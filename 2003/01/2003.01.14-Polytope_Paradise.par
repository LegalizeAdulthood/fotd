; FOTD -- January 14, 2003 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; While at least one member of the Fractint list appears to 
; perhaps be losing a bit of enthusiasm for fractals, there is no 
; danger of a similar fate befalling myself.  The only thing I 
; regret is that I lack the time to explore more of the infinitely 
; infinite world of fractals.
; 
; Perhaps the first sign of impending boredom with fractals is the 
; desire to add multiple layers, as if a single-layer fractal 
; needed something to give it more interest.  Then again, perhaps 
; my devotion to single-layer fractals is an individual quirk of 
; mine, caused perhaps by my typical male tendency to concentrate 
; on one task at a time.  After all, multiple layers works very 
; well in the case of music, which is candy for the ears; why not 
; in the case of fractals, which are candy for the eyes?
; 
; I named today's image "Polytope Paradise".  I can give no 
; logical reason why I chose such a name, since a polytope is a 
; geometrical figure, existing in n-dimensional space and enclosed 
; by a finite number of planes or hyperplanes.  The strings of 
; bubbles in today's image are enclosed by curved 2-D surfaces 
; rather than planes, and therefore cannot truthfully be consid-
; ered polytopes.
; 
; As a matter of interest, the word 'polytope' was invented by 
; Alicia Boole, the daughter of logician George Boole.  In 1-space 
; and 2-space, an infinity of regular polytopes are possible.  In 
; our everyday 3-space, only 5 regular polytopes are possible.  In 
; 4-space, 6 are possible, but in 5-space and all higher spaces, 
; only 3 regular polytopes can exist.
; 
; Today's image is another ghostly one, consisting entirely of 
; trapped points whose orbits have been made visible by the bof60 
; inside fill.  The generating formula combines 1/Z and Z^(-2), 
; then adds 1/C.  The image itself rates a 6.
; 
; The render time of 41 minutes for today's image is admittedly 
; slow.  The wait can be avoided by downloading the completed GIF 
; image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The fractal weather was actually not too bad on Monday, with 
; warm sun, little wind, and a temperature of 43F 6C.  The fractal 
; cats found the outdoors reasonably comfortable.  Tippy, the lean 
; lanky tabby, spent nearly two hours in the yard.  Thomas, the 
; overweight yellow, returned indoors after one hour.  No treats 
; were needed.
; 
; Today however is much colder, and the dynamic pair will not find 
; it so pleasant out of doors.  I will not find it pleasant until 
; the work is finished.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours, so 
; take care, and see you then.
