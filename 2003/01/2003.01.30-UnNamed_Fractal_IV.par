; FOTD -- January 30, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Surrounding every Mandel midget is a basin of attraction.  The 
; midget behaves as though it wants to hold on to points that 
; start near it.  The closer to a midget a point lies, the more 
; iterations will be needed before that point escapes beyond the 
; bailout radius on its ever-accelerating but futile trip to reach 
; infinity.  Today's image, with the arms around the midget 
; appearing to descend into the purple haze of the depths, 
; illustrates this basin effect quite clearly.
; 
; I originally had named today's image "Fractal Basin".  Then it 
; struck me that the name raised images of a bathroom.  I quickly 
; changed the name to the boring one that the image now bears -- 
; "UnNamed Fractal-IV".  And why not.  We've been having a lot of 
; nameless images lately.  What harm will one more do?
; 
; When it came time to rate the image, I could attach a rating no 
; higher than an average 5.  But the image is really not all that 
; bad.  Most likely I have been spoiled by the recent spate of 
; evaporated images in the 7 and 8 range.
; 
; At one point, I actually tried to 'evaporate' today's image, but 
; much to my surprise, found that it would not evaporate, even 
; though both exponents of Z are negative.  I can only assume that 
; this is because the parent fractal is of immense size, with 
; fractal detail extending out at least as far as one-googol.
; 
; Today's scene lies near the edge of a most curious double-bayed 
; midget that lies near the edge of a larger double-bayed lake 
; that lies near the shore of an immense ocean in the hugely 
; bloated parent fractal.  The parent was generated by taking one 
; part of Z^(-1.11) and adding 0.001 part of Z^(-1000) to it, 
; then adding 1/C.
; 
; The render time of the parameter file is in the 7-minute range, 
; at least on my exhausted old machine, which BTW I have named 
; "Betsy".  The wait may be avoided by downloading the completed 
; GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The sleet and freezing rain of Wednesday morning changed to 
; light snow by noon, with a temperature that never topped 30F 
; -1C.  Only 1/2in 1cm of snow accumulated, but that was enough to 
; convince the dynamic duo that this was not to be a day for a 
; romp in the yard.  Realizing the inevitable, they endured their 
; confinement stoically.  Today is starting once again cloudy and 
; chilly.  And the snow is still around.  The duo will likely have 
; another bad day.
; 
; At least the work is light, which will give me more time to find 
; one of those elusive fractals that rate a 9.  Check in 24 hours 
; to see if I succeed.  Until then, take care, and all is not lost.
