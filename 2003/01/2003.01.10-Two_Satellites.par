; FOTD -- January 10, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To produce today's fractal, I took most of the 1's in the 
; formula of yesterday's fractal and changed them to 2's.  I had 
; no mathematical reason for doing this, I did it only for fun.  
; (I could not simply change the 1's in yesterday's real(p3) 
; parameter to 2's because doing so would have produced an 
; inferior fractal.)
; 
; When all the number-changing was finished, I had created another 
; oversized area of chaos, this one with its main Mandeloid well 
; beyond the borders of the default screen.  This Mandeloid resem-
; bles a nearly perfect M-set.
; 
; Today's scene is located in one of the rays radiating from a 
; larger midget, which lies just beyond the tip of the main stem 
; of the large Mandeloid.  Thanks mostly to the strong coloring, 
; the image rates a 7.
; 
; I named the image "Two Satellites" when I noticed the two 
; prominent areas in the corners of the image, which obviously 
; hold still smaller midgets that are beyond resolution.  The 
; render time of 7 minutes is fast enough, but downloading the 
; finished GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; will leave more time for other things.
; 
; Thursday was an exceptional day here at Fractal Central.  How 
; often does a day come in the middle of winter, with almost hot 
; sunshine and a temperature of 63F 17C? . . . Once every two or 
; three years?  The dynamic cats took advantage of the unusual 
; conditions by spending almost the entire afternoon in the yard, 
; trying to ignore the remaining puddles and mud.  Needless to 
; say, their moods were as exceptional as the weather.
; 
; Today is starting sunny but colder.  It will be harder for the 
; dynamic ones to stay happy, but they are already eager to get 
; outside and give it a try.  And as always, I have a few tasks to 
; finish, so until next FOTD, take care, and I wonder where I 
; could find a Klein bottle.
