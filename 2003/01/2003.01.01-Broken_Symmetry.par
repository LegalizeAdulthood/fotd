; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's a new year here at Fractal Central, and we start it off 
; with a sudden switch to an optimistic outlook and a trip to the 
; Z^(sqrt(2))*(0.6(C))+C fractal to find an image that rates a 7.  
; The parent fractal was drawn by the JimsCompMand formula, which 
; is simply a generalization of the cmplxmarksmand formula of 
; Fractint.
; 
; The strange little midget in the image lies in the East Valley 
; area of the largest midget on the main stem of the Z^(1.4142)+C 
; Mandeloid.  Yes, I can already hear the voices telling me that 
; the Z*(1.4142)+C Mandeloid has no main stem, that the stem 
; vanishes as the exponent of Z is dropped to a value less than 2. 
; This is true, but the parent Mandeloid of today's image is not 
; exactly the Z*(1.4142)+C figure.  In the JimsCompMand formula, 
; Z^(1.4142) was multiplied by 0.6(C) before (C) was added.  This 
; multiplication causes the fractal to split apart along the 
; negative X-axis, and this splitting causes the non-existent 
; negative stem to emerge from never-land into the world of 
; fractal reality, where it can be examined as though it had never 
; vanished.
; 
; The prominent midget is still there on the revealed stem, 
; grossly distorted of course, with its East Valley still easily 
; recognizable.  The stem itself still zig-zags down into the 
; center of the valley, and it still has midgets strung along it, 
; though at such a low power of Z, the midgets are rather 
; difficult to pick out along the zig-zagging and branching stem 
; filament.
; 
; Today's scene lies quite deep, so deep in fact that it actually 
; shows signs of breaking up, and needed the mathtolerance reset 
; to /1 to reach the magnitude.  I have included the mathtolerance 
; setting in the parameter file so that the image will draw at the 
; correct magnitude at all resolutions.
; 
; I named the image "Broken Symmetry" because of the spectacular 
; discontinuity that, along with the coloring, spoils (or makes) 
; it.  This is the one of the greatest degrees of disorder that I 
; have yet come upon, though undoubtedly an infinity of midgets 
; with even more disorder do exist and are waiting to be found.
; 
; The 13-minute render time is a bit trying, and may be avoided by 
; visiting Paul's FOTD web site at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or Scott's site at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; and downloading the completely rendered image from there.
; 
; The weather was much improved Tuesday here at F.C., with mostly 
; sunny skies, light breezes, and a temperature of 55F 13C.  The 
; small amount of dampness remaining in the yard did not deter the 
; dynamic ones from enjoying a 2-hour romp, which helped their 
; moods immensely.  In fact, they ended the day in such a pleasant 
; mood that they were satisfied with their normal diet.
; 
; But today is rainy, and I doubt that their pleasant moods can 
; weather the storm.  Check tomorrow to see how they make out.  As 
; for me, I'll probably do little more than watch football on the 
; TV.  Until next FOTD, take care, and here we go again with 
; another whole year to get through.
