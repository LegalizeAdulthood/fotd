; FOTD -- January 19, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Since yesterday's FOTD I have continued to work with a variation 
; of the Tman formula that was posted on Friday.  Working with 
; this formula gives the impression that more than three dimen-
; sions are involved.  I can get no clear mental image of slicing 
; through a single 3-D object.  And if there is only one dimension 
; in addition to the two on the screen, why are the two variable 
; parameters needed to fully explore it?.  Morgan has also commen-
; ted on this, but for now, we'll assume that we're dealing with a 
; three-dimensional M-set (and a six-dimensional Julibrot?).
; 
; Today's image lies in the default fractal created by the TMan1 
; variation, near the point at the northern edge, where the two 
; straight stretched arms criss-cross.  I named the image "Maximum 
; Spirals".  I have rarely seen an image with so many spirals 
; surrounding a midget.
; 
; In the parent fractal, the scene is stretched, (foreshortened 
; actually), and skewed.  So in order to have a normal image I 
; needed to unstretch and unskew the scene.  When this was done, I 
; was left with an image that rates a 5.
; 
; I could rate the image no higher than a 5 because it duplicates 
; scenes that lie in spirals in many valleys of the classic M-set. 
; I don't expect to find any totally new Mandelbrot features in 
; this formula or its variations.  The interest lies in discover-
; ing which parts of the classic M-set are reflected in which 
; parts of the new-shaped Mandelbrot fractals.
; 
; I'll continue working with these fractals of ambiguous dimension 
; for a few days, then it will be back to the ever-fruitful M-Mix4 
; formula.
; 
; The render time of 9 minutes can be avoided by downloading the 
; GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather was sunny but very cold and breezy all day here at 
; Fractal Central.  The temperature in the teens F, around -9C, 
; kept the dynamic cats glued to the warmest spots they could 
; find.  They moved around enough to ask for food and eat, but 
; retired as soon as their meal was done.  It's cold again this 
; morning, with clouds and a few flakes of snow in the air.  But 
; it is not as cold as yesterday.  Only time will tell if the 
; snow will turn heavier and if the intrepid cats will venture 
; outdoors.
; 
; I find myself with nothing to do again today.  If I play my 
; cards right, I'll get through the entire day without doing 
; anything that can be considered work.  Until next FOTD, take 
; care, and one must work hard to be truly lazy.
