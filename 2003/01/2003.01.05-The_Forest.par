; FOTD -- January 05, 2003 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates a somewhat-below-average 4.  As is true with 
; all my ratings, this rating is totally subjective and exists 'in 
; my opinion'.  I found the midget easily enough, and decided that 
; its ghost would make a better image soon enough.  I determined 
; quickly enough that the <bof61> inside fill would do the best 
; job of revealing the ghost, and the final image rendered fast 
; enough.  At that point I was expecting an image worthy of a 
; rating of at least a 6.
; 
; But then I began coloring the image, and soon found that nothing 
; seemed to work.  I ended up with an image that I feel had a 
; rating of at least 6 in it, but which failed to live up to its 
; potential.  The disappointment might be due to my clumsy 
; attempts at coloring, or it might be due to an inherent diffi-
; culty in coloring such images.  Regardless, I could rate the 
; final result no higher than a humdrum 4.  I named the picture 
; "The Forest" because, with much imagination, one might see an 
; exotic forest in the image.
; 
; The formula behind the image combines portions of Z^(-1.4) and 
; Z^(-9.6), and adds (1/C) instead of plain C.  The parent 
; fractal, before it is evaporated, somewhat resembles a caterpil-
; lar.  Today's scene is located in a tiny valley on the southwest 
; shore of the largest circular bay.  As is the case with all 
; fractals of this double-negative class, (indeed with all frac-
; tals of any nature), other areas of the parent hold an infinity 
; of other scenes that will never be discovered.
; 
; The 9-minute render time can be avoided by downloading the com-
; pleted GIF image file from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Saturday was fractal-like here at F.C. -- some sun, 
; some clouds, some wind, and a temperature of 36F 2C.  Being frac-
; tal in nature, the cats checked the weather, ventured briefly 
; into the yard, then retired to their resting places to pass the 
; day.  As one can easily see, the lives of aging fractal cats are 
; not very exciting.
; 
; And this morning, light snow is falling.  The dynamic duo will 
; likely have another less-than-exciting day.  The nature of my 
; day is yet to be determined, as is the quality of tomorrow's 
; FOTD.  Check back then to see what happens.  Until next FOTD, 
; take care, and the FOTD-CD will be coming soon.
