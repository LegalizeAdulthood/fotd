; FOTD -- November 06, 2003 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Two days ago I posted a FOTD that illustrates what I assume to 
; be almost-Siegel Disks, or about as close as is possible to come 
; to Siegel Disks this side of infinity.  Then, yesterday, I began 
; wondering about the appearance of the Mandelbrot set at a point 
; so close to the Siegel-boundary.  The area was extremely easy to 
; find, but its maxiter of over 1-million made the rendering quite 
; slow.
; 
; What I found was an area of thin, wiry arms, so jagged that it 
; is difficult to determine the direction from which they are 
; coming.  The coloring shows that the arm in the upper right part 
; of the image is the lowest-iteration feature in the frame, but 
; the tan-colored arm in the left half of the frame could just as 
; easily be entering from the top as from the bottom.  It actually 
; enters from the top.
; 
; I also noticed that the midgets are very plentiful this deep in 
; the M-set.  At least 30 become visible in the frame when the 
; color mode is toggled.  I assume that the smaller ones are 
; surrounded by even wirier and more jagged arms in addition to 
; taking even longer to render.
; 
; Curiously, at this extreme location of the M-set, the normal 
; 2-4-8... pattern has all but vanished.  The pattern might be 
; there, but if it is, it is so distorted as to be virtually 
; beyond detection.
; 
; I am also curious about the appearance of the odd planes and 
; oblique slices of the Julibrot at this point, but without 
; Fractint's fast Mandelbrot formula to speed up the rendering, 
; such images would be extremely slow.  Still, I might investigate 
; this aspect in the near future, and if the results show anything 
; unusual, it will appear as a FOTD.
; 
; Like the Siegel Disk image of two days ago, the interest of 
; today's image lies mostly in the mathematical aspect, and like 
; the earlier image, it also rates a 4.  I named the image "Siegel 
; Mandelbrot" as a simple description.
; 
; With its render time of almost 1-1/2 hours, the image is a very 
; slow one, I recommend downloading it from one of the following 
; two web sites:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; But before going for the download, give Paul and Scott a chance 
; to render and post the image.
; 
; Snow fell all day Sunday here at Fractal Central, piling up 5in 
; 12cm by nightfall.  The snow, combined with a temperature of 30F 
; -1C, kept the dynamic fractal cats housebound.  They put on 
; their best pouts to let me know of their unhappiness, but 
; knowing them as I do, I realized that their displeasure was 
; mostly a show.
; 
; It's another threatening day today, with talk of several more 
; inches of snow by this evening.  (We still measure length in 
; inches, and temperature in degrees Fahrenheit here in the best 
; educated ;-) nation in the world.)  The cats were saddened by 
; the news of still more snow.  As for me, I've got enough 
; supplies stocked and enough graphic work waiting that I have no 
; time to be sad and no need to venture out on treacherous roads.
; 
; The next glorious fractal will appear in only 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and if you lift too much heavy snow, you might 
; hurt a Siegel Disk.
