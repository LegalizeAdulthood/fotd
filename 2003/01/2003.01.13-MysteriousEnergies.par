; FOTD -- January 13, 2003 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Unable to find a good opening for today's FOTD discussion, I 
; shall simply place my mind in idle and let my thoughts ramble 
; where they will.  Now let me see . . .
; 
; Every day for almost the entire life of the FOTD, I have opened 
; the discussion with the line 'Fractal visionaries and enthu-
; siasts'.  I do it without thought of the meaning, since the 
; line is part of my pre-formatted FOTD template file, and is 
; inserted into the text of the discussion automatically.  The 
; nature of the fractal enthusiast mentioned in the line is 
; obvious, but what is a fractal visionary?
; 
; My dictionary defines the word 'visionary' both as an adjective 
; meaning 'existing only in the mind', and as a noun meaning 
; 'a person who sees visions of hidden things'.  So a fractal 
; visionary is one who sees visions of the normally hidden things 
; known as fractals, (which BTW are only partly unreal).
; 
; Those who can see things, real or unreal, that others cannot see 
; are also known as mystics.  In times past, mystics were seen as 
; wise people; in our present age of reason run amok, they are 
; looked upon as a little weird, amusing but harmless -- that is 
; unless they start claiming and convincing too many others that 
; their visions are actual glimpses of other real worlds, in which 
; case they must be shown to be deluded.  In this age of reason, 
; there is and can be only one real world, the physical world,  
; with which we can be in touch.  There is no possibility of 
; interaction with other real worlds, which preferably do not 
; exist.  This status quo must be preserved at all costs.
; 
; Well, I often see things that others cannot see with eyes alone, 
; though I'm not sure if this makes me a mystic.  The things I see 
; are called fractals, and must be seen with the aid of a computer 
; and monitor.  With my real eyes, I can see fractals on my 
; computer screen whenever I wish, and I sometimes see them in my 
; dreams as real 3-D objects existing and evolving in 3-D space.  
; Since others can at least see my fractal visions on their own 
; computer screens, I guess this makes me a mystic of the second 
; order.  I could not be a mystic of the first order unless others 
; could also see the fractals I sometimes dream of in my dreams.
; 
; Today's image is a fractal of the third order.  It is mystical 
; in the sense that it cannot be seen without the aid of a 
; computer and also that it is another of my 'evaporated' images, 
; which consist entirely of the ghost of a fractal that once was 
; there.  (To see the fractal that once was there but has 
; vanished, change the imag(p3) parameter from 10^100 to zero.)
; 
; The parent of today's image consists of a multi-lobed string of 
; bays extending north to south.  A filament extends southwest 
; from the southernmost bud, and terminates in a zig-zagging ring. 
; Today's scene lies on this ring, not far from where the filament 
; joins it.  I named the image "Mysterious Energies" for no good 
; reason, and rated it a 7 because in my opinion it is above FOTD 
; average.
; 
; The render time of 9 minutes is a bit beyond the range of reason 
; for those with busy lives to lead.  But the already completed 
; GIF image is available for download on the internet at:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and at:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; The weather Sunday was sunny but cold here at Fractal Central, 
; with a high temperature of 29F -1.5C.  The cats endured their 
; indoor confinement with patience, blaming me only twice for the 
; chilly conditions beyond the door.
; 
; Today has so far been uneventful.  Hopefully, it will remain so, 
; as there is a bit more than the average amount of work to be 
; done.  Until next time, take care, and is it reasonable to 
; believe that fractals are real?
