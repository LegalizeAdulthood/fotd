; FOTD -- January 17, 2003 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Though it appears quite weird, today's image was not created 
; with the M-Mix4 formula.  It is actually part of the Z^1.93+C 
; fractal, which, when the multi-valued nature of the complex 
; logarithm is taken into account, is infinite in surface area.  
; In today's case, we have examined the fractal as it appears 57 
; levels down the log spiral.
; 
; In fractals like today's, the strangest and most interesting 
; things are found along the negative X-axis, where the major 
; split usually exists.  This is especially true in the parent of 
; today's image, where things that I would never expect are 
; happening along the X-axis split.
; 
; There is a fairly normal almost-quadratic midget at the center 
; of today's image, though it lies beyond the limit of resolution. 
; In fact the image itself is so close to the break-up point that 
; I included a mathtolerance=/1 entry in the parameter file to be 
; sure the image renders at the correct magnitude.
; 
; The image consists of a mixture of inside and outside material.  
; It was rendered with the inside set to < fmod >.  It is this 
; inside coloring that creates the effect of concentric rings.
; 
; I named the image "Four Eesses".  There are four almost-perfect 
; letter 'S's in the image.  I rated it at a 5.  It takes more 
; than a few embedded letters to make an above-average image.
; 
; The render time of 17 minutes can be avoided by downloading the 
; pre-rendered GIF image from:
; 
;           <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; or from:
; 
;           <http://sdboyd.dyndns.org/~sdboyd/fotd/index.html>
; 
; Now let's get to constructing that 4-dimensional 24-cell.  To 
; keep things simple, we'll start at the two-dimensional level.  
; It's best to have a glass-topped light table, straight edge, and 
; X-acto knife for this kind of dissection and construction.  I 
; did a lot of this kind of play stuff back in the slow times of 
; the good old days of the 70's and early 80's, when I worked at a 
; light table, cutting and pasting by hand.  But since light 
; tables are expensive and not everyone has one, the same thing 
; can be done with paper and scissors.
; 
; As I said in yesterday's FOTD, the 24-cell is the only regular 
; 4-dimensional polytope that has no analog in 3-space.  It does 
; however have a corresponding figure in 3-space that is similarly 
; constructed -- the rhombic dodecahedron.
; 
; To understand the construction of the rhombic dodecahedron we 
; can start in 2-space, with two equal paper squares.  Lay the two 
; squares side by side on the table top.  Then take one square and 
; cut it along its diagonals, resulting in four right triangles, 
; whose bases are the edges of the square and apexes the center.  
; Now take the four triangles and attach their bases to the four 
; edges of the other square.  The result is a larger square, 
; rotated 45 degrees, with twice the area and 1.4142 times the 
; width.  Not a very impressive construction, but it is a start.
; 
; The next step will be a three-dimensional one -- more difficult 
; to perform, but relatively simple to visualize.  Lay two equal 
; cubes on the table.  Take one cube and slice it into six square 
; pyramids, whose bases are the faces of the cube and apexes the 
; center.  Then take the six pyramids and attach their bases to 
; the six faces of the other cube.  The resulting polyhedron is a 
; rhombic dodecahedron.  It is not a regular figure because its 
; rhombic faces are not regular, and more importantly, because it 
; has two different kinds of vertices -- those where 3 edges meet 
; and those where 4 edges meet.
; 
; The final step -- the construction of the 24-cell -- cannot be 
; visualized, but the analogy is so clear that it can be followed. 
; To begin, we need an extra dimension.  Assuming we have found 
; the extra dimension, we can get started.  Lay two equal 4-D 
; hypercubes on the hypertable.  Take one hypercube and slice it 
; into eight cubical hyperpyramids, whose bases are the cells of 
; the hypercube and apexes the center.  Then take the eight hyper-
; pyramids and attach their bases to the eight cells of the other 
; hypercube.  The resulting figure is the 24-cell.  4-space is the 
; only space higher than 2 in which this construction produces a 
; regular figure.  In the higher spaces, there are too many lower-
; dimensional parts to the figure, which must be shaped and fit 
; together just right.
; 
; It appears I'm getting so involved in hyperspace that I almost 
; forgot about the Fractal Central weather.
; 
; The weather was cold again here at Fractal Central on Thursday, 
; with a temperature of 28F -2C and only a hazy sun.  The cats 
; chose comfort over adventure.  They decided to spend the day 
; indoors.  This morning is once again cold, and to make matters 
; worse, about 3cm of fresh snow fell overnight.  The cats, who 
; dislike cold wet paws, will not be happy about this.
; 
; I have a minor pile of work sitting on the shelf to my right, 
; but unlike the fractal duo, I can do more than be unhappy about 
; the situation.  So until the next FOTD appears almost by magic 
; in 24 hours, take care, and be moderately happy.
