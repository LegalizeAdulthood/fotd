; FOTD -- October 09, 2007 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; What happens when 2 parts of Z^(-0.5) are subtracted from 0.2 
; part of Z^2 and straight C is added?  The parent fractal of 
; today's image results.
; 
; More than anything else, this parent resembles a Mandelbrot set 
; that has been killed and flattened on the road.  I will not try 
; to describe the resulting mess, which bears only a vague simi-
; larity to the un-flattened M-set.  But I will comment that it 
; has a large 2-lobed bay filled with only the tiniest bits and 
; pieces of 'outside' stuff.  Today's scene is located in one of 
; the denser fields of this stuff.
; 
; The effect of broad radiating bands was achieved by rendering 
; the image with the 'inside' set to 'bof61'.  The only 'outside' 
; elements in the image are the four large warm-red ones surround-
; ing the invisible-but-really-there minibrot at the center, as 
; well as the scattered bits of salt and pepper.
; 
; The first name I chose for the image was 'Road-Kill Fractal".  
; But this name brings up too many unpleasant images, so I finally 
; chose the name "A Virtual Vacuum".  Since so much of the image, 
; which is not evaporated, consists of 'inside' stuff, the image 
; actually is rather empty, though perhaps not quite a true vacuum.
; 
; I kind of like the intense contrasts in the image.  The rating 
; of an 8.5 must therefore be considered totally justified.  The 
; calculation time of 49 seconds is thankfully brief.  Equally 
; convenient is a trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; to view the image there.
; 
; Midsummer weather in mid-October is hardly to be expected, but 
; when the temperature reached 91F 33C on Monday here at Fractal 
; Central, along with haze and high humidity, one might have sworn 
; it was mid-July.  The fractal cats never noticed the hot weather 
; as they hogged the cool air during the hottest part of the day.
; 
; I was too busy to complain about the afternoon heat, but when 
; evening came and the work was finished, I started to grumble.  
; Luckily, the unusually spectacular fractal of the day eased my 
; dis-satisfaction.  The next FOTD image will be ready, along with 
; its brief discussion, in about 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and when a question cannot possibly be answered, the question is 
; sometimes a meaningless one.
