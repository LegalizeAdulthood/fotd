; FOTD -- October 26, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With the number of video cameras, cell phone cameras, etc. now 
; in circulation, why has no one yet produced a clear photograph 
; of an alien space craft?  I want to believe, but I have nothing 
; to believe in, other than fractals, that is.  And I'm not even 
; sure I believe fractals are real.
; 
; For today's fractal adventure I mixed Z^(0.996) with Z^(-0.996), 
; added straight C and cut the escape radius to 90.  To me, the 
; resulting parent fractal resembles an alien flying saucer lying 
; on its side.  Some might see Bozo the Clown or maybe Popeye the 
; sailor, but whatever one sees, the whole fractal is on the verge 
; of evaporating, which is the reason for the name "The Vanishing 
; Point".  In fact, I had to reduce the bailout to 90 to keep the 
; part of the parent where today's image is located from slipping 
; into the imaginary fractal world.
; 
; My efforts were rewarded with an FOTD that rates a 6.  It could 
; have been better, but it also could have been worse, so I can't 
; complain.
; 
; Today's image is located on the north shore of the parent 
; fractal, at the point where the bud-filled chaotic shore ends 
; and the smooth shoreline begins.  I added extra interest by 
; rendering the scene with the inside set to 'fmod' and the 
; outside set to 'summ'.  
; 
; The calculation time of 8 minutes is slightly slow, but still 
; well within reason for an image that has never before been seen 
; and never again will be seen.  And an even faster way to see the 
; image is to go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the image in finished form there.
; 
; The Thursday weather proved un-notable here at Fractal Central 
; of central Pennsylvania.  The high temperature of 61F 16C was 
; fair enough, the partly cloudy skies were fair enough, and the 
; mild wind from the east was fair enough.  The fractal cats 
; agreed as they kept a sharp eye on the pigeons roosting under 
; the eaves of the house next door.
; 
; I had a rather busy day working on a menu for a local restaurant.
; But the work went smoothly and the task was completed with ample 
; time remaining for the day's fractal.  The next fractal will be 
; posted in 24 hours, more or less.  Until then, take care, and it 
; would be great if aliens from other worlds actually were flying 
; around the earth in their alien space craft.  Maybe they could 
; teach us a thing or two about fractals.
