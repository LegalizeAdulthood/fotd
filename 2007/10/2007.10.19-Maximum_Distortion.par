; ---------
; FOTD -- October 20, 2007 (Rating 7.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal is another rather slow one.  It lies deep 
; in the East Valley of the parent fractal that results when 
; Z^(-1.01) is subtracted from Z^(1.01) and (1/C) is added.
; 
; Without a doubt, this parent fractal is the most distorted 
; Mandeloid I have yet come upon.  At first glance, it doesn't 
; even look like a Mandeloid.  It looks more like an oversized 
; squashed and folded circle with rough edges.  But a second look 
; reveals that those rough edges are actually bud radicals, and 
; the fold is the barely recognizable East Valley.
; 
; Despite its appearance, today's image was rendered in the fully 
; traditional manner, with the inside a solid black and the 
; outside colored according to the iteration count.  The sinuous 
; iteration bands are in the fractal, though I did emphasize them 
; a bit with the coloring.
; 
; To reward myself for the coloring, I rated the image a 7-1/2.  
; The name "Maximum Distortion" refers to the parent fractal.  The 
; maxiter of 750,000 is larger than it need be, but with the 
; logmap feature turned off, it makes little difference.
; 
; The calculation time of 16-3/4 minutes is admittedly slow.  To 
; avoid delay, I suggest going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; With a temperature of 75F 24C, it remained unusually warm here 
; at Fractal Central on Friday, though an all-day string of sudden 
; showers kept the day from being too pleasant.  The fractal cats 
; showed their displeasure by viciously attacking their scratching 
; posts.
; 
; My day was average, which means nothing happened worth telling 
; about.  The next FOTD is due in 24 hours.  Check then for near 
; total fractal satisfaction.  Until next time, take care, and 
; after thousands of years, one would expect people to realize 
; that ghosts are all in the mind.  But then again, neuro-biolo-
; gists claim the mind is all in the brain, while at the same time 
; philosophers claim that all we can know about the brain comes 
; from images in the mind.  Do I see circular reasoning at work?
