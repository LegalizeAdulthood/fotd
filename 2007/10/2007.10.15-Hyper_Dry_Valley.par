; FOTD -- October 16, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's curious image is another venture into the fractal that 
; results when 0.2 parts of Z^3 are subtracted from Z^2 before C 
; is added.  This fractal appears as a Mandelbrot set rotated 180 
; degrees, with an extra spike extending from its East Valley, 
; which of course is on its west side.
; 
; But today we ignore this extra spike and check the more conven-
; tional spike extending eastward from the Mandeloid's nose.  
; There is a very prominent minibrot on this spike, which appears 
; to be two partially merged minibrots.  Today's image is located 
; rather deep in the northern branch of what at first appears to 
; be a Seahorse-type valley, but actually is an entirely new type 
; of valley.
; 
; I named the image "Hyper-Dry Valley" because despite the promis-
; ing appearance of the chaotic yet symmetrical 'object', I could 
; find no minibrot at the center.  The minibrot might be there, 
; but the resolution failed before I reached it.
; 
; Despite the disappointment, I rated the image at a 6.  The 
; fractal object, if indeed it *is* an object, has such a real 
; appearance that I could do no less.  I'll leave it to the philo-
; sophers to argue the actual reality of fractal objects such as 
; the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; But one thing that cannot to be argued is the calculation time 
; of the image, which is a rather slow 10-3/4 minutes on the 
; fractal fireball, and just over one hour on the fractal snowball.
; 
; The finished image has been sent ahead to Paul at the FOTD web 
; site, and by the time you read this, it should be already posted 
; and ready for instant viewing.

; 
; Very fine weather prevailed here at Fractal Central on Monday, 
; with sunny skies and a temperature of 68F 20C.  The fractal cats 
; enjoyed the sun from their shelf in the window.  My day was as 
; average as the fractal.  I expect another average day tomorrow, 
; but hopefully the fractal will be better.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and everyone has 
; some degree of faith in something.
