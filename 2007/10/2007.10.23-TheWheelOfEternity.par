; FOTD -- October 23, 2007 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "The Wheel of Eternity".  I was in a kind 
; of mystical mood when I searched for a name, and this is what I 
; came up with.  And why not get mystical with fractals?  After 
; all, almost anything seems to be considered true by someone some-
; where in today's world, where those who have actually experi-
; enced the preternatural know that it does exist, and skeptics, 
; who are solidly grounded in physical reality, know that it does 
; not.  Since I have yet to decide whether fractals are real, un-
; real, or somewhere in between, I have no comment at this time 
; on the preternatural.  (I might have a comment in the not-too-
; distant future however.)
; 
; One thing in-between is today's image.  Though it is worth 
; about a 6, I actually rated it at a 6.5.  The extra half-point 
; is to reward myself for the minimum of extra effort I put into 
; the coloring.
; 
; I am sometimes asked why I post so many images of Minibrots.  
; The answer is that this is the infinitesimal part of the 
; infinite world of fractals that I have chosen to concentrate 
; on, and learn as much as possible about.  When working with 
; fractals, one can know either a little about a lot or a lot 
; about a little.  I have made the latter choice.
; 
; The parent fractal was created when I subtracted Z^(1.1) from 10 
; parts of Z^(-1.1) and then added C, while increasing the escape 
; radius to 625.  This parent fractal lies totally off the default 
; screen, making a couple outzooms necessary before it comes into 
; view.  It consists of a distorted Mandeloid, shaped somewhat 
; like a dumbbell, with a period-2 bud larger than its main bay, 
; and a smaller, half-obscured Mandeloid some distance southwest.  
; Today's scene is located in what appears to be a kind of East 
; Valley of this smaller Mandeloid.
; 
; With its calculation time of 1-1/4 minutes, today's image is 
; blessedly fast.  But the minor chore of setting up and running 
; the included parameter file is still there.  This minor task may 
; be avoided however by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the completed image there.
; 
; With partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 73F 23C, Monday 
; was rather pleasant here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats 
; must have agreed, for they spent a good part of the day sleeping.
; 
; My day was average busy.  If all goes well, tomorrow will be a 
; repeat.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and beware.
