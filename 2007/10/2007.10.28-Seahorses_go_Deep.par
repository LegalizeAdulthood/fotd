; FOTD -- October 28, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I found today's scene in the Mandelbrot set almost 
; automatically.  It lies in the Seahorse Valley area of a larger 
; minibrot located near the tip of the long filament extending 
; from the large period-3 north bud of the large minibrot on the 
; main spike of the M-set.
; 
; With that much said, I must tell that I named the image 
; "Seahorses go Deep".  I did this in recognition of its location 
; deep in the Seahorse Valley of a larger minibrot.
; 
; When all the naming was said and done, I rated the day's fractal 
; work at a 7.  It's really not such a bad image, perhaps a bit 
; too busy for perfection, but considering that its magnitude is 
; well into the range of arbitrary precision math, its calculation 
; time of 8-1/2 minutes is really quite reasonable.
; 
; But 8-1/2 minutes is still 8-1/2 minutes.  Luckily, relief for 
; possible fractal impatience is at hand.  The finished image is 
; or soon will be posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Actually, the only thing seahorsey about the image is its name.  
; At this extreme magnitude, all minibrots begin to look the same, 
; with circular rings after rings surrounding the midgets and 
; obscuring most of the other detail.  But the circular nature of 
; the features in today's image can easily be escaped.  Outzooming 
; to the surface of the M-set will reveal some quite attractive 
; and non-circular patterns on the way.
; 
; Saturday began with rain here at Fractal Central, but by noon 
; the clouds moved out, leading to a mostly sunny afternoon with a 
; temperature of 66F 19C.  The fractal cats, Nicholas and 
; Cassandra, (Nico and Cassie), enjoyed the returning sunshine to 
; the utmost.  Fractal Lady and I took the afternoon off for a 
; short trip to a nearby forest, which had been refreshed by the 
; rain.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  It might even 
; be a great one, but there is no guarantee.  It could just as 
; easily be a loser.  Until then, take care, and as Halloween 
; approaches, don't be spooked by a specter.
