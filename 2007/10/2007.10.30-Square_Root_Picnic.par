; FOTD -- October 30, 2007 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us once again to one of the infinity of 
; fractals created by the formula Z^sqrt(2)+C, this time to the 
; fractal that appears 1.4142 levels up the logarithmic ladder, a 
; fractal that resembles a limbless torso with a head attached 
; -- a perfect parent fractal for the day before Halloween.  The 
; scene is located in the chaos on the eastern side of the head.
; 
; The image shows a small minibrot and its surrounding pattern.  
; As must always be the case in fractals where the power of Z is 
; fractional, the features in the image are broken and scrambled.  
; But the broken features make a rough kind of symmetrical pattern 
; around the midget, which is barely striking enough to raise the 
; image to FOTD status.  I can give no logical reason for the name 
; "Square-Root Picnic".
; 
; Since I have done so many of these scrambled fractals with 
; exponents of Z between 1 and 2, and achieved only a modicum of 
; success, I could not give the image an honest rating, but it is 
; still worth a look.  The calculation time of 7 minutes is 
; slightly slow for such a less-than-splendid image.  To save time 
; and frustration, I recommend going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; After a foggy and frosty start, Monday turned quite pleasant 
; here at Fractal Central, with sunny skies, light winds, and a 
; high temperature of 55F 18C.  The fractal cats were more con-
; cerned with something in the hallway than with the weather.  
; They must still remember the mouse that popped out of the hole 
; in the floor by the radiator last year around this time.  When 
; no mouse appeared on Monday, I comforted the disappointed duo 
; with a treat of tuna and cheddar cheese.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and don't get caught up in a non-local fractal field pattern.
