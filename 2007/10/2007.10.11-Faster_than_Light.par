; FOTD -- October 11, 2007 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; How could I give a fair rating to just another fractal image in 
; the Mandelbrot set?  I couldn't.  So I let today's image go 
; un-rated.  But it's really a rather attractive scene from the 
; eastern environs of the large minibrot on the negative spike.  
; And with its virtually non-existent calculation time of 1-1/2 
; seconds, it is well worth a glance.  In fact, on my fast machine 
; it finishes before the video mode switches.
; 
; This exceptional calculation speed inspired the name "Faster 
; than Light".  Of course, it's impossible for any information-
; bearing signal to reach a velocity greater than the universal 
; speed limit of light, but fractals are strange things, and I 
; wonder if this limit applies to them.
; 
; Interesting things might result if it were possible for fractals 
; to exceed the velocity of light.  For example, they might go 
; backward in time, and we could see a finished image today that 
; we would not discover until tomorrow.
; 
; Could fractals possibly go faster than light?  Well, fractals 
; are made of numbers, and numbers are human thought processes 
; expressed in symbolic form.  We don't know exactly what thought 
; is, but one thing is certain.  Thought is not limited by the 
; speed of light.  We can imagine ourselves standing on Mars and 
; mentally be there instantly.  So maybe fractals in some way 
; actually can move faster than light.  But if they can, it is a 
; total mystery what this ability means to us.
; 
; With its calculation time of 1-1/2 seconds, today's image is one 
; of the rare ones that calculate in less time than it takes to 
; view the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; But viewing the image on the web site still saves the hassle of 
; setting up and running the included parameter file.
; 
; The weather on Wednesday was much more seasonal here at Fractal 
; Central.  The high temperature of 75F 24C was still warmer than 
; it should be in mid-October, but far more reasonable than the 
; 91F 33C of the past few days.  The indoor fractal cats were more 
; interested in watching the outdoor squirrels gather nuts than in 
; the cooler weather.
; 
; In my department, the commercial work was wrapped up early, 
; leaving a rather relaxing day.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and if you take enough care, good 
; things of a fractal nature will eventually come your way.
