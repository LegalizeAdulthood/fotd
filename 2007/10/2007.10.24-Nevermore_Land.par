; FOTD -- October 24, 2007 (Rating 5.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image, which was created by 
; combining Z with Z^(-0.5) and adding C, resembles a fractal 
; bullet.  Today's scene is located on the north shore of the 
; bullet, where some very tiny mandel-buds are located.
; 
; I named the image "Nevermore Land" because after finding what 
; lies there, it is unlikely that I'll ever go there again.  I 
; could rate the image itself at only a 5.  My semi-expert color-
; ing efforts added the extra half-point.
; 
; Today's fractal image shows an abstract land of fractals -- a 
; land created by numbers and populated by the horde of similar 
; figures that fill the frame.  Not surprisingly, as we dive 
; deeper into the image, these figures are repeated at ever 
; smaller sizes without end, all the way to infinitesimal infin-
; ity.  That's the way fractals are.
; 
; An overwhelmingly prominent, blazing white minibrot sits at the 
; center of today's scene, looking strangely out of place, almost 
; as though it were dropped there by some higher power.  It has 
; little symmetry to betray its existence, and almost no basin of 
; attraction around it.  Other smaller minibrots are scattered 
; throughout the scene, all of them similar to the one in today's 
; image.
; 
; The parameter file at the end of this discussion takes just over 
; 5 minutes to complete on the fireball P4-2000mhz machine.  On 
; the droopy old P-200mhz snowball unit it takes about 1/2 hour.  
; On the FOTD web site the image has already been calculated and 
; posted for maximum enjoyment.  The web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy clouds and occasional rain spoiled the day Tuesday here at 
; Fractal Central.  The temperature of 72F 22C, however, was quite 
; pleasant.  The fractal cats, who dislike rain, spent the day 
; watching the humans do their work.
; 
; My work was finished earlier than expected, which gave me a 
; chance to find today's parent fractal.  The next fractal will be 
; posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and numbers describe 
; the universe so well because we created them intentionally to do 
; just that.
