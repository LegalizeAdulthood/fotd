; FOTD -- May 07, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's bright, lacy image lies in the parent fractal that 
; appears when the formula Z^sqrt(2)+C is iterated 52 levels up 
; the topless and bottomless complex logarithmic ladder.  This 
; parent reminds me of a distorted Mandelbrot set with its west 
; side facing southeast.
; 
; Despite its odd shape, the open area at the center is a true 
; midget, though there is certainly very little of a quadratic 
; nature about it. 
; 
; Today's image is located in the northeast branch of what might 
; be called Seahorse Valley, since it cuts off a very prominent 
; period-2 bud.  When I saw the image I rated at a 7 almost 
; immediately.  I have no logical explanation to offer for the 
; name I gave the image -- "Iteration Quest".  It sounds kind of 
; interesting though, and might attract a few viewers.
; 
; And speaking of attracting viewers, when I checked the FOTD web 
; site today, I couldn't help but notice all the nameless images I 
; have been posting for the past several months.  Without names, 
; these images are not going to attract many viewers.  So from now 
; on, regardless of how much or how little effort I put into the 
; FOTD fractals, I will give every one both a name and a rating.
; 
; Today's image takes over 41 minutes to calculate on my P200 
; machine.  (There is no more P133 machine; it gave up the 
; iteration last Thursday.)  The 41-minute wait may be avoided by 
; visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the completed image there.
; 
; Lots of sun and an only slightly cooler temperature of 66F 19C 
; made Sunday a day to remember here at Fractal Central.  The 
; fractal cats may not remember the weather, but they will 
; remember the dove that landed right outside their window.
; 
; My day was unusually pleasant.  Too bad every day can't be the 
; same.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and don't dare turn a Klein bottle inside-out.
