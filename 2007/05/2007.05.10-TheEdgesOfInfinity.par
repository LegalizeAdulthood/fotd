; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When we see an escape radius of one googol in a fractal with 
; only negative powers of Z, we know that the image shows an 
; 'evaporated' fractal.  Today's image has an escape radius of one 
; googol and the powers of Z are -1.5 and -5.5.  Therefore, the 
; image is 'evaporated'.
; 
; Evaporated fractals consist of only 'inside' stuff.  All points 
; are trapped.  When rendered in the normal equal-iteration-band 
; manner, an 'evaporated' fractal will not be a fractal at all.  
; It will be a blank screen.  But apply an active 'inside' fill to 
; that blank screen and watch what happens.
; 
; I rendered today's image with the inside set to 'bof61', which 
; colors the points according to the number of the iteration that 
; takes the points closest to the origin.  The result is an image 
; that rates a 6.
; 
; The parent fractal consists of 4 bays, many fractal rings, and a 
; prominent 'fan'.  Today's scene is located in the interior of 
; the fan.  After a bit of meditation, I named the image "The 
; Edges of Infinity".  And why not?  It's hardly possible to get 
; closer to infinity than the googol that the points in today's 
; fractal are allowed to wander.  (Yes, I realize that 10^100 is 
; no closer to infinity than just plain 10.)
; 
; The render time of 2 minutes is true on the new fractal-
; dedicated computer -- a 2000mhz P4 unit.  On the old P1-200mhz 
; the image would have taken around 12 minutes, which is still 
; within reason.  Even more reasonable is the FOTD web site, where 
; the completed image is posted for easy viewing.  The web site 
; may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Another perfect day passed unappreciated by the fractal cats 
; here at Fractal Central on Wednesday.  They were totally uncon-
; cerned with the sunny skies, light winds and high temperature of 
; 84F 29C.  They did concern themselves with their evening treats 
; however.
; 
; My day was unexpectedly busy, but the job was a small one and 
; was finished by the middle of the afternoon.  Tomorrow will 
; likely be the same.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and the light is right.
