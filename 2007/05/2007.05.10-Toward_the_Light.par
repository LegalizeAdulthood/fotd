; FOTD -- May 11, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image reminds me of a NDE or near-death experience.  I 
; named it "Toward the Light".  All the standard NDE stuff is 
; there, including the narrow doorway at the end of the brightly-
; lit tunnel and the celestial clouds, filled with nebulae of 
; stars.  I leave it to the viewer to decide whether paradise lies 
; beyond that distant doorway at the end of the tunnel, or the 
; whole thing is an illusion of an oxygen-starved brain.
; 
; One thing for certain is that today's image rates a 6.  I 
; briefly considered rating it at a 7, but on second thought 
; decided on a 6.  The tunnel effect is not quite strong enough 
; to earn a rating of 7.
; 
; Actually, the little midget near the center is an exact copy of 
; its parent fractal, which is a large northwest-southeast- 
; oriented, flat oval-shaped bay with a field of fractal chaos 
; extending some distance to the northwest.  But today's image is 
; located off to the side, in some suburban debris on the north-
; east side of the large oval main bay.
; 
; The calculation time of 55 seconds is true on the P4-2000 unit, 
; but even on the P200 the time would be no more than 5 minutes.  
; The P4-2000 has 10 times the clock speed of the old P200, but 
; calculates fractals only 5 times as fast.
; 
; All this confusion about time may be avoided by visiting the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the image there.
; 
; Thursday started fair enough here at Fractal Central, with lots 
; of sun and a temperature in the 70's F, low 20's C, but clouds 
; moved in just after noon, and a thunder-shower arrived at 4pm.  
; All of this went un-noticed by the fractal cats, who spent most 
; of the day sleeping like they were already over 15 years old.
; 
; My day was notably average.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and search for those elusive 
; alternate universes.
