; FOTD -- May 26, 2007 (Rating ?)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Try as I may, I could not decide how to rate today's image, 
; which is a scene in the Hyper-Mandelbrot set.  I also am 
; confused as to exactly what this formula does.  Sometimes I 
; suspect that it draws two overlapping Mandelbrot sets, but then 
; it comes up with something that does not exist in the familiar 
; Mandelbrot set.
; 
; For example, consider the parent fractal of today's image.  It 
; is obviously closely related to the Mandelbrot set, but it could 
; never be a result of two overlapping M-sets.  To start, it has 
; two East Valleys.  This could be a result of two identical but 
; slightly separated M-sets, but it has two quadratic midgets 
; where the large period-3 north and south buds should be, and its 
; Seahorse Valley is something entirely new.
; 
; I named today's image "Eruptive Iterations", since it could be 
; taken as an erupting volcano without too much difficulty.  But 
; the most notable feature of the image is its fantastic array of 
; spider-like filaments.  It does indeed remind me of the images 
; produced by the type=spider formula.
; 
; The calculation time of 14 minutes on a P2000 machine is a bit 
; slow.  But relief for slowness may easily be obtained on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the finished image is posted, ready for viewing.
; 
; The weather here at Fractal Central got a bit too perfect on 
; Friday, when the humidity moved in and the temperature reached 
; 88F 31C.  But heat doesn't worry cats too much, so the fractal 
; cats had a pleasant day despite the heat.  And a cooling 
; thunder-shower arrived as night fell.
; 
; My day was rather busy, and tomorrow will likely be the same.  
; I'll try to post the FOTD on schedule, but there is no 
; guarantee.  Until next time, take care, and the more we discover 
; in these fractals, the less we know.
