; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's evaporated image lies in the fractal that results when 3 
; negative parts of Z^(-1.5) are combined with 0.5 negative part 
; of Z^(-5.5) and (1/C) is added.  This fractal consists of a 
; north-south chain of 3 bays, surrounded by much interesting semi-
; chaos.  Today's scene is found in a small area of this semi-
; chaos at the northern end of the chain of bays.
; 
; I named the image "Green Enough" when I was impressed by the 
; greenish spider arms that appear to be swirling about the 
; central midget.  This midget is partly camouflaged by the 
; 'bof61' inside fill that was necessary to bring the entire 
; evaporated scene to life.
; 
; I thought for a few minutes before I rated the image at a 
; perfectly average 5.  I would have rated it higher, but I could 
; find nothing in it that really is above present-day fractal 
; average.
; 
; The one-minute render time on the P2000 would be extended to 
; five minutes on the P200.  Both times are well within reason.  
; The most reasonable way to see the image however is to visit the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view it there.
; 
; A warm and somewhat muggy day here at Fractal Central on Sunday 
; was ideal for outdoor activity of all kinds.  There was a slight 
; scare in the afternoon when a thunder-shower passed close enough 
; to the south to produce a cooling gust of wind, but the rain 
; stayed well away.  The fractal cats had their activity indoors, 
; so the 86F 30C weather did not concern them.
; 
; My day was busier than I would have liked, but not so busy that 
; I had no time for fractals.  The next fractal will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care and when you search for the answer 
; to the universe, be sure you know the question.
