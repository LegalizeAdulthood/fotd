; FOTD -- May 24, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's parameter file has no formula included.  It needs none, 
; since it was created with the built-in manzpower formula of 
; Fractint.  The image features a mis-shapen midget that lies in 
; one of the seven-tenths-there elephants that line the southern 
; shoreline of East Valley of the parent fractal.
; 
; Since the East Valley elephants are only seven-tenths there, we 
; know that the formula that created the image is Z^(1.7)+C.  I 
; could have found the same image just as easily with any number 
; of formulas in my basic 'allinone' formula file, but I wanted to 
; keep the process as simple as possible.  I dislike complexity, 
; except in fractal images, of course.
; 
; I named the image "Little Snub-Nose".  That's what I thought of 
; when I saw the midget trying so hard but not quite making it to 
; quadratic status.  The rating of a 7 reflects my sympathy for 
; the little fellow.  The calculation time of 2-3/4 minutes is 
; true on the 2000mhz machine.  The 200mhz unit would take around 
; 10 minutes to finish.
; 
; Yes, I know that the high-speed machine is only 4 times as fast 
; with today's fractal as the old machine that runs at only 1/10 
; the speed, but apparently a Pentium-4 is not as efficient with 
; 16-bit applications as a 10-year-old first generation Pentium.
; 
; Strangely enough, the new 2000mhz unit is 20 times as fast as 
; the old 200mhz machine when calculating Fractint's built-in 
; Mandelbrot and Julia formulas, which I suspect are programmed 
; to use machine language.
; 
; Technical issues aside, the quickest way to view today's image 
; is to visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image is posted for full and immediate enjoyment.
; 
; A beautiful day here at Fractal Central was not appreciated by 
; the fractal cats, who spent most of yet another day in the din-
; ing room window, watching the squirrels go about their business 
; in the yard.  The sunny skies, light winds and temperature of 
; 82F 28C hold too little interest for young cats as active as 
; cats can be (which, to be honest, is not very active).
; 
; My day was moderately busy.  Tomorrow will probably be the same. 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and do fractals have the equivalent of genes and DNA?
