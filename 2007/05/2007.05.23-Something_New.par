; FOTD -- May 23, 2007 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The four-dimensional HyperMandelbrot set is virtually ignored.  
; And why not?  Very little totally new stuff is to be found in 
; it.  But is it actually as devoid of new stuff as would first 
; appear?  Today's image answers that question with a resounding 
; NO!
; 
; Today's under-used formula draws the 4-D HyperMandelbrot set, 
; and does some strange things with it.  I do not fully understand 
; all the things this formula does, but one thing is certain.  It 
; plays some very interesting tricks with the familiar elements of 
; the classic Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The familiar M-set has been quite well explored, at least down 
; to the level where the slow arbitrary-precision math kicks in, 
; and most of the features to be found in its upper depths have 
; been well investigated.  It would be curious indeed if something 
; truly new were to be uncovered in this range.
; 
; Well, today's image uncovers something totally new.  As far as I 
; know, nothing like it has ever been found in the familiar two-
; dimensional M-set.  Today we are investigating the four-dimen-
; sional Hyper-M-set however, so it is no wonder new things are 
; popping up.
; 
; I named today's image "Something New" because that's what it is. 
; I rated it at an exceptional 8 because it truly is something 
; new.  The calculation time of 55 seconds is on the P4-2000.  On 
; the P200 it would take about 3 minutes to finish.
; 
; But why not forget inconveniences like calculating parameter 
; files?  View the finished image on the FOTD web site at:

; 
; With full sun and a temperature of 75F 24C, Tuesday was not 
; quite perfect here at Fractal Central; the sky was slightly 
; hazy.  But despite the lack of a pure blue sky, the day came so 
; close to having perfect weather that only a professional weather 
; observer would notice the deficiency.
; 
; The fractal cats most certainly never noticed the gray haze.  
; They were far too busy watching four squirrels that were running 
; around in the yard all afternoon.
; 
; My day was average.  Only the above-average fractal saved it 
; from being a dull day.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and reasoning about fractals could be 
; unreasonable.
