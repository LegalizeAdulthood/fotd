; FOTD -- May 29, 2007 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There is a curious rectangle in the Julia set of the formula 
; Z^(2.003)+C with initial C set to -1.7453,0.  Its Z coordinates 
; are 0.00019,0.07388.  It is best seen at a magnitude around 100. 
; I have featured this Julia rectangle and various distortions of 
; it many times over the 10-year life of the FOTD.
; 
; Not surprisingly, similar rectangles surround the Mandelbrot 
; midgets in the -1.7453,0 area of the Z^(2.003)+C Mandelbrot set. 
; But there are an infinity of other directions in which the 
; 4-dimensional Julibrot can be sliced at this point.  Does the 
; rectangle exist in any of these odd slices?  As today's image 
; shows, it most certainly does exist in at least some of the odd 
; slices.  Today's scene is sliced very near the Oblate direction, 
; and the rectangle, if anything, is even more spectacular.
; 
; The appearance of origin symmetry in the image is deceiving.  A 
; close examination reveals subtle differences at the corners.  
; But if the slice had been exactly in the Oblate direction, the 
; symmetry would have been preserved.
; 
; I rated the image at a 5, since there are only so many times the 
; same fractal object can be shown and rated above average.  I 
; named the image "Once A Rectangle--", because no matter how the 
; orientation is twisted, the rectangle is always hiding somewhere 
; nearby.
; 
; The calculation time of under 3 minutes on the P2000 would be 
; around 12 minutes on the P200 unit.  But why calculate when the 
; finished image is posted for viewing on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Near perfect weather prevailed here at Fractal Central on 
; Monday.  Only a slight bit too much humidity kept it from being 
; absolutely perfect.  Of course, weather perfection is a 
; subjective thing.  With almost no rain for the past month, the 
; local farmers certainly are not calling the weather perfect.
; 
; The fractal cats spent the day being cats.  I spent the day 
; trying but not quite succeeding avoiding activity.  The next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, endure.
