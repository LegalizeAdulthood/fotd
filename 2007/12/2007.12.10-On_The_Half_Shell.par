; FOTD -- December 11, 2007 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "On the Half-Shell".  At one time, some-
; thing about it must have reminded me of a shell, but all I can 
; see in it at this time is a variety of fractal stuff, which is 
; just adequate for being the FOTD for today.  And no, there is no 
; picture of the Goddess Venus hidden in the depths.
; 
; The image lies in the parent fractal that has been the source of 
; every image so far in December.  It is located at the junction 
; of a very large ring in the western extremities of its parent.  
; and when I say extremities, I mean extremities.  The X-coordi-
; nate of the image is greater than negative 203.
; 
; The rating of a 6.5 is rather above average.  It could have been 
; higher, but somehow, the images of December are starting to look 
; too similar, and the similarity knocked a point or two off the 
; rating.  I gave myself the usual half-point bonus for a coloring 
; job that makes more of the fractal than it has in it.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/3 minutes might or might not be rea-
; sonable, depending on the definition of the word 'reason' when 
; applied to fractals.  But why worry with definitions when the 
; completed image may be viewed almost immediately by surfing to 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and enjoying the fractal glories there.
; 
; The very unpleasant weather of Sunday continued on Monday here 
; at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats spent the day ignoring the 
; weather and watching for the squirrels that never appeared.  My 
; day was about average.  The next FOTD image will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and be skeptical of skeptics who 
; don't believe in fractals.
