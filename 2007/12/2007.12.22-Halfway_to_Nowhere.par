; FOTD -- December 22, 2007 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today and tomorrow we take a brief break from scenes in the 
; December parent fractal to dive quite deep into the Mandelbrot 
; set for a view of one of the most unusual scenes I have yet 
; discovered there.  The location is on the northeast shore line 
; of the large period-2 bud of the M-set, at a location near the 
; border of Seahorse Valley where the Seahorse Valley character-
; istics are just starting to take shape.
; 
; By the way, don't exert to much effort diving down to see the 
; minibrot at the center.  It's a long slow trip, and I am almost 
; there myself.  Tomorrow's FOTD will be a picture of that tiny 
; atom.
; 
; I named today's image "Halfway to Nowhere" because the scene 
; lies about halfway to the unseen minibrot at the center.  But 
; even though we are only halfway to the goal in today's image, 
; the magnitude of over 8.4(10^47) is not to be sneezed at, or 
; coughed at either.
; 
; The rating of 8-1/2 has nothing to do with an old Fellini movie. 
; It indicates that, in my opinion, not only is the image much 
; above average, but my coloring is worth another half point as 
; well.
; 
; The down-side is the calculation time, which, due to the extreme 
; magnitude, is a dragged-out 22 minutes on the fast machine and 
; over 1-1/2 hours on the slow one.  Slow images like this make 
; a fractalist appreciate the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image will soon be posted for viewing without the 
; hassle of calculation.  And to speed things up I have sent the 
; finished image on ahead to Paul to save him the time it would 
; take to run the parameter file.  Of course, those who enjoy long 
; calculations may always run the parameter file themselves.  It 
; works quite well.
; 
; Friday here at Fractal central started cloudy, turned sunny by 
; 11am, clouded up at 2pm and cleared at 5pm, while the tempera-
; ture reached 43F 6C.  Since this was the shortest day of the 
; year, I think we did pretty good.  The fractal cats must have 
; agreed, for they passed the day watching squirrels.
; 
; My day was on the busy side, but still well under control.  The 
; next FOTD fractal, a close-up of the invisible minibrot at the 
; center of today's image, will be posted in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and how deep can you go?  Check back tomorrow 
; for a demonstration
