; FOTD -- December 14, 2007 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Well, here it is in all its glory -- the parent fractal for the 
; month of December -- the universe we have been exploring all 
; this month.  And what a world it is.  To begin, its size is 
; deceptive.  The magnitude of an unusually small 0.0068 makes its 
; area 10000 times the area covered by the Mandelbrot set.  The 
; center point of the image, -128,-30, is no mistake.  We actually 
; are this far from the origin.
; 
; Studying the image, we notice that it is filled with rings, as 
; have been most of the images so far this month.  Every filament 
; terminates in a decorative ring.  Then we notice the main bay, 
; if that's what it is.  This nearly circular feature bears little 
; resemblance to the cardioid shape of the classic Mandelbrot main 
; bay.  Where is East Valley, and where is Seahorse Valley?  
; Actually, these features are in the fractal, though well hidden.
; 
; We next notice the largest bud on this circular bay.  Intuition 
; says that it is the main bud, and would therefore have a periodi-
; city of 2.  But actually, its periodicity is 13, as can easily 
; be checked by counting the number of arms in its star.  If there 
; is a main bay in this parent fractal, it is very distorted.  And 
; look at the shape of the chaotic area leading from the large bud 
; to the largest ring.  It does rather resemble an East Valley 
; elephant.
; 
; The elephant resemblance is even more pronounced in the chaotic 
; area of the slightly smaller bud north of the large one, which 
; strangely enough has a periodicity of 12.  It appears that 
; nearly the entire shore line of the circular bay is the southern 
; shore of the main bay of this fractal, and the farther we travel 
; counter-clockwise, the deeper go into an East Valley environment.
; 
; It is now simple to find the actual period-2 bud and Seahorse 
; Valley.  Simply count clockwise around the buds from the 
; period-13 bud until the count reaches 2.  There is our main bud, 
; complete with Seahorse Valley and the main spike, all of them so 
; small that a blow up is needed to make them visible at all.  As 
; we continue beyond the period-2 bud, the periodicity rapidly 
; increases until we find ourselves deep in the north side of East 
; Valley.
; 
; This area of the fractal is actually the most interesting.  The 
; smaller circular bay just to the east is something entirely new. 
; Nothing like it appears anywhere in the M-set.  It is highly 
; fragmented, and at first appears to be non-critical.  But its 
; shore is dotted with tiny irregular buds in which some very 
; curious minibrots are well hidden.
; 
; The fractal is also peculiar in that the orbits of the points 
; diverge so fast as to be virtually invisible.  Occasionally a 
; single dot appears, but this is a rarity.  Such rapidly 
; diverging orbits are likely true of all fractals created with 
; negative exponents of Z.
; 
; I named the image "The Whole Universe", and so it is.  I gave it 
; no rating because I did virtually no work in producing it.  But 
; no one can complain about the calculation time of a superlumi-
; nal 28 seconds, which is about the time it will take to view the 
; completed image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Thursday was most unpleasant here at Fractal Central, as wet 
; sloppy snow and cold rain fell most of the day, while the temper-
; ature hung just above freezing.  The fractal cats spent the day 
; by the heat, ignoring the weather.
; 
; My day was uneventful.  The next FOTD will be posted here in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and even though the concept of an 
; ultimate reality might be a human invention, I really do believe 
; in the virtual reality of fractals.
