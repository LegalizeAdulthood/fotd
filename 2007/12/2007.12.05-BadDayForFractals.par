; FOTD -- December 05, 2007 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The FOTD is late again, which means that I was unable to get 
; connected to Mindspring in the evening once again.
; 
; When I find more spare time than expected, I sometimes write 
; short science-fiction and fantasy stories.  One story I wrote a 
; few years ago concerned voice communication with a humanoid 
; alien on a planet in a distant galaxy.  (For convenience we 
; forget the cosmic speed limit of light.)  The problem was to 
; communicate our earthly directions.
; 
; Communicating which directions are up and down was easy for our 
; earth man.  Up is toward the sky; down is toward the center of 
; the planet.  Communicating east and west was almost as easy.  
; East is where the sun rises; west is where it sets.  But then 
; the man on earth tried to think of a way to communicate north 
; and south.  He told the alien that when he faces east, north is 
; on his left side.  But the alien didn't know which hand was his 
; left hand, and to make matters worse, the bodies of his race had 
; perfect left-right symmetry.  When the man on earth then said 
; that the north pole is the one around which the sky appears to 
; rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, the distant alien asked 
; which way is counter-clockwise.  And so it went until both men 
; gave up in frustration.
; 
; I have been wondering ever since if a way actually exists to 
; communicate the left and right directions to someone on a 
; distant planet, who has no objects common to both parties to 
; refer to.  A non-symmetrical sub-atomic reaction might work, 
; since it would give an objective reality to these directions, 
; but this would raise a whole new series of technical problems.  
; In deep space the situation would be worse, but with no planets 
; in the vicinity, directions such as up-down, east-west and left-
; right would have little meaning.
; 
; Well, I seem to have gotten off the fractal track, and we have 
; a fractal to be concerned about.  It's another scene in the 
; parent fractal, which I have decided will be parent of the month.
; 
; Today's scene falls in the 'half-evaporated' category.  The 
; bailout radius has been raised just to the point where the 
; 'outside' stuff has been caught halfway through the evaporation 
; process.  I have rendered the scene with the 'inside' set to 
; 'atan' and the remaining outside still set to 'iter'.
; 
; In my opinion, the image is different enough to rate a lofty 8, 
; so that's where I rated it.  The name "Bad Day for Fractals" can 
; mean anything the viewer wishes.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes may be avoided by visiting 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished GIF image there.
; 
; Chilly, blustery weather with freezing temperatures and flurries 
; of snow prevailed here at Fractal Central on Tuesday, making the 
; day unpleasant for outside activity.  The cats ignored the snow 
; and crowded by the large radiator in the hallway.
; 
; My day was busy enough to keep boredom at bay.  The next FOTD 
; fractal will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; what's left is right.
