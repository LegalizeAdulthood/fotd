; FOTD -- December 23, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As promised, today's image shows the minibrot that lay invisibly 
; at the center of yesterday's image.  One glance shows why such 
; deep minibrots are disappointing.  The elements around the mini-
; brot are intricate enough, but they are so finely divided as to 
; be almost meaningless, and they are arranged in perfectly boring 
; perfect circles.  This circularity explains the name "Circles of 
; Numbers".
; 
; In fact, it appears that, as we approach the minibrot, the circu-
; lar bands of elements start to take the shape of the equal itera-
; ion bands of the parent Mandelbrot set.  It could be interesting 
; to check if this is true, but the calculation would be extremely 
; slow, and will have to wait until another day.
; 
; The rating of a 6 indicates that I was much more pleased with 
; the scenery on the way to today's minibrot than I was with what 
; I saw when I got there.  This is true of all extremely deep mini-
; brots.  The most interesting parts of the basins are so far out 
; from the center that the minibrots at the center are usually in-
; visible.
; 
; Another drawback of course is the extreme calculation time, 
; which in today's image is over an hour on the fast machine and 
; over 4 hours on the slow one.  But this will be no problem for 
; those who view the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy clouds and a temperature of 43F 6C made Saturday just an-
; other first day of winter here at Fractal Central.  The fractal 
; cats made the most of the brief daylight hours by watching all 
; afternoon for intruders.  In that time, they saw one dog pass 
; by.  My day was occupied by holiday preparations.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and a few nights ago I dreamed of a mountain.  Then someone told 
; me that the mountain was not real; it was all inside my head.  
; This might be true, but my head is much too small to hold a moun-
; tain.  I am now totally confused.  What is the real size of the 
; mountain I dreamed of?
