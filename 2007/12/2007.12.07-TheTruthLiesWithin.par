; 
; FOTD -- December 07, 2007 (Rating 9.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Only rarely do I find a fractal image worthy of an ionospheric 
; rating of 9-1/2, but today I have one.  (at least IMO)  It is a 
; scene in the East Valley of the largest midget on the main spike 
; of the fractal that will be the parent for the rest of December.
; 
; Don't think that this main spike is anything like the very 
; prominent main spike of the Mandelbrot set.  This main spike, 
; along with its entire period-2 radical, is misplaced so far to 
; the right that it actually lies in kind of an East Valley, and 
; it is so small as to be invisible unless it is magnified.
; 
; The extra half point rating was earned by the semi-expert (IMO) 
; coloring.  As for the name, "The Truth Lies Within", I chose it 
; because it sounds kind of new-agey, and the world of fractals is 
; close to the same age as the 'New Age', (read age-old), ideas.  
; And there is also something a bit mystical about the calculation 
; time of 4:44.44 on the P4.
; 
; I notice another peculiarity in the image.  There are 12 purple 
; elements forming the square, rather that the 2,4,8, . . . that 
; would be expected. 
; 
; I could go into detail about why I consider the image so good.  
; It has something to do with the large expanse of near-neutral 
; colors.  But the best way to see the reason for the astronomical 
; rating is to ponder the image, which speaks loudly for itself.  
; (Hmmm . . . we seem to have a talking fractal!)
; 
; The calculation time of 4-3/4 minutes is a bit slow, but relief 
; is at hand on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the completed image is posted for instant viewing.
; 
; The Wednesday snow ended, and the sky cleared at nightfall here 
; at Fractal Central.  The clear skies and light winds let the 
; temperature drop to 12F -11C by sunrise Thursday.  The rest of 
; Thursday was chilly, but with light wind and full sun the after-
; noon temperature of 32F 0C felt rather pleasant.  The fractal 
; cats, whose motto is 'the warmer the better', hung out by the 
; radiators all day.
; 
; Once I finished the small amount of work on Thursday, the day 
; was pretty good, with lots of spare time, as the quality of the 
; day's fractal shows.  I expect a repeat tomorrow.  Until next 
; time, take care, and if the earth were turning in the opposite 
; direction, the stars would still rise in the east.  We would 
; have to switch the names of the east and west directions.  We 
; would also have to switch the names of the northern and southern 
; hemispheres, and redraw our maps upside-down, which would make 
; Australians and New Zealanders very happy.
