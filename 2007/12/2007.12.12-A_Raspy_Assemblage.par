; FOTD -- December 12, 2007 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I rated today's scene in the December parent fractal at an 8.5.  
; I gave it this rating because I like it.  It has a freshness 
; that rekindles my enthusiasm for the parent, which was starting 
; to become boring.  No more do we see the endless display of 
; terminal rings that have adorned so many of the previous images 
; for December.  In their place we see . . . well, I'm not sure 
; what we have.  I guess it's up to the individual fractalist to 
; decide what today's image holds.
; 
; The scene is located on the eastern side of the parent, in about 
; as unlikely a place as is ever checked.  I named the image "A 
; Raspy Assemblage" because of the raspy texture of the elements 
; along the edge.  The wedge-shaped bluish background sections of 
; the image consist of inside stuff made visible with the bof61 
; inside fill.  The shredded arms in the foreground are outside 
; stuff rendered with the outside set to imag.
; 
; The little over 3 minutes it takes to run the included parameter 
; file will pass in a flash once the image starts to take shape.  
; And if running a parameter file is too much trouble, the image 
; is, or soon will be available for viewing on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Another miserable day's weather passed unappreciated here at 
; Fractal Central on Tuesday.  When the cold morning drizzle 
; became a steady afternoon rain, and the temperature quit at 36F 
; 2C, the fractal cats rolled over, took a quick glance, and went 
; back to sleep.  Cats don't like cloudy chilly days.
; 
; My day was busy enough to prevent boredom.  Tomorrow is likely 
; to be the same.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and if the mind is in the brain, and the brain 
; is a sense-created image in the mind, how do we get off this 
; wheel of circular reasoning without arbitrarily assuming that 
; physical material is the ultimate reality?
