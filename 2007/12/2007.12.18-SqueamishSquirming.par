; FOTD -- December 18, 2007 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's glorious (IMO) image lies in the decoration surrounding 
; the large northwestern ring of the parent fractal for December.  
; I named it "Squeamish Squirming" because the words sound rather 
; comical when used together, and the image actually is a bit on 
; the comical side.
; 
; The rating of a 6-1/2 includes the usual half-point reward for 
; my superb (once again IMO) coloring.  And why not?  After all, 
; it really is difficult to achieve reasonably smooth gradations 
; with only 256 colors to work with.
; 
; After yesterday's fractal, which calculated about as fast as 
; silly putty flows, today's image, with its FTL calculation time 
; of 46 seconds, will seem like a well-earnrd reward.  So why not 
; reward yourself?  Save this entire message in your Fractint 
; directory in text format with a .par extension and run it like 
; any other parameter file.
; 
; Unfortunately, in this advanced computer age, DOS applications 
; and the trimmings that go with them are about as up-to-date as 
; magic lanterns.  If your machine is over-qualified for Fractint, 
; leaving you in the dark, the image may be viewed on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Cold biting winds, ice-covered pavements, and a temperature just 
; below freezing made Monday a day to be forgotten here at New 
; Fractal Central.  The fractal cats forgot the day before it was 
; half finished.  They were more interested in keeping as warm as 
; possible and being fed as often as possible.
; 
; For me the day was uneventful.  The necessary work was behind me 
; by lunch time, leaving the afternoon for the un-necessary work 
; of finding fractals.  Today's image shows that I was moderately 
; successful.  The next in the long series of FOTD images will 
; appear here in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and here on 
; earth the universe is 13,700,000,000 years old.  But in a proto-
; galaxy 12,000,000,000 light-years distant from earth it is only 
; 1,700.000.000 years old.  What then is the true universal age of 
; the universe?  (I suspect the question is meaningless.)
