; FOTD -- July 26, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; To create today's parent fractal I corrected the error that has 
; plagued the FOTD images for the past two days.  I changed 1.68 
; to 1.618.  This change makes a surprisingly large difference in 
; the appearance of the resulting fractal, which grows even larger 
; and looses even more of its main stem, while the Elephant Valley 
; wedge grows narrower and more chaotic.  Today's image is located 
; in an area of near total chaos in Elephant Valley.
; 
; I named the image "Before or Behind" because the depth of its 
; elements is ambiguous.  Is the large chaotic area that contains 
; the midget in front of the light blue background or is it behind 
; that background?  Its position is especially confusing when the 
; blue background turns a bright red, then fades to black spirals, 
; curling around and apparently now in front of the chaotic area. 
; Actually,  the question is meaningless, for no depth is involved 
; at all.  It's all done with colors.
; 
; When I finished tweaking the colors, I rated the image at a 7.  
; It might not be the grandest 7-rated image of all time, but what 
; the h...?  I decided to reward myself for the extra effort I put 
; into the color palette.
; 
; No one can complain about the calculation time of 42 seconds.  
; Such a brief wait would make even a zero-rated image a bargain.
; 
; And everyone loves a fractal with no wait at all.  For this sur-
; prise go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the finished GIF image there instantly.
; 
; An average (partly cloudy, 84F 29C) midsummer day went un-
; noticed here at Fractal Central on Wednesday.  Of course, I 
; noticed it.  Otherwise, how would I know it was average?  The 
; fractal cats scampered around the house all afternoon.  They 
; were angels most of the time, but Cassie managed to get into 
; trouble when she grabbed an incoming fax from the tray and 
; ran off with it.  The fractal cats are fascinated by the 
; workings of fax machines.
; 
; My day was average.  Tomorrow will likely be the same.  The next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and some-
; times a fractal doesn't know whether it's coming or going.
