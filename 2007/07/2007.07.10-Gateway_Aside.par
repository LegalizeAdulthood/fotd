; FOTD -- July 10, 2007 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is another unfamiliar side view of the prominent 
; north valley of the Mandelbrot set.  It is sliced in a different 
; direction and the slice is centered at a different point, but 
; the valley still appears as a narrow slit.
; 
; It may seem surprising that the valley still appears as a slit 
; when such a different slice is made of it, but we must remember 
; that the whole valley is a four-dimensional thing, and the sharp 
; edges of it are actually two-dimensional surfaces, making the 
; ways in which it can be sliced nearly infinite.
; 
; Yes, I realize that it makes no sense to think of a flat surface 
; as being sharp, but in 4-D space this is true.  The cutting edge 
; of a 4-D knife would be a flat surface of 2 dimensions.
; 
; I could rate today's image no higher than a 4.  It actually 
; might be a little better than yesterday's everyday slice of the 
; north valley, but it is the second consecutive view of the same 
; thing, which knocks a point or two off its rating.
; 
; I named the image "Gateway Aside" since it is a side view of the 
; gateway to the north bud.  The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes 
; is well within reason.  In fact, it is almost as reasonable as 
; taking a trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the completed GIF image there.
; 
; A high temperature of 97F 36C made Monday unpleasant here at 
; Fractal Central.  The cats noted how hot it was on the other 
; side of the window, then turned their attention to a chipmunk 
; scampering through the grass in the yard.
; 
; My day turned busier than expected when two small but unexpected 
; jobs came in, but the rush vanished when fractal lady pitched in 
; to help.  The day ended with me finding the fractal that passes 
; for today's FOTD.  The next FOTD fractal will likely appear in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and live every minute.
