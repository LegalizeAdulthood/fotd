; FOTD -- July 01, 2007 (Not Rated)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The weather on Saturday turned out so beautiful that we decided 
; to take a day off to enjoy the central Pennsylvania countryside. 
; This explains the lateness of the first FOTD for July '07.  And 
; speaking of the FOTD, it's a scene showing a midget in the 
; fractal that results when the formula Z^(1.1)+C is iterated 11 
; levels up the complex logarithmic hyperspiral.
; 
; The explosion-like features around the little midget have been 
; seen many times before, but the midget itself, with its arrow-
; head shape, is kind of a rarity.  This is why I chose it to be 
; today's FOTD.
; 
; Unfortunately, a fractal that is found so quickly can hardly be 
; given a fair rating, so I gave today's image no official rating. 
; I did name it "This Way Out" however, when I noticed the resem-
; blance to a directional arrow.
; 
; The calculation time of 9-1/2 minutes on the P2000 computer is 
; not too outrageous, and the completed image can always be seen 
; instantly on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Absolutely perfect weather prevailed all day Saturday here at 
; Fractal Central.  The high temperature was 79F 26C, the sky was 
; blue and decorated with puffy cumulus clouds, which cast their 
; shadows on the surrounding hills.  The humidity was low, and the 
; wind was gentle.  But the fractal cats were out of sorts, due to 
; too little attention.  With another perfect day due on Sunday, 
; they will probably be out of sorts again.
; 
; My day was actually quite enjoyable.  Tomorrow will likely be a 
; repeat.  The next FOTD is due in about 22 hours, but I would not 
; be surprised if it is late again.  Until then, take care, and if 
; the world is an illusion, is the illusion real?
