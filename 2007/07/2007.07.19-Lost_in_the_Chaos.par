; FOTD -- July 19, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD is a bit late, but better late than never.  The 
; image is a scene in the same parent fractal that brought us the 
; two most recent FOTD's.  But whereas yesterday's image was 
; located in the center of the valley on the positive X-axis of 
; the parent fractal; today's image is located in a kind of debris-
; filled elephant trunk on the shoreline of the valley.
; 
; I named the image "Lost in the Chaos" because most of the image 
; consists of a sea of pure chaos, a rather unlikely place to find 
; a quadratic Mandelbrot midget.  But there is just enough order 
; amid the chaos to make an image marginally worthy of FOTD 
; status.  Though the image is by no means exceptional.
; 
; To express my moderate satisfaction, I rated the image at a 6.  
; The calculation time of 3-1/2 minutes is true on the fast 
; 2000mhz machine.  The old 200mhz unit would take near 20 minutes 
; to complete the calculation.  The best way to see the image is 
; to forget the calculation and go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the complete image will soon be posted for instant 
; viewing.  But before going give Paul a chance to post the image. 
; 
; The problem with the weather here at New Fractal Central on 
; Wednesday was too much humidity.  Had the air been drier, the 
; temperature of 82F 28C would have been quite comfortable.  A few 
; raindrops that fell from heavy clouds in the morning amounted to 
; nothing.  The fractal cats were on their best behavior all day.
; 
; My day was filled with a lack of excitement, not that I wanted 
; any that is.  The work was finished with time to spare, and the 
; fractal turned out just far enough above average to make it 
; worth the effort.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours, rain 
; or shine.  Until then, take care, and a fractal is never in vain.
