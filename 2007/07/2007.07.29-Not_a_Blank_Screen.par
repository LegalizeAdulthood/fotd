; FOTD -- July 29, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Before I begin today's discussion, I must warn that there is a 
; bug in the parameter file.  When the image is run directly from 
; the parameter file, the imag(p3) parameter comes up as some 
; ridiculous negative number, resulting in a blank screen.  To see 
; the correct image, the imag(p3) parameter must be re-entered by 
; hand to the correct value of 3900000000 or 3.9e+009.  When this 
; is done, the image generates normally.  I have no idea what the 
; bug is.
; 
; And my apologies for the late FOTD.  Fractal lady and I decided 
; to take the day off on Saturday to enjoy the countryside.  We 
; did so much enjoying that it was almost 11pm when we made it 
; back exhausted to Fractal Central.
; 
; For today's fractal we return to the MandAutoCritInZ formula, 
; and check the fractal that results when various parts of 
; Z^(-1.1) and Z^(-7.7) are mixed before (1/C) is added.  The 
; resulting parent fractal is a grossly oversized thing with a 
; prominent 'fan' on the X-axis, with the handle facing west.  
; Today's image is located in a bit of fractal decoration on the 
; blade of this fan.
; 
; The bailout in today's image is almost 4-thousand-million.  I 
; was working with different parameters when I noticed that the 
; fan evaporates as the bailout is raised.  This evaporation 
; starts at the handle and proceeds toward the edge.  I set 
; today's bailout to the point where the area of today's image is 
; just about ready to evaporate, and rendered the fractal with the 
; inside set to 'bof61'.  The resulting image is a cross between a 
; conventional image and an evaporated one.
; 
; I named the image "Not a Blank Screen" for the obvious reason.  
; If you see a blank screen, you have not changed the imag(p3) 
; parameter.  Then I rated it at a 7, which is the minimum rating 
; that I consider satisfactory.  In comparison to yesterday's 
; image, which takes nearly an eternity to finish, today's 
; finishes in under one minute on the fast P2000 machine and about 
; 5 minutes on the P200.
; 
; The image is also available for viewing on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; but because of the unusual time of day, and the bug in the 
; parameter file, it may be a few hours before it is posted there. 
; So be patient.
; 
; It was a bit too warm and muggy for perfection here at Fractal 
; Central on Saturday, but the fractal cats didn't mind.  When we 
; returned late in the evening, we found Nicholas sleeping in the 
; magazine rack and Cassie curled on the coffee table, both of 
; them happy but hungry.
; 
; Tomorrow's FOTD will be another good one, and it will appear in 
; only 12 hours.  Until then, take care, and save energy; shower 
; with a fractal.
