; FOTD -- July 25, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's image we return to the same parent fractal that held 
; yesterday's image.  This fractal resulted when I mistakenly sub-
; tracted Z^(1.68) from Z^(1.4142) instead of subtracting the 
; Z^(1.618), Golden Ratio which I had originally intended.
; 
; This parent fractal is a very large near-Mandelbrot set, with a 
; messed up Elephant Valley and a runt-like main positive stem.  
; In yesterday's image we examined the inner detail of Elephant 
; Valley; in today's image we examine the detail of the abortive 
; main stem.
; 
; What we find there is an area reminiscent of the railyard effect 
; found in the negative X-axis area of fractals such as the one 
; created by the formula Z^(2.003)+C.  And as along that fractal's 
; negative X-axis, today's parent fractal is chock full of midgets 
; along its positive X-axis.  Today's image shows one of these.
; 
; I named the image "Why Me?".  I gave it this name when I consid-
; ered the vanishingly small chance that this particular fractal 
; would ever see the light of day.  I rated it at a 6 because to 
; me it seems just a tiny bit above FOTD average.  If I had put 
; more effort into the coloring, I might have raised the image to 
; a rating of a 7, but I fear the rating of a modest 6 will remain 
; forever fixed.
; 
; One thing that will not remain forever fixed however is the 
; calculation time.  As computers get ever faster, the calculation 
; time will shrink from its present 1-1/3 minutes on a P2000, and 
; no one can say how brief that time may eventually come to be.  
; But the fastest and easiest way to see the image today is to 
; forget calculating it and view it on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Tuesday turned out average in all respects here at Fractal 
; Central.  The weather was neither unusually good nor bad, the 
; work was neither unusually heavy nor light, the fractal cats 
; were their typical selves, and the day's fractal is neither good 
; nor bad.  It is a routine slightly above average.
; 
; I'll try again tomorrow to find a truly great image.  Of course 
; there is no guarantee of success.  I don't find most of the FOTD 
; fractals.  They find me.  Until 24 hours have passed, take care, 
; and don't take a fractal sitting down.
