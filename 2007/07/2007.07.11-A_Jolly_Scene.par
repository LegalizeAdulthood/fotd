; FOTD -- July 11, 2007 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I must once again apologize for the lateness of the FOTD.  My 
; excuse is that the weather was very hot on Tuesday and I felt 
; lazy.  It's really no excuse, but it is the truth.
; 
; The image that I found when I finally mustered the energy to 
; search is a scene in a valley of the Z^sqrt(2)+C Mandeloid as it 
; appears a meager 1/2 level up the complex logarithmic hyper-
; spiral.  This formula is one of my favorites.  It is not as rich 
; as its square, the classic Mandelbrot set, but there is only one 
; fractal that can be generated by the formula Z^2+C, while the 
; formula Z^sqrt(2)+C creates nearly an infinity of fractals, all 
; different yet all strangely the same.
; 
; I'll not try to describe the parent fractal, since it is so 
; easily generated, but the image I found within it rather reminds 
; me of a gala event, which inspired the name "A Jolly Scene".  
; The rating of an average 5 says very little about the image.  I 
; did not put enough work into it to rate it any higher, and this 
; type of image has been posted as the FOTD so many times that it 
; has become hackneyed.
; 
; The parameter file takes 9-1/2 minutes to run on the fast 
; computer.  On the slow machine it would take 45 minutes to 
; finish.  For convenience the parameter file has been calculated 
; and posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a temperature of 97F 36C and oppressive humidity here at 
; Fractal Central, Tuesday was a day to be ignored.  And indeed 
; the fractal cats did ignore it.  They concerned themselves with 
; the chipmunks (I think there are two of them) that have been 
; running around in the back yard grass.
; 
; I concerned myself with work first and fractals second.  The 
; result speaks for itself in the parameter file.  As always, the 
; next in the series of FOTD fractals will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and wait with bated but not abated breath.
