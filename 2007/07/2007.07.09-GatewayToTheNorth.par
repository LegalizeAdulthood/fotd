; FOTD -- July 09, 2007 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yes, the FOTD is a little late again today.  I decided to take 
; it easy on my day off.  But a fractal was found, and here it is, 
; better late than never in all its semi glory.
; 
; I named the image "Gateway to the North".  Actually, that's what 
; it is.  In today's image we have a side view (from above) of the 
; valley of the large north period-3 bud of the Mandelbrot set.  I 
; found little in the image that I could consider above average, 
; so I rated it at an average 5.
; 
; The image is not a perturbed Mandelbrot set, nor is it a Julia 
; set.  It is an oblique slice of the 4-dimensional Julibrot 
; figure.  The actual orientation, as shown by the imag(p1) para-
; meter, is about 1/3 of the way from the Parabolic orientation 
; toward the Elliptic.
; 
; A good bit of stretching in the vertical direction was necessary 
; to give the image reasonable proportions.  Almost all of the 
; 3-minute calculation time is spent calculating the few lines in 
; the center that consist of 'inside' stuff, where the calculation 
; almost comes to a halt.  This slowness is due to the extreme 
; maxiter of 350,000.
; 
; As always, the image is or soon will be posted on the FOTD web 
; site for instant viewing.  The FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather was a bit too warm to be absolutely perfect here at 
; Fractal Central on Sunday.  But it came pretty close to perfec-
; tion.  Much sun and a temperature of 93F 34C made water sports 
; the activity of choice.  For the fractal cats, the activity of 
; choice was sleeping and eating.
; 
; My day was notably lazy, which I hope does not show too much in 
; the fractal.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and ease that stress with a fractal.
