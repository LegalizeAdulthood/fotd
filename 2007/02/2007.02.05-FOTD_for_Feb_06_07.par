; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In the FOTD discussions, I keep talking about a mysterious 
; 'parent fractal'.  The parent is really not so mysterious 
; however.  It is simply the entire fractal created by the 
; generating formula.
; 
; Today's image is such a parent fractal.  It resulted when I 
; combined 0.65 part of Z^(-1.4142) with 0.65 part of Z^(1.4142) 
; and added straight C.  Like so many fractals created by the 
; M-Mix4 formula, it appears to be two fractals in one.
; 
; The main Mandeloid in the image is immediately obvious, but in 
; the background lies part of a larger and unseen fractal.  This 
; unseen fractal appears as the bright stuff in the parent 
; fractal.  Its buds are apparent, but it is obviously a 'ghost' 
; fractal.  I suspect that the generating formula has more than 
; one critical point, and this unseen fractal is what would appear 
; if Z were initialized to another critical point.
; 
; As it is, the image, with its deep blues and purples, is a 
; rather somber one.  Since I didn't even try to explore deeper 
; into the fractal, I could hardly give it a name or rating, but 
; it's still a pleasant thing to see, and with a calculation time 
; of under 3 minutes, little time will have been wasted if the 
; result is disappointing.
; 
; The finished image will soon be posted to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it may easily be viewed.
; 
; Today was downright arctic here at Fractal Central.  Enough sun 
; broke through the clouds to make the day bright, but the brisk 
; wind and temperature around 12F -11C made it risky to stay ex-
; posed for too long.  The fractal cats never expose themselves to 
; the weather however.  They were quite satisfied to lie near the 
; large radiator in the hallway, which was going full blast.
; 
; As today's super-quick fractal shows, my day was very busy.  And 
; to make things worse, the heavy work will likely continue for 
; another week at least.  So far I have been able to keep the FOTD 
; going.  Hopefully, I'll be able to keep it going during the 
; coming week.  The next in the long series of never-before-seen 
; fractals will almost certainly appear on schedule in 24 hours.  
; Of course, 'almost' is no 100-percent guarantee, so check back 
; tomorrow at this same time. Until then, take care, and if time, 
; like space, is quantized, how long is the present moment?
