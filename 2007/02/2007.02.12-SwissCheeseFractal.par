; FOTD -- February 12, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal image gives a sample of what goes on in the 
; fractal that results when Z^(+0.95) is combined with Z^(-0.95) 
; and straight C is added.  The first thing that happens is the 
; evaporation of the parent fractal, and this is not due to an 
; excessive bailout radius.  Today's parent fractal is so far gone 
; in fact that it has degenerated into a smooth-edged circle, with 
; only a bit of fractal action on its western extremity.  
; 
; Today's scene is located in what I assume to be the partially-
; evaporated remnants of the bud side of the north branch of Sea-
; horse Valley.
; 
; Most of the coloring effect was achieved by rendering the image 
; with the outside set to 'imag'.
; 
; I named the image "Swiss Cheese Fractal" since to me at least, 
; that's what it looks like.  And I rated it at a 7, since I 
; consider it above the recent FOTD average.  The calculation time 
; of 6-3/4 minutes is longer than yesterday's super-quick image, 
; but still fast as fractal times go.
; 
; The fastest way of all to view the image however is to go to the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it is or soon will be posted for public viewing.
; 
; Light winds, ample sun and a temperature of 37F 3C here at 
; Fractal Central on Sunday made conditions pretty average. The 
; fractal cats complemented the weather by being on their average 
; behavior.  In my world, things were still quite busy, and will 
; stay that way for a week or two.  But regardless, the next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and fractal 
; luck be with you.
