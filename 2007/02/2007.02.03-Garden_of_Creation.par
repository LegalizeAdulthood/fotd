; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For a change, today's image has been given a name.  After a 
; moment's pondering I named it "Garden of Creation".  A whimsical 
; set of parameters set the stage for today's fractal effort, 
; which unlike the origin sometimes attributed to the universe, 
; definitely had a creator.
; 
; The universe came into being because it could be no other way.  
; Whether that can be considered creation depends on one's 
; individual philosophy.  There are many creation stories among 
; the world's many cultures, not the least of which is the story 
; of the Garden of Eden.
; 
; Today's image gives a fractal peek at that primordial garden of 
; perfect happiness.  We see trees of the most fantastic kind 
; bearing unearthly fruit ready for the picking.  I have not yet 
; spotted the two dwellers in the garden, but I assume they are in 
; there somewhere.
; 
; Though I did give the image a name, I declined to give it a 
; rating.  But this does not mean it is in any way inferior.  The 
; render time of a brief 3-1/4 minutes is short enough for the 
; most impatient.  Those with balky computers may view the garden 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Crystal blue skies, a biting wind, and a temperature of 30F -1C 
; made it chilly today here at Fractal Central.  The next few days 
; are due to be even colder.  The fractal cats were quiet.  As 
; long as they have their heat, they do not concern themselves 
; with outdoor conditions.
; 
; My day was very busy.  The fractal is serendipitous.  The next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and why am 
; I myself?  Could it be mere definition?
