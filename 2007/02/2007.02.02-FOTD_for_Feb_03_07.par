; FOTD -- February 03, 2007 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; If anything, the rush intensified today.  Things are actually so 
; busy that I am starting to wonder if the work is worth all the 
; stress and anxiety.  Sometimes things get so hectic that I feel 
; like entering the nearest monastery.  But I wonder if monks have 
; fractals to remind them of their god.
; 
; Today's image shows a midget in the fractal that results when 
; various portions of Z^(-1.111) and Z^(-11.11) are combined and 
; (1/C) is added.  This parent has a glorious 'fan' -- one of the 
; best I have yet come upon.  Today's image is not located in the 
; 'fan' however.  It is found at the center of a vague spiral on 
; the southwest edge of the oversized parent fractal.
; 
; In keeping with the trend of the times, I gave today's image 
; neither name nor rating.  But this does not mean I consider the 
; image to be bad.  I simply was too rushed to give it much 
; thought.
; 
; The 31-minute render time is admittedly slow.  But all is not 
; lost; a fractal bicarb is available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image will soon be posted for immediate enjoyment.
; 
; Clouds, occasional light snow, and a temperature of 34F 1C made 
; things wet and uncomfortable here at Fractal Central on Friday.  
; The fractal cats did their best to stay comfortable by the 
; radiator.  As stated above, my day was very busy, and from the 
; looks of things I may stay busy well into next week.  The next 
; FOTD is due in 24 hours.  If all goes well, it will be a great 
; one.  Until then, take care, and hope for greatness to prevail.
