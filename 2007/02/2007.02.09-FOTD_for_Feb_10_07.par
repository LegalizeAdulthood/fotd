; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal formula takes Z^(1.15), subtracts Z^(0.15) from 
; it, then adds straight C.  The resulting parent fractal is a 
; main bay.  It is not a Mandeloid with a main bay, it is simply a 
; main bay without the Mandel buds.  It has the expected East 
; Valley, but only very tiny indents mar the smoothness of its 
; shoreline.  Today's scene is located on the western shore of the 
; bay, just north of the X-axis.
; 
; I seem to be getting into a rut, but once again I feel that the 
; image failed to receive the effort needed to be worth a name or 
; rating.  So I merely gave it a catalog listing and let it go 
; unrated.
; 
; Actually, considering that it was done with the traditional 
; outside=iter method, it's an unusually lively image.  And its 
; render time of under 7 minutes lies just beyond the limits of 
; slowness.
; 
; Perhaps the most convenient way to enjoy the image is to view it 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it and earlier FOTD images are posted for quick access.
; 
; Lots of sun, less wind, and a temperature of 34F 1C made Friday 
; comparatively pleasant here at Fractal Central.  The fractal 
; cats must have agreed, because they were in unusually good moods 
; most all day.  Their only complaint came when their tuna treat 
; was not served on time.
; 
; My day was unusually busy again.  The rush is good for business, 
; but the stress is bad for both body and spirit.  BTW, fractals 
; are the best stress fighter I know of, and the next one will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and a fractal a day 
; keeps the blues away.
