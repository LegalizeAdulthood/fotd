; FOTD -- February 08, 2007 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's un-named and un-rated image lies in the fractal that 
; comes into being when 0.5 parts of Z^3 are combined with 5 parts 
; of Z and C is then added.  This parent fractal is a variety of 
; Mandelbrot set rotated 90 degrees so than its normally west side 
; is facing south.  A series of dots and dashes appears along the 
; Y-axis, extending north from East Valley of the M-set.  Today's 
; image lies in one of these dots.
; 
; I put almost no effort into the image, a lack which does show.  
; The only special effect came about when I rendered the image 
; with the outside set to 'tdis' rather than the usual 'iter'.  
; This does add a bit of life to the scene, but not enough to earn 
; it a title.
; 
; Perhaps the best feature of today's FOTD is its very short calcu-
; lation time of 1-1/3 minutes.  The image may also be seen by 
; going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing it posted there.
; 
; We had a 2-inch, 5cm snowfall Tuesday night here at Fractal 
; Central, but the snow was so fluffy that by the time the sun 
; went down Wednesday, the snow had almost totally vanished.  The 
; high temperature of 23F -5C on Wednesday was far too cold for 
; any self-respecting cat, much less for the fractal cats who 
; have no self-respect.
; 
; My day was busy, but at the same time it was as close to an 
; average day as we have seen in several weeks.  The next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours or so.  Until then, take care, and see 
; you in fractal land.
