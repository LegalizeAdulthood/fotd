; FOTD -- March 23, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The formula behind today's image mixes 3 parts of Z^(-1.5) with 
; 0.6 part of Z^(-7.5), then adds (1/C).  Using (1/C) rather than 
; plain C turns the already inside-out parent fractal inside-out 
; again, which gives a fractal with the inside where it should be 
; -- on the inside.  Curiously, the 'evaporated' version of today's 
; image is virtually the same as the image itself when the 'bof61' 
; inside fill is used.
; 
; The parent fractal somewhat resembles a snowman with his head 
; facing east and his fat bottom on the west end.  A little 
; stretch of the imagination will also reveal two Mickey-Mouse 
; ears sprouting from the snowman's head.
; 
; The scene of today's image is located in a spiral in a disconnec-
; ted bit of fractal debris in the interior of the southern branch 
; of the valley that defines the snowman's neck.  (Of course, all 
; proper snowmen have necks.)
; 
; Though I did not give today's image a name, I did give it a 
; rating of a 6.  The calculation time of 24 minutes is slower 
; than FOTD average, but not outrageously so.  And the calculation 
; may be totally avoided by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the completed image is posted ready for viewing.
; 
; I was recently asked how I find good parameters for the formula 
; that I use so often -- the MandelbrotMix4.  A number of years 
; ago I described how I find good parameters for this formula, but 
; I have advanced since then.  As soon as the current busy period 
; here at Fractal Central slows down, I'll describe my method of 
; finding parameters and include it in a FOTD discussion.  But I 
; will admit now that some degree of luck is involved.
; 
; Tuesday was sunny but chilly (43F 5C), Wednesday was partly 
; cloudy and chilly (45F 6C), Thursday was mostly sunny and mild 
; here at Fractal Central, with a midday temperature of 66F 19C.  
; Clouds arrived in the afternoon however, and light rain set in 
; during the evening.
; 
; During this time, I was too busy at the computer to be concerned 
; with the outside conditions.  (I did check the waether records 
; however.)  The fractal cats were equally unconcerned.  They 
; never seem to concern themselves with the outside weather as 
; long as it is warm inside.
; 
; The present big rush is down to manageable proportions, so there 
; should be no immediate interruptions in the steady flow of FOTD 
; images.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and I often wonder about the meaning of fractals.  
; Their existence was barely suspected before Julia first realized 
; that something surprising happens when certain complex numbers 
; are reiterated.  But maybe the very concept of ultimate meaning 
; is only another human invention.
