; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I keep trying to find things in the Mandeloids with an exponent 
; of Z between 1 and 2.  I have never had much success, but I just 
; can't seem to give up.  Today's un-named and unrated image lies 
; in the Z^(sqrt(2))+C Mandeloid as it appears 54 levels up the 
; logarithmic ladder.
; 
; At this level, the parent Mandeloid resembles a bent mushroom, 
; with its cap on the northeast side and its bent stem jutting out 
; toward the southwest.  Today's image is located in a filament 
; extending from a small distorted bud sitting on the top of the 
; mushroom's cap.
; 
; The image was created with the MandelbrotBC2 formula, the second 
; most useful formula in my collection.  This formula takes advan-
; tage of the multi-valued nature of the complex log function.  It 
; calculates a virtually limitless number of the fractals that the 
; infinity of possible log values can create.
; 
; In my experience, I found that the most interesting fractals 
; result when the exponent of Z is set to a value between one and 
; two.  The value of today's exponent happens to be the square 
; root of two.  I often use significant numbers such as square and 
; cube roots as exponents.  It doesn't make much of a difference 
; in the finished product, but it adds a bit of fun.
; 
; The value given real(p2) determines the level of the logarithmic 
; ladder at which the formula will be calculated.  I have found 
; that with this parameter, one guess is as good as another.  The 
; exception is a value of PI, which calculates the ground level of 
; the formula.
; 
; Today's image may have no name or rating, but it makes up for 
; this lack by its speed.  The included parameter file calculates 
; in only 2 minutes, about the same time required to visit the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the finished image there.
; 
; Heavy clouds and light rain kept a damper on outdoor things here 
; at Fractal Central on Friday.  The temperature of 54F 12C was 
; within reason, but few people ventured outside to enjoy it.  The 
; fractal cats spent most of the day washing each other's faces.  
; Indoor cats usually do not concern themselves with weather.
; 
; My day was rather busy.  Unless something unexpected comes up 
; however, the rush should be ended by next week.  The next FOTD 
; will be posted at this same spot in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and be vigilant.
