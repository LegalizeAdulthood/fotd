; FOTD -- March 27, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's parent fractal came about when I combined 0.1 part of 
; Z^(10.5) with 1 part of Z^(1.05) and added straight C.  It 
; reminds me of a Mandelbrot set with a clumsily trimmed peacock's 
; tail.  The head of the set faces east-northeast, while the 
; peacock tail extends out from the East Valley area toward the 
; west-southwest.  Today's scene is located in the peacock tail.
; 
; I almost gave today's image a name.  But at the last minute I 
; decided it had been given too little effort to be worth naming.  
; The coloring is responsible for almost the entire effect of the 
; image.  Since I did put a little extra effort into the coloring, 
; I did give the image a rating.  I rated it at a 6.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes is pleasingly brief.  The 
; time required to view the image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; is equally brief and even more convenient.
; 
; In a day or so, I will include an article I am writing, telling 
; how I pick good parameters for the MandelbrotMix4 formula, which 
; automatically initializes Z to a critical value of the expresion 
; being iterated.  A critical value of a function is a point where 
; the rate of change of the function is zero.  When an expression 
; is iterated with Z initialized to a critical point, the result-
; ing fractal is most likely to contain intact midget Mandelbrot 
; sets.  The critical point of the formula of the classic Mandel-
; brot set, Z^2+C, is zero, but this is not true for most formulas 
; that contain more than one exponent of Z, such as those calcula-
; ted by the MandelbrotMix4 formula.
; 
; Lots of clouds obscured the sun here at Fractal Central on 
; Monday, but the temperature reached a very mild 59F 15C.  The 
; fractal cats ignored the weather.  They were too busy chasing 
; each other up and down the hallway.  Nicholas, the big clumsy 
; one, got a bit out of control when he leaped onto a table and 
; knocked over a lamp.  Luckily the lamp was not harmed and Nico 
; escaped with only a warning.  Cassie, the small, delicate and 
; very agile lady, watched all this with amusement.
; 
; My day was about average.  Unless something goes wrong, tomorrow 
; will be the same.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and surround yourself with the fractal light.
