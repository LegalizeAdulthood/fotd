; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image exists in the fractal that results when the 
; formula Z^(2.003)+C is iterated 300 levels up the logarithmic 
; ladder.  The parent fractal at first looks like a classic 
; Mandelbrot set rotated 50 degrees, but closer examination 
; reveals small but interesting changes along the negative X-axis, 
; which cuts through the area of the period-5 radical on the south-
; west shoreline of the main bay of the M-set.
; 
; BTW, this formula is the one that holds the curious Julia 
; rectangle that I return to every so often.  If real(p2) is set 
; to PI, which is the true ground level of the logarithmic ladder, 
; the rectangle will appear in its proper place.
; 
; While yesterday's image showed an unusually smooth scene, the 
; image for today shows an unusually busy scene.  The picture is 
; so busy in fact that I gave it neither a name nor a rating.  The 
; calculation time of just over 11 minutes could be shorter, but 
; those who take the time to run the included parameter file will 
; not be disappointed with the result.
; 
; Those who are as busy as I am may save the time by going to the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the image there.
; 
; Monday dawned clear but quite cold here at Fractal Central, with 
; a temperature of 14F -10C.  Strong morning sun raised the temper-
; ature to 41F 5C by noon, when clouds moved in and halted the 
; rise.  Light snow set in at 3pm, but changed to rain by 5pm.  
; The fractal cats were concerned with none of this.  They were 
; more interested in chasing each other up and down the hallway.
; 
; My day was once again quite busy.  This busy-ness is getting to 
; be the standard situation, which leads me to wonder if it's time 
; to start thinking of slowing down.  If I do slow down, it will 
; not be in the world of fractals.  I cannot slow down with the 
; fractals.  My time is limited but fractals are infinite.  And no 
; matter how many fractals I find, I will still have seen zero per-
; cent of all that are possible.  The next fractal will appear in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if eternity is outside of 
; time, will it be possible to see every possible fractal?
