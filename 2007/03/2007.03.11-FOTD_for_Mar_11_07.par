; FOTD -- March 11, 2007 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; This version has the correct, souped up color palette for 
; today's image.  I forgot to insert it in the first version. 
; 
; There was no FOTD for March 10 because I had no time to create 
; one.  But today's FOTD, which resembles a fantastic undersea 
; creature, should more than make up for the lapse. 
; 
; Today's image came about when I added 0.2 part of Z^2 to Z^(-2). 
; This formula creates the outline of a Mandelbrot set, which is 
; filled with debris, and this debris in turn is filled with 
; smaller M-sets.  Today's image was found in the negative X-axis 
; area of the large Mandelbrot outline.
; 
; I declined to name or rate the image, but its calculation time 
; of under 3 minutes should make the job of running the included 
; parameter file, if not a pleasure, at least not a chore.
; 
; Even more time may be saved by checking in at the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the completed image there.
; 
; A rather chilly but otherwise pleasant partly sunny day with a 
; high temperature of 46F 8C here at Fractal Central on Saturday 
; went totally unappreciated by the fractal cats, who, in keeping 
; with their fractal nature, appeared to be in several places at 
; once.  The light rain that set in by evening was no problem.
; 
; Their big excitement came just before noon, when Cassie spotted 
; an intruding cat walking down the sidewalk beside the house.  
; Somehow, Nico knew at once that she had seen something, and he 
; rushed to the window to see for himself.  But while nico was 
; rushing, the intruder finished his business and went on his way.
; 
; My day was continued busy.  Tomorrow looks to be the same.  But 
; unless something drastic comes up, the next FOTD will appear as 
; scheduled in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and wait for the 
; light with abated breath.
