; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is based on the formula Z^(sqrt(3))+C as it calcu-
; lates at the minus-PI level of the infinite logarithmic ladder. 
; The parent fractal created by this formula at this level closely 
; resembles a very distorted Mandelbrot set standing on its head.
; 
; Today's image shows the environs of a midget located in the East 
; Valley area of a larger midget close in on the main filament 
; extending from the large period-2 bud of the parent fractal.  
; Like the East-Valley midgets of the classic M-set, the midget in 
; today's scene resembles the Julia sets of the area.
; 
; I gave the image, which I found almost without trying, no 
; rating.  For a couple minutes I considered giving it a name, but 
; then I decided to let it go un-named.  I put too little effort 
; into the image to honor it with a clever name.
; 
; The render time of under 13 minutes will seem not nearly so long 
; once the brilliant colors become visible.  And those who choose 
; not to calculate the image may view the image on the FOTD web 
; site at:

; 
; Saturday started with an hour of shoveling snow here at Fractal 
; Central, but the 8-inch (17cm) snow was fluffy and easy to push 
; aside.  The rest of the day was mostly cloudy with the tempera-
; ture hovering just around freezing.  The fractal cats were 
; briefly interested in the unfamiliar appearance of the outside 
; world, which to them is a big forbidden room they never get to 
; enter.  Then they decided to get into a tussle and soon forgot 
; the world outside.
; 
; After I finished with the snow, my day was about average.  The 
; fractal I found is also about average.  What I need is a series 
; of above-average fractals, but those critters are easier to hope 
; for than to find.  The next in the long series of FOTD's will 
; appear right here in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be 
; lucky in your fractal search.
