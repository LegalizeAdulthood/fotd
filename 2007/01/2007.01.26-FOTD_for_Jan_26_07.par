; FOTD -- January 26, 2007 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The rush continued here at F.C. on Thursday, but one would never 
; guess it from the quality of the fractal, which I generously 
; rated at an 8 even though I declined to give it a name.  To 
; produce the image I combined Z^(-1.7) with 0.3 part of Z^(-5.5) 
; and added (1/C).  The resulting parent fractal resembles a snow-
; man with a gash in his head and a prominent Mandelbrot set 
; floating above his head like a halo.  Today's scene is located 
; at the edge of the gash in the snowman's head.
; 
; The special effects were hastily created by calculating the 
; image with the inside set to 'fmod' with a proximity of 0.615, 
; which is critical.  The rather spidery outside parts were 
; rendered with the 'tdis' option in effect.
; 
; With two negative exponents of Z in the generating formula, the 
; image can be 'evaporated'.  Tomorrow's FOTD, if it appears at 
; all, will feature one of these 'evaporated' versions of today's 
; scene.
; 
; The one bad feature of today's image is the calculation time, 
; which is well over 38 minutes.  But relief is at hand on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the already-rendered image is or soon will be posted for 
; instant viewing.
; 
; Partly cloudy skies unleashed several heavy snow showers here at 
; Fractal Central on Thursday, leaving behind about 3cm of powdery 
; snow, while the temperature of 23F -5C made things feel quite 
; winter-like.  The Fractal Cats survived the cold by keeping warm 
; next to the large radiator in the hall -- the one with the hole 
; where the mouse appeared a few months ago.  My day was suitably 
; busy, but not too busy to produce a fine fractal.  Unless some-
; thing unexpected comes up, the next FOTD will appear in 24 hours 
; or so.  Until then, take care, and be of good cheer even though 
; the holidays are gone.
