; FOTD -- January 18, 2007 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; An unexpectedly busy day cut into the time available for fractal 
; work, but I still managed to find an image worth looking at. 
; 
; The marginally worthwhile image came about when I combined 
; Z^(-1.6) with 0.4 part of Z^(-6.1) and added (1/C) to create a 
; parent fractal that cannot be described in words.  Today's image 
; was found, as so many fractals are, in a valley of the parent 
; fractal.  Most of the action was achieved by rendering the image 
; with the 'outside' set to 'tdis' and the 'inside' set to 'fmod'.
; 
; I gave the final image neither name nor rating.  I could not 
; honestly rate or name a FOTD that had so little effort put into 
; it.
; 
; The calculation time of 5-1/2 minutes may be conveniently 
; avoided by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the pre-calculated image there.  But before going to 
; the web site, allow an hour or so for the image to be posted.
; 
; A sunny but cold day, with a high temperature of only 32F 0C 
; here at Fractal Central on Wednesday, was ignored by the fractal 
; cats, who would rather warm themselves by the radiators than 
; watch the action outdoors.  My day was unexpectedly busy, and 
; tomorrow will likely be the same.  But regardless, the next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours, give or take a few.  Until then, take 
; care, and remember that clouds are fractals also.
