; FOTD -- January 04, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was calculated with the passes set to 't'.  I 
; rarely use this option because, with the current version of 
; Fractint, it recalculates the entire image when I want only to 
; center the central midget a little better.  The earlier versions 
; of the program simply add and subtract a bit of image around the 
; edges without recalculating the entire image.
; 
; And speaking of the image, what a strange looking critter it is. 
; I have named it "Stinging Nettle" for some reason I have long 
; since forgotten.  The rating of a 6 is good enough for a scene 
; with no obvious midget at the center.
; 
; The parent fractal was created by adding 11 parts of Z^(11) to 
; Z^(1.1) and then adding C to create a Mandeloid with a most 
; unusual east end, (which in today's case is on the west side).  
; Today's scene is located in a converging arm covering a ghost 
; bud in this strange but interesting east end.
; 
; As I stated above, there is no obvious midget at the center of 
; today's image.  But this does not mean there are no midgets in 
; the scene.  There are, in fact, the usual infinity of midgets 
; lurking unseen within the fractal creature with the stinging 
; tentacles.  And to prove my point, I will present one of them as 
; the FOTD for tomorrow.
; 
; The image calculates in only 3 minutes, fast enough for the 
; busiest fractal fans.  For extra convenience, the finished image 
; is posted for quick viewing on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; An absolutely gorgeous day here at Fractal Central on Wednesday 
; was ignored by the fractal cats, who appear destined to spend 
; their entire lives safely indoors.  But the bright sunshine and 
; temperature of 50F 10C made the humans in the area quite happy.  
; Being human, I appreciated the fine weather, but I was kept busy 
; enough that I had little time to take advantage of it.  The next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and seek 
; to find.
