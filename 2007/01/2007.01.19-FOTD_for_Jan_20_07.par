; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image could be considered the halfway point on the quest 
; for a great fractal.  I stopped halfway because of the very busy 
; day on Friday, which left little time for fractals.
; 
; The image is a scene in the southern branch of Seahorse Valley 
; of the parent Mandelbrot set that results when 0.6 parts of 
; Z^(-1.5) are combined with 0.6 parts of Z^(+1.5) and straight C 
; is added.
; 
; Perhaps I should not say the image is a scene in Seahorse Val-
; ley.  The image is a cross section of the center part of the 
; entire valley.  There is no midget M-set lurking boldly at the 
; center, (though plenty midgets are likely lurking in the purple 
; chaos along the upper and lower edges of the frame).
; 
; In keeping with the trend lately, I gave the image no name or 
; rating.  The reason is that I had no time to do a proper search, 
; and had to settle for a picture of the valley itself.
; 
; The chief attraction in the picture is the curious features scat-
; tered through the center of the valley.  Midgets might lie deep 
; in these features, but I rather suspect that the features, in 
; typical fractal style, go on forever with little or no change.  
; One might call such features Cantor dust.
; 
; The render time of 14-3/4 minutes is slow for an image of such 
; mediocre worth.  But relief for fractal indigestion is at hand 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the pre-rendered image is or soon will be posted.
; 
; Partly cloudy, cold and blustery weather here at Fractal Central 
; on Friday, with occasional squalls of snow and a temperature of 
; 32F 0C, did not worry the fractal cats, who passed the day play-
; ing and keeping warm.  When the time for their treat arrived, 
; they were worn out and ready to enjoy their food.
; 
; As expected, my day was very busy, and the next week or so will 
; be the same.  The next FOTD will most likely appear in 24 hours. 
; If it doesn't make it, you'll know the rush has turned out to be 
; worse than anticipated.  Until then, take care, and keep alert 
; for new fractals.
