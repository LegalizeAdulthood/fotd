; FOTD -- January 22, 2007 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; A very busy day leaves little time for discussion.
; 
; Today's unrated image is named "Eight Block Square".  I gave it 
; this name when I noticed the eight blocky, black areas surround-
; ing the compulsory midget at the center.
; 
; The parent fractal was created by iterating a formula combining 
; a little Z^(-25) with a little more Z^(2.5), then adding C.  This 
; parent is a most unusual fractal, basically a crescent ox-bow 
; lake.  Today's image was found at the edge of a large flat disk 
; filling the center of the parent.
; 
; The image consists of partially inside and partially outside 
; 'stuff'.  I added interest by calculating it with the outside 
; set to 'tdis' and the inside set to 'fmod'.  These options 
; appear to give the best image.
; 
; The render time of 2-3/4 minutes is brief enough, but it may be 
; reduced to zero by going to the FOTD web site at"
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; Sunday turned cloudy and colder here at Fractal Central.  The 
; temperature reached only 25F -4C, but this did not deter the 
; fractal cats from having fun indoors.  By the time their evening 
; treat was served, they were totally tired out and ready to 
; settle down to eat.
; 
; My day was very busy, and from the looks of things, the next 3 
; or 4 days will be even busier.  I cannot guarantee that an 
; unbroken series of FOTD's will appear, but I'll do my best.  As 
; of this evening, I give the Jan 23 to the Jan 26 FOTD's a 50-
; percent chance of appearing.  Check back to see how right I am.  
; Until next time, take care, and help save the fractals.  Give 
; to the fractal iteration fund.
