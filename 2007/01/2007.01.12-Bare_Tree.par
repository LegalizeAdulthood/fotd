; FOTD -- January 13, 2006 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a virtual tree I stumbled upon in the 
; fractal that results when 0.5 part of Z^(-4.5) is subtracted 
; from 5 parts of Z^(-1.4) and (1/C) is added.
; 
; The parent fractal resembles a Mandelbrot set that is rotated 
; about 180 degrees and located a bit too close to the bailout 
; radius.  Today's image is found on the southwest shoreline of 
; the main bay, which is on the west side of the parent fractal.
; 
; The resemblance to a tree in winter, with the branches covered 
; in ice, is so striking that no other name but "Bare Tree" would 
; be satisfactory.  All in all, the image is worth a rating of a 
; lofty 8, at least in my opinion.
; 
; One of the best features of the image is its super speed.  The 
; calculation finishes in a matter of 34 seconds even on my slow 
; old 200mhz machine.  And the image is or soon will be posted on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Friday began with light rain here at Fractal Central.  By 9am 
; the rain ended, leading to a mostly cloudy day with a tempera-
; ture of 46F 8C.  For some reason the fractal cats seemed annoyed 
; most of the day, and spent a good part of the time sulking.  
; Their good spirits didn't return until they had finished their 
; evening treats.
; 
; My day was totally uneventful.  What more could one ask for?  
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and don't get haunted by the spirit of a lost fractal.
