; FOTD -- January 16, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's rather unusual image is a partially evaporated scene in 
; the fractal that results when 5 parts of Z^(-1.4) are combined 
; with 0.5 part of Z^(-4,5) and (1/C) is added.  This parent 
; fractal is a roughly circular thing filled with scattered 
; fractal debris.  Today's image is located near the end of a 
; twisting strand of disconnected debris on the east side of the 
; circular parent.
; 
; The bailout radius of 20100 assures that the parent fractal is 
; partially evaporated.  The remaining unevaporated 'outside' 
; stuff was colored with the 'tdis' option, which creates the 
; effect of strings of beads.  The 'inside' parts were colored 
; with the 'bof61' option, which supplies the solid, unbroken 
; background.
; 
; A midget does lie at the center of today's image.  It is virtu-
; ally impossible to distinguish amid all the other fractal 
; goodies however.  I did not get around to naming the image, 
; though I did rate it at a hasty 7.  The render time of under 
; 3-1/2 minutes can probably be bettered by going to the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the already-rendered image from there.
; 
; Occasional light rain and only slightly milder temperatures 
; prevailed here at Fractal Central on Monday.  The high 
; temperature of 52F 11C actually came after nightfall, just 
; around the time the fractal cats were enjoying their evening 
; treats.  
; 
; My day was busier than expected, making today's fractal all the 
; more unusual.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and be at peace with the universe of fractals.
