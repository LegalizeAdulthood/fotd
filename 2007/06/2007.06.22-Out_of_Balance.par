; FOTD -- June 22, 2007 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With its inadequate coloring, yesterday's FOTD showed what can 
; go wrong with an evaporated fractal.  Today's image is another 
; evaporated one, but this time I put far more effort into the 
; coloring, and the extra work has paid off.
; 
; The image lies in the parent fractal that results when 2.72 
; parts of Z^(-2.7) are subtracted from 8.5 parts of Z^(-1.6).  
; This parent is an oversized Mandeloid with X-axis symmetry, 
; which has been rotated 180 degrees.  It has a surprisingly large 
; ring at the end of its main stem and an extra circular bay where 
; its East Valley should be.  Today's image lies on the northern 
; shoreline of this extra bay.
; 
; As the bailout radius of one-googol shows, the image has been 
; totally evaporated, and the residue made visible by the 'bof61' 
; inside fill, the fill that almost always works best with evap-
; orated images.  And yes, there is a quadratic midget at the 
; center of the image, but, being inside stuff surrounded by more 
; inside stuff, it has almost vanished.
; 
; I rated the image at an 8 because it actually seems to picture a 
; real (meaning a 3-D onjective) object.  I named the image "Out 
; of Balance", though in this case it is not life that is out of 
; balance, it is the elements of the image.
; 
; The calculation time of under 3 minutes is not too bad, but an 
; even better choice is to view the finished image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A mostly sunny, breezy and rather warm day here at Fractal 
; Central on Thursday, with a high temperature of 84F 29C went un-
; noticed by the cats, who were more interested in watching for 
; the baby rabbits that have been hopping around the yard, eating 
; Fractal Lady's flowers.  When the rabbits never showed up, the 
; cats eventually lost patience and fell asleep.  It thundered in 
; the evening, but the rain never arrived.
; 
; My day was about average.  But tomorrow I plan on a trip back to 
; Old Fractal Central to say hello to the old fractal cats, Thomas 
; and Tippy, and pick up some more things I left there.  I'll try 
; to post the FOTD for June 23 on schedule, but there is no guar-
; antee.  Until next time, take care, and how does one recognize 
; the real reality when he meets it?
