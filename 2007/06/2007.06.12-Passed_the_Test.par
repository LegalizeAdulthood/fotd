; FOTD -- June 12, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image we return to the parent fractal that held the 
; 'Fractal Ringers' image of 4 days ago.  In fact, we return to 
; the same general area that held the previous scene.  This time 
; we check the larger valley just to the north of the tiny valley 
; that comes from and goes nowhere.
; 
; I named today's image "Passed the Test".  I have totally 
; forgotten why I gave it this name, but it really doesn't matter. 
; The viewer can invent a connection between image and name.
; 
; The rating of a 6 seems appropriate, considering that I did put 
; near a half-hour into tweaking the coloring and trying different 
; inside fills.  It turned out that the 'bof61' inside fill works 
; best -- it usually does.
; 
; The included parameter file takes 2-1/2 minutes on the P2000 
; computer and 12 minutes on the P200.  (The P2000 is only 5 times 
; as fast with Fractint as the P200.)  I might check to see how 
; fast Fractint runs on an older P3 unit.  I hear that those CPU's 
; were faster with 16-bit applications.
; 
; Of course, all this concern about calculating speed can be 
; forgotten if the completed image is viewed on the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Absolutely perfect weather prevailed once again here at Fractal 
; Central on Monday, with blue skies, billowing white clouds and a 
; temperature of 82F 28C.  At 7pm a lonely little sunshine shower 
; passed over, doing more good than harm as it settled the dust.
; 
; The work was a bit too heavy for me to enjoy the perfection 
; however, but the fractal cats made the most of it.  If all goes 
; as planned, tomorrow will be another perfect day.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  It's a good one, so 
; don't miss it.  It's a real 9.5-rated image.  In the meantime, 
; take care, and don't dare.
