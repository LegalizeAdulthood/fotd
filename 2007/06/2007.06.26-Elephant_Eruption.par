; FOTD -- June 26, 2007 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the East Valley area of the 
; Mandelbrot set.  Or more accurately, it is a scene in the area 
; of the four-dimensional Julibrot fractal that corresponds to 
; East Valley.
; 
; The Julibrot fractal is the 4-D object that would be formed if 
; all the Julia sets were stacked into a single pile. Curiously, 
; the same 4-D object would be formed if all the perturbed 
; Mandelbrot sets were stacked into a single pile, though the 
; object would be oriented in a totally perpendicular direction.
; 
; Actually, the direction of today's slice is closer to the Julia 
; orientation than the Mandelbrot orientation.  It is rotated from 
; the Julia direction in only two of the four possible directions, 
; one rotation of 20 degrees and one of 60 degrees.
; 
; The East Valley area of the Mandelbrot set is known as Elephant 
; Valley for a good reason.  It is filled with elephants -- an 
; endless parade of them marching out of the valley, circling the 
; main bay, and finally losing their identity completely as they 
; near the large north and south period-3 buds.
; 
; Curiously, the elephants are not to be found in the Julia sets 
; of that area, but they do exist in most of the odd-direction 
; slices between the Mandelbrot and Julia directions.
; 
; In today's picture we see 4 proto-elephants.  The third from the 
; right is the best formed, but even this one leaves much to be 
; desired.  To the left of the best elephant is a tall skinny 
; fragmentary one, and at the left edge of the frame is a bit of a 
; trunk without an elephant attached.  At the right edge of the 
; frame is a hump that looks like the rump of a large elephant.  
; Actually, this is only a hump.   No head or trunk exists beyond 
; the right edge of the screen.
; 
; I named the image "Elephant Eruption", since the elephants kind 
; of seem to be appearing out of nowhere.  When it came time to 
; rate the image, I could give it a rating no better than a 
; miserable 3.  It takes more than some twisted elephant parts to 
; make a good fractal.  Hey, I can't help it if I like elephants!
; 
; The calculation time of 4-2/3 minutes is true on the fast P2000 
; machine.  On the slow old P200 unit, the image would take around 
; 23 minutes to finish.  But calculation time will be no problem 
; for those who visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the completed image there.
; 
; Monday here at Fractal Central was a little too hazy, warm and 
; humid for weather perfection, but the fractal cats enjoyed the 
; temperature of 84F 29C anyway.  And the commercial work was slow 
; enough for me to enjoy the fractal elephants.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in all its glory in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and maybe fractals are real, while we are not.
