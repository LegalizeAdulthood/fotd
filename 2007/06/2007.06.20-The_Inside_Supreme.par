; FOTD -- June 21, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's either the longest day of the year, the shortest day of the 
; year, or just another day exactly 12 hours long, depending on 
; where on earth one lives.  Here at Fractal Central, it's the 
; longest day.  The sun rises at 5:36am and sets at 8:42pm EDT, 
; though the twilight begins shortly after 4am and lingers until 
; 10pm.
; 
; On the longest day of the year, it's only proper that the FOTD 
; should be above average.  And I think I have posted an above-
; average one.  It's an evaporated scene in the parent fractal 
; that results when 5.5 negative parts of Z^(-1.5) are combined 
; with 0.5 negative part of Z^(-5.5) and (1/C) is added.  An 
; evaporated fractal is one in which all the exponents of Z are 
; negative and which has such a large bailout radius that all the 
; points are trapped.  These fractals must be calculated with an 
; active inside fill such as 'bof61' to avoid a totally flat blank 
; screen.
; 
; The drawback to evaporated fractals is their slowness.  They are 
; slow because they consist totally of 'inside' stuff.  In today's 
; case, the parameter file takes 24 minutes to calculate on the 
; fast 2000 mhz machine.  On the old 200 mhz work horse, it would 
; take 2-1/2 hours or more.  But I have sent the calculated image 
; on ahead to Paul at the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it will soon be posted for instant enjoyment.
; 
; I named today's image "The Inside Supreme" because it's all 
; inside.  I rated it at a 7 because that's what I think it's 
; worth.  If I had put more effort into the colors, I might have 
; been able to rate it at an 8.
; 
; Wednesday was absolutely perfect here at Fractal Central.  Every 
; aspect of the weather was in the middle of the comfort range.  
; The fractal cats celebrated the perfection by finding a strong 
; shaft of sunlight and resting in it until it moved out of reach.
; 
; In my department, the commercial work was about average, but I 
; had an exceptionally efficient day, and finished in notably less 
; time than usual.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and don't be haunted by fractal entities.
