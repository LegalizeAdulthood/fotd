; FOTD -- June 09, 2007 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's FOTD fractal we have a picture of a midget.  But 
; this is not just any old midget.  It is a midget in the fractal 
; that results when the nearly-linear formula (-Z)^(1.09)+C is 
; calculated.  This parent fractal has X-axis symmetry as well as 
; an overall resemblance to a Mandelbrot set with all its bays but 
; the large period-2 bay missing.
; 
; Today's scene is located in the chaos that lines the north 
; shoreline of the parent fractal.  Midgets are very hard to find 
; in fractals of such a low order, so I was very lucky to find the 
; little fellow.  I was so lucky in fact that I decided to grant 
; the image the honor of being FOTD for a day.  With its many 
; intricacies, the midget really is interesting, and unexpectedly 
; attractive as well.
; 
; I named the picture "Nearly Linear", referring to the exponent 
; of Z, which is quite close to unity.  Then I rated it at an 8 to 
; reward myself for the extra effort I put into the coloring.  The 
; calculation time of 4 minutes on the P2000 would be increased to 
; around 20 minutes on the P200.
; 
; The calculation time becomes irrelevant however when the pre-
; calculated image is viewed on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Far too much heat here at Fractal Central on Friday made things 
; unpleasant for those who had to be outdoors.  High humidity and 
; a temperature of 93F 34C isn't in the comfort range.  The cats, 
; who never go outside, paid no attention to the heat.  They were 
; happy taking it easy all afternoon on their scratching posts.  
; By the time a cooling thunder-shower moved in at 9pm, they were 
; asleep.
; 
; My day was moderately busy.  Tomorrow will likely be slower.  If 
; it is, the next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  If not, the FOTD 
; might take 25 hours.  Until then, take care, and be at ease with 
; things as they are.
