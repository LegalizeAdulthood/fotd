; FOTD -- June 05, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I did it!  And it wasn't that hard.  I found what I consider a 
; worthwhile midget of order 1.5.  I found it in the Mandeloid 
; that results when the formula Z^(1.5)+C is iterated 115 levels 
; up the complex logarithmic ladder to infinity.
; 
; This parent fractal consists of a large bay with two large and 
; nearly equal buds.  Today's scene is located in the outer chaos 
; around one of these buds.
; 
; When compared to some of the quadratic midgets I have come upon 
; over the years, today's little fellow is not all that great, but 
; I like its symmetry and the way it hides its necessary disconti-
; nuities.
; 
; I named the image "Is This Success?", and I rated it at a 7.  
; The calculation time of a measly 3-1/4 minutes on the P2000 is 
; well within reason.  And the fully rendered image is or soon 
; will be posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it may effortlessly be viewed and hopefully enjoyed.
; 
; Morning clouds and drizzle gave way to afternoon sunshine and a 
; temperature of 79F 26C here at Fractal Central on Monday.  The 
; day ended with a cooling thunder-shower.  The fractal cats spent 
; most of the day curled comfortably on their scratching posts, 
; paying no attention at all to the weather.
; 
; My day was rather busy but not excessively so.  And I actually 
; felt a bit happy when I found the 7-rated midget in a Z^(1.5)+C 
; Mandeloid.  With this goal accomplished, it's time to move on.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and if we exist in an infinity of alternate worlds, are the 
; other versions of ourselves conscious?  If they are conscious, 
; then they are not really us, they are someone else who looks 
; like us, because we can be in only one place at a time.  And if 
; they are not conscious, then they are not actual people at all.  
; And if some animated human bodies in alternate worlds are not 
; actually conscious people, how many animated bodies in this 
; alternate world may not be conscious people?  We really must 
; solve the riddle of what makes us our unique selves, though I 
; doubt that our present method of science can find the answer or 
; that an effort will even be made to find it.
