; FOTD -- June 01, 2007 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's a new month here at Fractal Central, where our job is to 
; try to make silk purses out of the sow's ears some customers 
; send in.  Sometimes we succeed, sometimes not.  In today's image 
; I have tried once again to make something of nothing.
; 
; The nothing is the midgets I have so far found in the Mandeloids 
; between 1 and 2; the something would be to actually find a 
; really great midget in one of these fractals.  Today I tried, 
; with only a bit of success, to make something of a tiny midget I 
; found in the debris on the northern side of the main bay of the 
; parent fractal that is generated when the formula Z^(1.5)+C is 
; reiterated 439-1/2 levels down the infinite complex logarithmic 
; ladder.
; 
; What I got was just another bunch of broken filaments converging 
; on a tiny midget in the center, which is so small that it might 
; as well be invisible.  By working on the coloring a bit I was 
; able to rate the whole thing at a 5.  But by FOTD standards, any 
; rating below a 6 is unacceptable.  I named the image "Searching 
; for Silk", which was what I was doing when I stumbled upon the 
; midget.
; 
; Am I ready to give up the so-far-fruitless search?  No way!  But 
; I will confine my efforts to the Z^(1.5)+C fractals until I find 
; something worth the effort.  In fact, I already have an idea for 
; tomorrow's FOTD.
; 
; Today's image is lightning fast.  It calculates in under one 
; minute.  And just as fast and even more convenient is going to 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the completed image there.
; 
; Let's face it, the weather has been a bit too perfect here at 
; Fractal Central these past several weeks.  True, the sunshine 
; was plentiful on Thursday, but the high temperature of 91F 33C 
; and noticeable humidity were just too oppressive to be called 
; perfect, and the lack of rain is causing real concern among the 
; area farmers.
; 
; The fractal cats only concern was the noise from the road work 
; 1/2 block up the street.  But even that minor annoyance went 
; away when the workers quit for the day at 5pm.
; 
; As for me, the day was acceptable, neither great nor terrible, 
; but simply acceptable.  The next FOTD fractal will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and when measuring the volume of 
; a theoretically perfect vacuum, exactly what are we measuring?  
; In other words, how can there be more or less of nothing?
