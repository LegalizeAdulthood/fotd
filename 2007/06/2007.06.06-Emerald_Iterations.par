; FOTD -- June 07, 2007 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image really turned out well, so well in fact that I 
; rated it at a lofty 9.  The parent fractal, which was created by 
; combining 2 negative parts of Z^(1.5) with 2 positive parts of 
; Z^(2.5) and adding straight C, is a distortion of the Mandelbrot 
; set, with many extra bays and other goodies to explore.  Today's 
; image is located in one of these extra goodies -- a tiny, almost 
; invisible valley that sprouts from nowhere and goes nowhere.
; 
; This tiny valley is located just outside of the much larger 
; seahorse-type valley that sets off the period-2 bud on the north-
; west shoreline of the main bay.  (There is a second period-2 bud 
; and a second tiny valley on the symmetrical southwest shoreline.)
; 
; The image is made by its coloring, which is a refreshing change 
; from the usual and often too-intense colors of most FOTD images. 
; I named the image "Emerald Iterations".  The green is not quite 
; pure, but it is green enough to justify its name.
; 
; The calculation time of 3-1/2 minutes on the P2000 machine would 
; be extended to around 15 minutes on the P200 machine.  It will 
; be cut to seconds however by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the completed image there.
; 
; The weather here at Fractal Central on Wednesday was absolutely 
; perfect.  The deep blue sky, puffy white clouds, low humidity, 
; light winds and high temperature of 70F 21C could hardly be 
; improved upon.  The cats made no effort to improve upon the 
; weather.  They were too busy watching a pair of doves.
; 
; With a 9-rated FOTD to boast about, and the commercial work well 
; under control, my day was well above average.  Now if only 
; tomorrow could be a repeat . . .  Regardless, the next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and grasp at the 
; great mysteries.
