; FOTD -- August 14, 2007 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates only a 5, mostly because we've seen several 
; other images like it over the past several days.  And I think 
; this is the third time that I have used the same color palette 
; with only slight changes.
; 
; The parent fractal was created when 12 parts of Z^(1.02) were 
; subtracted from 12 parts of Z^(0.98) and straight C was added.  
; This parent is a Mandeloid rotated 180 degrees.  We have seen 
; quite a few of this type of parent recently, which is another 
; reason why today's image rates only a 5.
; 
; Today's image is located in the East Valley area of a large 
; quadratic Mandelbrot midget in the chaos on the northwest side 
; of the main bay of the parent fractal.  I named the image 
; "Attack of Fraczilla", mostly in honor of Godzilla, who is still 
; my favorite rampaging movie monster.  I seem to see a bit of a 
; fractal rampage stirring in the image, which inspired the 
; connection to the king of monsters.
; 
; There is nothing monstrous about the calculation time of 1-1/2 
; minutes however.  Such a brief time makes running the included 
; parameter file almost a pleasure.  An equally pleasing experi-
; ence is to visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and see the finished GIF image there.
; 
; The only greater pleasure I can think of would be to have a 
; fully functional version of Fractint for Windows-XP loaded on my 
; P4-2000mhz machine, with the ability to use arbitrary precision 
; math with type=formula fractals.
; 
; The Monday weather turned out as near perfect as is ever seen 
; here at Fractal Central.  If an increased amount of bad weather 
; is a sign of global warming, we have nothing to worry about here 
; in Pennsylvania.  Unfortunately, near perfect means no excite-
; ment, and a continued lack of excitement would soon turn boring. 
; The fractal cats agreed, stretched, and went to sleep.
; 
; My day was well under control.  Tuesday should be the same.  The 
; next FOTD is due to appear on Tuesday evening, around 24 hours 
; from now.  Until then, take care, and maybe the trendy overhyped 
; global warming disasters will bypass Fractal Central.
