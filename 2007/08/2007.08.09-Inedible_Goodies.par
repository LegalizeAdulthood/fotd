; FOTD -- August 09, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The generating formula of today's image subtracts 12 parts of 
; Z^(1.11) from 12 parts of Z^(1.1) then adds straight C.  The 
; parent fractal generated by this formula is rather difficult to 
; find.  The default screen is totally black.  A single outzoom 
; reveals a circular black hole in a blue background.  Only when 
; the bailout radius is increased to a very large value, such as 
; today's 100000000, and another outzoom is done, does the com-
; plete parent come into view.
; 
; When this parent fractal is finally found, it roughly resembles 
; the Mandeloid produced by the formula (-Z)^(1.1)+C, when it has 
; been rotated 180 degrees.  This parent has X-axis symmetry, 
; which is interesting, but the most unusual thing about it is an 
; obvious midget deep in the chaos on the northwest (and south-
; west) shores of the main bay.
; 
; This midget is quite unusual.  At first glance it appears to be 
; non-critical, but a closer examination shows that it contains 
; critically perfect sub-midgets.  Today's scene is located deep 
; in what appears to be an East Valley of the strange midget.
; 
; I named the image "Inedible Goodies".  Fractals might be 'good', 
; but they are definitely inedible.  I rated it at a 6.  There is 
; something about the coloring that leaves me unsatisfied.
; 
; The calculation time of 5-3/4 minutes is fast enough to prevent 
; boredom.  The image may also be seen on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A heavy thunder storm Tuesday night did not leave things any 
; cooler here at Fractal Central on Wednesday morning.  The day's 
; high temperature of 95F 35C made outdoor life unpleasant for 
; both man and cat.  And speaking of cats, the fractal ones kept 
; themselves cool under the air conditioner.  Nicholas took a few 
; nibbles at the tray of fresh green cat-grass, then returned to 
; stretch out in the cool draft.
; 
; My day was acceptable.  The day's fractal could have been a 
; little better, but you can't have everything.  The next FOTD is 
; scheduled in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and don't get 
; fractal indigestion.
