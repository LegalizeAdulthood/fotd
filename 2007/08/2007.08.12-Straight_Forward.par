; FOTD -- August 12, 2007 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's nice to escape the endless spirals that fill so many 
; fractals.  In today's image we escape them with a vengeance.  
; There are no spirals in today's image.  In fact there are no 
; curved elements at all.  Some of the elements do have jagged 
; edges, but the overall shapes radiate from the central midget 
; straight as an arrow.  In recognition of all this straightness, 
; I named today's image "Straight Forward".
; 
; While I was coloring the image, I had an attack of serendipity.  
; The colors flashed onto the screen ready-to-go, complete with 
; the bright white band.  I needed to tweak only about 10 color 
; registers to create today's outstandingly moody color palette.
; 
; The colors are what raises the rating to a superior 9.  And it 
; is an honest 9, not a typing error like the 9 I typed by mistake 
; three days ago, when the image actually rated only a 6.
; 
; In today's formula I subtracted 20 parts of Z^(1.01) from 20 
; parts of Z^(0.99) and added C.  The 20 parts are necessary 
; because the actual difference between the two exponents is so 
; small that nothing but a blank screen is produced unless the 
; difference is magnified.  And even with the difference magnified 
; 20 times, the parent fractal is grossly oversized, making the 
; excessive escape radius of 1000 still necessary.
; 
; The parent fractal is another Mandeloid rotated 180 degrees, 
; similar to the parent fractals of the past several fractal 
; images.  Today's scene is located at the extreme western edge of 
; the chaos, very close to the X-axis.  The mathtolerance entry is 
; necessary to assure that the image generates from the parameter 
; file at the correct magnitude.
; 
; I was sorely tempted to position the midget away from the center 
; of the frame, somewhere near one of the upper 1/3-1/3 points, 
; which would have added additional tension to the scene.  If the 
; purpose of the image were artistic, I would have done so, but 
; the FOTD images are for mathematical interest rather than an ex-
; hibition of art, so I kept the midget centered and in the normal 
; orientation.  There is no rule stating that midgets must always 
; be centered however.  I might start adding tension to future 
; images by eliminating the all-too-common symmetry around the 
; center of the frame.
; 
; At just over 1 minute, the calculation time of today's image is 
; quite short.  And considering the rating of a 9, it is quite a 
; bargain.  It's also a bargain to see the image already rendered 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather was perfect here at Fractal Central on Saturday, 
; a day that would make any outdoor activity a pleasure.  The 
; fractal cats' day was near perfect; the FOTD fractal is near 
; perfect, and the commercial work is totally under control.  I 
; don't want to tempt fate by saying that everything was totally 
; perfect all day, but it came close.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear on schedule in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and keep alert.
