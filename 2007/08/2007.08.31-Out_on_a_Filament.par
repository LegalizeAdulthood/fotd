; FOTD -- August 31, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the tip of the negative spike of the 
; Mandelbrot set, where we examine a tiny minibrot.  In fact, it 
; is the most remote minibrot on the spike reachable with conven-
; tional math.  But where is the minibrot?
; 
; Actually, it is very close.  The problem is that we have 
; perturbed the view, and therefore have just missed the minibrot. 
; But we have come close enough to skim through the outer fringes 
; of the pattern around it.  To see the actual unperturbed mini-
; brot simply reset the real and imaginary p2 parameters to zero 
; and shift the view a bit.
; 
; I have added to the interest by reducing the bailout radius, 
; which is real(p4), to the point where the entire scene is on the 
; verge of being swallowed up entirely.  I have added even more 
; interest by rendering the image with the outside set to 'tdis'.
; 
; I named the image "Out on a Filament", since that is its 
; location.  But the rating of a 6 was all I could do for an image 
; that is basically just another trip to the over-viewed negative 
; spike of the Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The calculation time of a sizzling 39 seconds will try the 
; patience of no one.  And the task of calculating the scene may 
; be done away with entirely by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.
; 
; As I write this, I wonder what this Mandelbrot-set location 
; would look like in some of the odd orientations through the 
; Julibrot.  Well, there is one way to find out, and that is to go 
; and look.  If I find anything of exceptional interest, it will 
; appear as a future FOTD.
; 
; The weather was too warm for comfort here at Fractal Central on 
; Thursday, with a high temperature of 90F 32C and quite sticky 
; humidity.  In the evening however a light thunder-shower cooled 
; things down a bit.  The fractal cats don't worry themselves with 
; outside heat unless there are squirrels to go along with it.  If 
; there are no squirrels, a chipmunk or two will do.
; 
; My day was appropriately busy and tomorrow promises to be the 
; same.  The next FOTD is due in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and give particular attention to the questions that appear to 
; have no answers.
