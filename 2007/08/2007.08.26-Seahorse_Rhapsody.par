; FOTD -- August 26, 2007 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; When one needs an acceptable fractal in a hurry, what better 
; place to search than Seahorse Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  And 
; I didn't have to search long to find today's scene, which lies 
; at only a moderate depth on the west side of the valley.
; 
; A fractal that comes almost automatically, as today's did, can 
; hardly be rated above average, so I gave it a rating of an 
; average 5.
; 
; I named the image "Seahorse Rhapsody" when the bluish cast of an 
; earlier version reminded me of the 'Rhapsody in Blue'.  I have 
; since toned down the blueness, but the name remains.
; 
; Perhaps the best feature of today's fractal is its very brief 
; calculation time, which is only 24 seconds on the P4-2000.  The 
; image would finish in about 3 minutes even on the tired old P200.
; 
; But why bother at all with calculating parameter files when the 
; image is posted, already rendered, on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; With a high temperature of 97F 36C, Saturday was the hottest day 
; in several weeks here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats, 
; whose ancestors lived in northern Africa, where it is even 
; hotter, didn't mind the heat, but they would have liked a few 
; more crickets to play with.  My day was kept busy with a trip to 
; State College, but it was still enjoyable.  The next FOTD is due 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and I wonder what wonders 
; are yet to be found in Fractaland, wherever it is located.
