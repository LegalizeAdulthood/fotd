; FOTD -- August 08, 2007 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's image "Final Parent Image".  This name is not 
; exactly correct however, for the parent fractal of today's image 
; is not the same one that appeared as the FOTD of July 31, 2007, 
; and which I have been using for a week as the source of the FOTD 
; images.  To create today's parent I changed the Z^(-1.05) of the 
; old parent to Z^(-1.04).
; 
; This tiny change makes a huge difference in the appearance of 
; the resulting parent fractal.  The overall characteristics, such 
; as the Mandeloid with no East Valley, and the multitude of 
; terminating rings, remain pretty much the same, but the size 
; grows to grotesque proportions.  Today's image is located very 
; near the western extremity of this humongous parent.
; 
; The image has kind of a pop-art effect, with contrasting areas 
; of nearly flat color filling the screen.  If the image is 
; rendered with the outside set to 'tdis', a more traditional 
; effect will result, which is a bit too busy for my taste.  Evapo-
; rating the image works only with the 'bof61' inside fill, when 
; it merely reproduces the pop-art effect.
; 
; After not-too-careful consideration, I decided to rate the image 
; at an 8.  It might not be worth every bit of this rating, but I 
; rather like the posterized effect, so in my opinion the rating 
; is justified.
; 
; The calculation time of 5-1/2 minutes is little enough price to 
; pay for the pleasure of watching the image come to life.  This 
; pleasure may be bypassed however by visiting the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the parameter file has already been calculated and the 
; image posted for immediate viewing.
; 
; Tuesday was quite warm and very humid here at Fractal Central, 
; with a high temperature of 90F 32C, but clouds and a breeze kept 
; things from becoming stifling.  The light rain that arrived in 
; the evening made the night even more humid.
; 
; The F.C. cats spent most of the day sleeping, while I spent most 
; all day on a small but complicated job.  The next FOTD is due in 
; 24 hours.  Whether it actually appears is still only a likely 
; probability.  Until next time, take care, seek mysteries, then 
; try to solve them.
