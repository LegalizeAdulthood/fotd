; FOTD -- August 05, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Once again we stay in the parent fractal of July 31, and return 
; to the spurious bud where an East Valley of the Mandeloid should 
; be.
; 
; Today's image is half evaporated, which is why I named it "Point 
; of Evaporation".  When the bailout radius is raised, the outside 
; parts of images made with two negative exponents of Z will 
; eventually start to break up, the pieces will shrink, and 
; finally vanish entirely.  Sometimes the evaporation takes the 
; form of a boundary, which spreads through the entire fractal as 
; the bailout is raised, gradually erasing the outside parts until 
; the entire fractal is gone.  At the scene of today's image, both 
; forms of evaporation are taking place.  The image in a sense has 
; been 'photographed' at the moment the evaporation boundary, 
; which is expanding from the top down, has come to intersect the 
; nearly invisible midget at the center.
; 
; The top half of the image has reached an advanced stage of 
; evaporation, and consists of rapidly shrinking bits and pieces 
; of outside stuff.  In the bottom half, the outside stuff is 
; still pretty much intact, though the equal-iteration bands 
; have radically changed shape.  Curiously, if the inside fill is 
; changed from 'atan' to 'bof61', the split across the middle of 
; the image will totally vanish, and the top half of the image 
; will perfectly match the bottom half.
; 
; After some study, I decided to rate today's image at a 7.  Most 
; of the rating is due to the mathematical interest.  The artistic 
; part could use more work.
; 
; The calculation time of just over one minute must come as a 
; pleasant surprise for such a complicated image.  Another 
; pleasant surprise waits on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the completed image is posted for viewing.
; 
; Unusual heat once again made Fractal Central uncomfortable on 
; Saturday, when the afternoon temperature reached 95F 35C.  The 
; humidity was lower than on recent days, but with such a 
; temperature, it makes little difference.  The fractal cats 
; endured the conditions stoically.
; 
; My day away from F.C. was a pleasant break.  The next FOTD is 
; due in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and don't evaporate.
