; FOTD -- August 10, 2007 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image completes what yesterday's image tried to do.  It 
; comes from a parent fractal that closely resembles yesterday's 
; parent.  Today's parent is much smaller however, and has much 
; more chaotic detail surrounding the main bay.  The scene of 
; today's image is at the very western edge of the detail on the 
; southwestern side of the main bay.  And yes, the slight bit of 
; stretching in the horizontal direction is intentional.  It gives 
; the image a better overall composition. 
; 
; The parent fractal was generated when I subtracted 12 parts of 
; Z^(1.02) from 12 parts of Z^(0.98) and added C.  At first glance 
; this parent appears to have even more potential than yester-
; day's.  It has so much potential in fact that I might spend a 
; few more days exploring it.
; 
; I rated today's image at a very superior 9  I am quite satisfied 
; with the neutral color palette, which really brings out the zig-
; zagging features in the foreground.  The name "Infinite Zigging" 
; came about when I pondered the fact that one could dive into the 
; image forever without coming to the end.  How could you come to 
; an end when there is no end?  Of course, the apparent infinity 
; is actually only a half-infinity, for the image is without limit 
; in only one direction.
; 
; An extra bonus is the fireball calculation time of just under 28 
; seconds.  Even on the worn-out old P200 machine, the image would 
; finish in under 3 minutes.  But why bother with calculation when 
; the completed image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it may be viewed and enjoyed at leisure.
; 
; A sunny morning here at Fractal Central on Thursday gave way to 
; a cloudy afternoon, but the rain did not begin until night.  The 
; clouds held the temperature to 84F 29C, though the high humidity 
; still made it feel oppressive.
; 
; The fractal cats had an uneventful day of sleeping and sitting 
; in the window, watching the television show beyond.  Except for 
; the better-than-expected FOTD, my day was uneventful also.  The 
; next in the apparently endless series of FOTD's will appear in 
; 24 hours.  Until then take care, and no one is more surprised 
; than me at how long the FOTD has continued.  When I started it 
; on the Fractal Art list in 1997, I intended to keep it going 
; only a week or two.  It has now become almost a vocation.
