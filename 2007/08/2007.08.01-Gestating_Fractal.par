; FOTD -- August 01, 2007 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; It's rare that I rate a fractal image as high as a 9, but I feel 
; that today's image earns it.  Such brilliant colors are rarely 
; seen in a fractal with a limited 256-color palette.  I actually 
; put over 1/2 hour extra effort into the coloring, which further 
; justifies the rating.
; 
; The image is a scene near the point where the chaos extending 
; from the nose of the Mandeloid in yesterday's 'Parent Fractal' 
; image merges into a terminating ring.  To make things more 
; interesting, I raised the escape radius to the point where the 
; 'outside' stuff is breaking up and the screen is about to become 
; blank.  Then I brought the newly-exposed inside stuff to life 
; with the 'bof61' inside fill.  The 'inside' and 'outside' stuff 
; blends so harmoniously that it is impossible to tell apart.  The 
; escape radius of 1.36769e+023 is quite critical, and it loads 
; correctly from the parameter file.
; 
; I named the image "Gestating Fractal", since I expect quite a 
; few more good images to come from the same parent fractal.  The 
; calculation time of 5 minutes on the P2000 would be only about 
; 1/2 hour on the P200.  The P4 processors do not seem to reach 
; their full speed potential with 16-bit programs such as Fractint.
; 
; As always, the most efficient way of viewing the scene is to 
; visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and instantly see its full glory posted there.
; 
; The next few FOTD's will feature further striking images from 
; the parent fractal of today's image.  When I find a really good 
; fractal like today's parent, I can't let it go with only one 
; image.
; 
; Tuesday was definitely user friendly here at Fractal Central.  
; The sky was a clear blue and the humidity was low.  The only 
; flaw was a slightly too-warm high temperature of 88F 31C, but 
; with such dry air, it cooled off quickly when the sun went down. 
; The fractal cats must have approved -- at least I heard no 
; complaints.
; 
; In my department, the moderate amount of work was finished with 
; plenty time to spare, permitting extra time on today's fractal.  
; The next fractal, hopefully just as good as today's, will appear 
; right here in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and we must hope 
; that something will always prevent backward time travel, so that 
; we can avoid facing those irrational time-travel paradoxes.
