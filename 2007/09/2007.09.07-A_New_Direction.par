; FOTD -- September 07, 2007 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With its texture that reminds me of something I cannot quite pin 
; down, and its lively colors, today's image is unusual enough, at 
; least in my opinion, to rate a 9.  It is found at the northern 
; extremity of the string of large bays in the same parent fractal 
; that gave us yesterday's image.
; 
; I named the image "A New Direction" because its unique texture 
; is something I have never before seen in a fractal.  Actually, 
; nothing should be surprising when it unexpectedly appears in a 
; fractal, since the universe is basically fractal in nature.
; 
; Then again, fractals are basically a creation of the way the 
; human mind organizes the abstractions known as complex numbers, 
; and as such they occupy a strange shadowy realm between real and 
; imaginary.  If one prefers fractals to be real, he can make a 
; print of one and show a picture of it to the world.  If one 
; prefers fractals to be imaginary, he can defy someone to prove 
; they are real by handing him the real Mandelbrot set on a 
; platter.
; 
; To me, fractals are the patterns, ideas if you will, behind the 
; material stuff the universe is made of, and the material itself 
; is as real as the probability waves (fractals?) that make up the 
; atoms.  Since the universe can be no more real than the stuff it 
; is made of, mankind is reduced (or raised) to a minibrot in an 
; infinite fractal.  I'll not broach the question of whether a 
; fractal can be self-conscious.
; 
; But self-conscious or not, today's fractal image calculates in a 
; little over 2 minutes on the fast machine and around 12 minutes 
; on the slow unit.
; 
; As always, the most convenient way to see the image is to go to 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view it there in person.
; 
; Higher humidity and more haze made Thursday's 86F 30C too muggy 
; for comfort here at Fractal Central.  But while the outdoor life 
; was a bit oppressive, the fractal cats made the most of the life 
; indoors by stalking some imaginary creature in the kitchen for 
; most of the afternoon.  Of course, maybe the creature was not 
; imaginary to them!
; 
; Except for the day's fractal, which was well above average, the 
; day turned out about average for me.  The next FOTD will appear 
; in 24 hours.  Until next time, take care, and the world can be 
; considered as real as we want it to be.
