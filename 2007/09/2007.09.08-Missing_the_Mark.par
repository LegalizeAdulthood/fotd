; FOTD -- September 08, 2007 (Rating 3)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a big disappointment.  When I found it, I had 
; great hopes for a third stellar image.  What I ended up with was 
; a boring image the likes of which has been seen countless times 
; before.  Somewhere along the line I missed the mark, which is 
; what I named the image.
; 
; The parent fractal is the same one that supplied the very fine 
; images of the past two days.  I once again found the FOTD in the 
; semi-chaos near the northern end of the chain of large bays, but 
; today's image bears no relation to the previous two days' images.
; 
; In an effort to bring some life to a fractal corpse, I rendered 
; the image whth the outside set to 'real', not that it made much 
; of an improvement.  Before deciding on 'real', I tried the other 
; 'outside' options as well as the 'evaporated' inside options.  
; But these were not even up to the outside=real version I used.
; 
; I was generous when I rated the image at a lowly 3, and consider-
; ing its calculation time of 9 minutes on the fast machine and 
; just under an hour on the slow unit, the image cannot be seen as 
; any kind of a bargain.
; 
; But hey, it's still a fractal, and fractals are what it's all 
; about.  And best of all, the finished image is posted on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it may be viewed at leisure and without effort.
; 
; With a temperature of 90F 32C, haze and high humidity, and other 
; annoyances, Friday was far from perfect here at Fractal Central. 
; The cats slept through most of it, while I was annoyed by an 
; irate customer who sent an e-mail claiming I had sent a job in 
; the wrong format.  I replied that the format I sent is what the 
; supervisor at the customer's print shop said he needed.  An hour 
; later I got an e-mail telling me to ignore the first e-mail.
; 
; We had none of these irritating formatting problems years ago 
; when I worked with a knife and cement on a light table, a job 
; which actually took a bit of skill.  Maybe it's getting close to 
; the time to hang 'em up and concentrate on finding fractals 
; while the rest of mankind reduces itself to a universal plasma 
; of mediocrity for the sake of a bit more convenience.
; 
; The next FOTD will be ready in 24 hours, glorious or not.  Until 
; then, take care, and when you have taken total care, go out and 
; have some fun.
