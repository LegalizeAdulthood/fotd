; FOTD -- September 15, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image continues the thread of the past several days, as 
; we continue onward and upward to an exponent of 6.  The parent 
; fractal is the expected 5-lobed Mandeloid, with today's image 
; located just off the spike of the negative X-axis, very near the 
; point where the spike joins the main body of the parent fractal.
; 
; I named the image "More than Meets an Eye".  In my imagination 
; I see many more things lurking in the depths of the image.  Un-
; fortunately, these are beyond resolution, unless one wishes to 
; shift to arbitrary precision math, which is uselessly slow with 
; the manzpower formula.  To prevent the calculation time from 
; jumping from a lightning-fast 105 seconds to an almost unbeliev-
; ably slow 34 hours, I have included the mathtolerance entry in 
; the parameter file.
; 
; As for the rating, I decided to stick with a rating of 6.  The 
; image is too close to what would be expected to earn more than 
; this.  The calculation time of 1-3/4 minutes is fast enough to 
; prevent the stress of boredom, and in addition, the image is 
; available for instant viewing on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The Friday temperature of 75F 24C was near ideal, but heavy 
; clouds and a threat of rain kept the day from reaching its full 
; potential here at Fractal Central.  The fractal cats did reach 
; their full potential for trouble however, when Cassie somehow 
; worked her way behind a loose panel in the bathroom closet and 
; spent the next hour or so exploring the no-man's land between 
; the floor and ceiling.  She emerged quite dusty but otherwise 
; satisfied with her adventure.
; 
; My day was busy enough to keep boredom at bay.  Tomorrow is 
; still a question, and there will be the next FOTD fractal to 
; contend with.  Until then, take care, and stay alert.
