; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Dry Valley Ambush".  I gave it this name 
; because I was ambushed by it.  Dry valleys are symmetrical 
; features that look like they have a midget at their centers, but 
; when the symmetry is enlarged, it dies out in a flat blank area. 
; A flat blank area is what I found when I eagerly dove into the 
; broad double spiral in today's image, fully expecting to find an 
; unusual midget at its center.
; 
; Due to my disappointment, I rated the image at a lowly 4.  I 
; doubt that it is worth much more.  But with its clashing bright 
; oranges and dark blues, there is a certain mischievousness about 
; it that merits publication.  So I decided to change what should 
; have been an immediate discard into the FOTD for today.
; 
; The parent fractal resulted when I combined 0.01 part of Z^(-77) 
; with 0.01 part of Z^(79) and added (1/C).  This parent is little 
; more than a thin ring of radius 1 centered on the origin, with 
; the fractal stuff lying in the interior of the ring.  At first, 
; the entire ring looks promising, but only the parts of the ring 
; that lie on the X-axis are actually in the critical state.
; 
; Today's scene is located near the point where the ring inter-
; sects the negative X-axis.  Because of the location, I expected 
; more at the center of the spiral in today's image than I found 
; there.  But fractals are unpredictable, and one is sometimes un-
; expectedly surprised or, as in today's case, disappointed.
; 
; At least, the image is a fast one, finishing in 53 seconds on 
; the fast P4-2000mhz machine.  It would take near 5 minutes on 
; the old P200mhz unit.
; 
; The finished image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A slightly chilly but otherwise near perfect day prevailed here 
; at Fractal Central on Saturday.  The fractal cats enjoyed the 
; pigeons scrounging for food on the sidewalk.  I enjoyed having 
; the work caught up, even though the day's fractal left something 
; to be desired.  The next fractal will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and fill in life's blanks with fractals.
