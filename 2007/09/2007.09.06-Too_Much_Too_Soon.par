; FOTD -- September 06, 2007 (Rating 8.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's evaporated image probably sets a new record for FOTD 
; gaudiness.  It lies in the parent fractal that results when 5.5 
; negative parts of Z^(-1.4142) are combined with 1.1 negative 
; parts of Z^(-4) and (1/C) is added.
; 
; This parent fractal is almost beyond belief.  It is a bloated 
; Mandeloid with several large bays and a smoothly curved main 
; spike that terminates at the center of a ring that is larger 
; than the Mandeloid it springs from.  Today's image is found on a 
; side-shoot of the main spike near the point where it ends at the 
; center of the large ring.
; 
; I named the image "Too Much Too Soon" when I couldn't decide 
; what to make of it.  The colors are basically accidental, though 
; I did tweak a few registers to fine tune the palette.  The 
; rating of an 8.5 could easily have been a 9 if the colors had 
; been a bit more organized.
; 
; The calculation time of 75 seconds will offend no one.  Even on 
; an 11-year-old P200mhz unit, the calculation will finish in 
; about 7 minutes.  But on some over-qualified S.O.T.A. machines 
; calculation can become problematical.  In this case, the easiest 
; way to view the image is to visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image is or soon will be posted, and enjoy it there.
; 
; Wednesday here at Fractal Central was a bit too warm and brought 
; a few too many clouds for absolute perfection, but with a 
; temperature of 84F 29C and low humidity, it was close enough.  
; The fractal cats were occupied watching a squirrel gathering 
; material for its winter nest, and paid no attention to the 
; weather.
; 
; My day was kept busy designing a logo to print on a tote bag of 
; a health-care organization.  Oh well, I guess it's a living.  
; The next FOTD image will appear in all its glory in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and go ahead and do it.
