; FOTD -- September 10, 2007 (Rating 8-1/2)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; For today's FOTD I decided to see what I could do with the 
; parent fractal that has been the source of the images for the 
; past several days, some of which have been unexpectedly good.
; 
; To begin, I partially evaporated the parent fractal by raising 
; the bailout radius to 1,000,000,000.  Then I tried the different 
; 'outside' options and found that 'mult' works best on the 
; outside parts.  Next I found that inside=bof61 works best on the 
; inside stuff.  Finally I colored the image with a rather harsh 
; blue and gold palette.
; 
; The result reminds me of a supernova, which is well enough.  But 
; why settle for half-way?  Why not go all the way back to the big 
; bang and make it an even bigger bang?  I did just this, then I 
; named the image "The Biggest Bang".  And with a calculation time 
; of 9-1/2 seconds, it would be hard indeed to get more bang for 
; your buck.  I did not want to rate today's image as high as 
; yesterday's, one of the all-time best, yet I consider it above 
; an 8, so I decided on a rating of 8-1/2.
; 
; While searching for a name, I thought of the theory of 
; inflation, which is the present explanation for the enexpected 
; smoothness of the visible universe, but decided that a big bang 
; was enough.  Besides, I need some headroom if an even better 
; cosmic-origin fractal comes along.
; 
; Actually, no one was there at the real big bang, so anything we 
; decide to say about it must remain an undemonstrated theory, 
; backed by the mathematics of course.  Speaking of numbers, as I 
; watch the way we manipulate them until they prove our theories, 
; I sometimes wonder whether the universe is made of numbers.
; 
; To see the biggest bang take a few seconds to run the included 
; parameter file, or go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the finished GIFimage there.
; 
; Summer heat and humidity continued Sunday here at Fractal 
; Central.  With weakened sun and a temperature of only 86F 30C, 
; it was not as oppressive as Saturday, but it was sultry enough 
; to keep the fractal cats in lazy mode.  My day was once again 
; mostly adequate.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, 
; and make peace with your fractal formulas.  They might be the 
; root of the cosmos
