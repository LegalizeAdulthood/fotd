; FOTD -- September 19, 2007 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's splendid image owes its existence to the 'fmod' feature 
; of Fractint, which creates the effect of overlapping bubbles.
; 
; The parent fractal came about when I combined 100 parts of 
; Z^(-3) with 1/100 part of Z^(2) and added C.  With 10,000 times 
; as much Z^(-3) as Z^(2), one would think the resulting fractal 
; would be little more than the 4-pointed Z^(-3) Mandeloid, but 
; actually it is a hugely enlarged Mandelbrot set, with bits of 
; debris in the center of the main bay as well as in every bud.
; 
; Today's image is located in an elephant trunk in the East Valley 
; area of the parent.  At first glance the central midget appears 
; to be a routine one of this area, but a comparison with the same 
; area of the true M-set will reveal that the pattern around the 
; midget has changed.
; 
; The change was enough to inspire me to a rating of an 8.  The 
; name "Test" was a total accident.  I forgot to name the image, 
; so I went with the default name of all parameter files created 
; by the program.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/4 minutes would be stretched to 
; around 7 minutes on the slower computer.  But regardless of the 
; speed of the parameter file, it is always almost instantaneous 
; to view the finished image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Another perfect day (sunny, 73F 23C) went un-noticed here at 
; Fractal Central on Tuesday.  Of course, if the day was un-
; noticed, then how do I know it was perfect?  That's a question 
; worth pondering.  The fractal cats pondered.  They pondered 
; their food dishes, that is.
; 
; My day was routine in all respects, except for the fractal, 
; which turned out better than I had hoped.  The next fractal will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and fractals are the 
; strangest creatures ever.
