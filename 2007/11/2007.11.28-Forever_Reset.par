; FOTD -- November 28, 2007 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I see in the December 3 issue of Time Magazine that according to 
; science, mankind inherits his good and evil tendencies through 
; his genes and these tendencies manifest as behavior as a result 
; of brain activity.  I haven't thoroughly read the article yet, 
; but I suppose it is another pop-scientific 'love is just a brain 
; chemical' type of article.  It probably reports that when we 
; think or do good things, a certain part of our brain becomes 
; active, and when we think or do evil things, a different part 
; becomes active.
; 
; So far so good, but we did not choose our genes, and our brain 
; activity is beyond our control, so how then can criminals be 
; held responsible for their evil behavior?  In fact, if genes and 
; brain activity are the ultimate source of human behavior, then 
; we should immediately free all criminals.  The poor fellows are 
; innocent, imprisoned for something they had no power to avoid 
; doing.  Their genes and brain activity are responsible for the 
; crimes.
; 
; The preceding conclusion is not to be taken seriously, but it 
; does show how little faith I put in the things that materialis-
; tic 'science' pronounces about human behavior.
; 
; I place much more faith in the reality of fractals however, 
; particularly the Mandelbrot set, an infinitesimal part of which 
; is displayed in today's image.  The scene is on the main spike, 
; a short distance east of the largest minibrot.  The location is 
; in the East Valley area of a larger minibrot in the East Valley 
; area of a larger minibrot . . .  Add about 5 more ever-larger 
; minibrots and you'll get the idea.
; 
; There is a perfect minibrot at the center of today's image.  I 
; have been down there to see it.  But it is about 15 orders of 
; magnitude deeper and not worth the time spent calculating it.  
; The best scenes along the way are in areas where the number of 
; surrounding elements resets itself to two, as it does in today's 
; image.  This resetting repeats quite a few times on the way down 
; to the minibrot, which explains the name I gave the image, 
; "Forever Reset".
; 
; I could not rate a fractal which is just another scene deep on 
; the main spike of the M-set, so I let it go un-rated.
; 
; The calculation time of 6-1/2 minutes is true on the 2000mhz 
; machine.  On the 200mhz unit, it takes 1/2 hour to finish.  So 
; why not avoid the wait and check in at the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the completed image is posted for instant and effortless 
; viewing.
; 
; Fairly seasonal conditions prevailed here at Fractal central on 
; Tuesday.  The fractal cats approved of the temperature of 43F 6C 
; but complained about the clouds that intermittently blocked 
; their warm sunlight.  A treat of tuna and cheese restored their 
; good moods.
; 
; My day was once again busy, and the fractal was once again found 
; too hastily for top quality.  The next in the long line of FOTD 
; fractals will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; keep those brain chemicals under control, or you might turn into 
; a fractal.
