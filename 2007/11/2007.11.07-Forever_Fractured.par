; FOTD -- November 07, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us into the parent fractal created when 
; Z^(-1.1) is mixed with Z^(-2.2) and (1/C) is added.  This 
; somewhat oversized parent fractal consists of 3 large, nearly 
; circular bays, with a large area of apparent chaos on the west 
; side.  There are also 2 fragmentary mandibles like those of a 
; fire ant.  It's not a very promising start, but I never give up 
; on a fractal unless it is totally hopeless.
; 
; The first thing I noticed was that the large area of chaos is 
; filled with objects pretending to be minibrots, and that some of 
; these are rather interesting.  I decided to check just west of 
; the largest 'minibrot', in an area consisting mostly of fractal 
; sand, with occasional larger stones thrown in.  I expected to 
; find little of interest, but when I applied a very broad color 
; palette I found that there is a subtle pattern hidden in the 
; chaos.
; 
; Once I emphasized this pattern, I found a previously invisible, 
; symmetrical arrangement of elements that indicates the presence 
; of either a dry valley or a real minibrot.  Luckily, it turned 
; out to be a minibrot, and that minibrot lies at the center of 
; today's image.
; 
; The minibrot is surrounded by a pattern equally as subtle as the 
; pattern of the overall area.  And it also needs to be emphasized 
; by fine tuning the colors.  Unfortunately, I seem to have gone a 
; bit too far with the colors, resulting in a texture too rough 
; and muddy to make a great image.  But the rating of a 6 that I 
; gave the image is fair enough.
; 
; I named the image "Forever Fractured" because of the excessively 
; rough texture of the image.  The calculation time of 2-1/2 
; minutes will not be too much of a burden, but an even faster way 
; to see the image is to view it on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Tuesday was a bit chilly around the edges, but a fine autumn day 
; nevertheless here at Fractal Central, with a temperature of 50F 
; 10C.  The fractal cats, (designated so by me), were on their 
; best behavior most all day.  The only slip was when Cassie took 
; her sharpened claws to the arm of my favorite chair.
; 
; Other than this, my day went as good as could be expected.  Only 
; the day's fractal fell a bit short.  But the next FOTD will be 
; posted here in 24 hours, and who knows, it may be the best of 
; all time.  Until then, take care, and if the outer world is as 
; real as the Mandelbrot set, then what's going on?
