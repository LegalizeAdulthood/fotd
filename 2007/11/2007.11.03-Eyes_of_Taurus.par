; FOTD -- November 03, 2007 (Rating 5.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In the mail today I received the holiday offering from a popular-
; ized science book club I belong to.  Most of the books offered 
; were of the typical 'learn string theory in a day' variety.  But 
; on the back page of the advertising magazine I saw an offer for 
; a $199.00 book titled "The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief", which 
; when ordered for the special club member's price of $124.99 will 
; come wrapped in holiday gift wrapping.
; 
; It seems to me like some kind of macabre joke, giving someone a 
; book about Atheism for Christmas.  It is probably no accident 
; that the book is published by a well-known skeptical organiza-
; tion that exposes phony psychics and generally debunks claims of 
; the paranormal.  Their real agenda is the promotion of Atheistic 
; Rationalism.  Hmmmm . . . I wonder if hard-core skeptics believe 
; in the reality of fractals.
; 
; Anyway, it doesn't matter what skeptics believe, since I am a 
; true-believing born-again believer in fractal reality -- at 
; least a true believer in the reality of pictures of fractals.  
; And to prove my point, I have included the parameter file of a 
; fractal that was created by the formula Z^(1.5)+C.
; 
; To create the parent fractal I turned to the MandelbrotBC1 
; formula, which is a more versatile version of the MandelbrotBC2 
; formula.  To add extra interest, I calculated the formula with 
; the function set to 'cotan', rather than the hard-coded 'floor' 
; function of the MandelbrotBC2 formula.  The result is a totally 
; different fractal.
; 
; This new fractal is little more than a shapeless bay surrounded 
; by filaments and chaos.  Today's scene is located in a small, 
; narrow, pinched-off valley on the northwest shore line of the 
; shapeless bay.  I named the image "Eyes of Taurus" because of 
; the multitude of bulls-eyes scattered throughout the scene.  The 
; little minibrot just to the upper right of center adds a point 
; of interest.
; 
; But despite all this, I could not bring myself to rate the scene 
; any better than a 5.5, and a half-point of this is due to the 
; extra effort I put into the coloring.
; 
; At least not too much time will be spent calculating the image.  
; The included parameter file runs in 5 minutes.  And for those 
; who do not calculate, the finished image is available on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Only a slight nip in the air kept Friday from reaching total 
; perfection here at Fractal Central.  The cloudless skies and 
; high temperature of 55F 13C made any outdoor activity except 
; swimming a pleasure.  The fractal cats voiced their agreement as 
; they asked for their tuna.  Other than the book offer, my day 
; passed with nothing worth mentioning taking place.  The next 
; FOTD will be posted in more or less 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and be where it's at.
