; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal image has texture, and lots of it.  In fact, it 
; might set a new record for texture.  The scene of the action 
; lies in the Z^(1.44225)+C Mandeloid as it appears a single turn 
; up the logarithmic hyperspiral when the function is eliminated 
; by setting it to 'ident'.
; 
; The value of the exponent--1.44225--happens to be the cube root 
; of 3.  I chose it because I dislike absolutely random exponents. 
; The parent fractal consists of a single large bay with an almost 
; equally large triangular bud on its north side.  Today's scene 
; with its jagged and poorly defined minibrot at the center is 
; located near a larger minibrot that lies on a filament extending 
; east from this triangular bud.
; 
; The near-ridiculous amount of texture was achieved by rendering 
; the scene with the outside set to 'imag'.  A high-contrast color 
; palette increased the effect.  I have no idea how to rate an 
; image that I went out of my way to sabotage, so I let it go with 
; a question mark for a rating.
; 
; The name "Take it or Leave it" implies that I do not expect 
; everyone to approve of such a harsh image.  But the image is not 
; a total loss.  A careful examination reveals a subtle pattern 
; amid the chaos, which just might make a worthy, more convention-
; al image if I were to emphasize it by more appropriate coloring.
; 
; The included parameter file takes 3-1/2 minutes to run on the 
; fast machine and 12 minutes on the slow one, a reasonable time 
; by any standards.  But if reason fails, do not panic.  Simply 
; rush to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; If the image is not already posted there for instant viewing, it 
; soon will be.
; 
; With 100-percent sunshine and light winds, the high temperature 
; of 46F 8C here at Fractal Central on Sunday felt quite pleasant. 
; The fractal cats agreed as they stretched on their shelf in the 
; sunniest window.
; 
; Except for a customer who for some reason called about his job 
; at 11am, my day was totally without incident, the weird fractal 
; notwithstanding that is.  And speaking of fractals, the next one 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and the philos-
; ophy of materialism is quite rational, and it makes good common 
; sense, but what if the world does not obey the rules of reason 
; and common sense?
