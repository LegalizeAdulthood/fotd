; FOTD -- November 17, 2007 (Rating 6.5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image, which is named "Forty-Ninth Radical", takes us 
; once again to the Mandelbrot set.  The name has no connection to 
; the Forty-Ninth Parallel that separates Canada from the U.S.  It 
; refers instead to the tiny radical with a periodicity of 49 on 
; the south shore of East Valley of the M-set.  A radical refers 
; to all the stuff, such as filaments and sub-bays, associated 
; with a particular bud of a particular periodicity.  I think Mr. 
; Mandelbrot himself created the name.  Today's image is located 
; deep in the star associated with the 49th radical.
; 
; Virtually the entire effect of the image is due to the coloring, 
; so I had no choice to reward myself an extra half-point for the 
; color work, making the image worth a grand total of 6-1/2.
; 
; The prominent octagon with rounded corners that surrounds the 
; minibrot in the image appears to be somewhat askew.  Actually, 
; it is perfectly straight.  All the crookedness is a true part 
; of the Mandelbrot set at this point.
; 
; The calculation time of a lightning-fast 15 seconds is true on 
; the fast 2000mhz machine.  On the slow 200mhz unit the same 
; image takes over 5 minutes to finish.  One would assume that a 
; machine 10 times as fast would calculate a fractal in 1/10 of 
; the time, but my machine does it in 1/20 of the time, at least 
; with the type=mandel and type=julia fractals.  Curiously, with 
; type=formula images, where I do most of my fractal work, the 
; fast machine finishes in only 1/5 of the time.
; 
; All this confusion about calculation time can only detract from 
; the worth of the image, so why not view the finished product on 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and end the day with fractal satisfaction.
; 
; Cloudy and blustery weather with near freezing temperatures 
; prevailed all day Friday here at Fractal Central.  A few insig-
; nificant flurries of snow simply added to the interest.  The 
; fractal cats must have been annoyed by the conditions, for they 
; got into a tussle when Cassie took Nico's favorite spot in the 
; window and he had to bat her out of the way.  An hour later 
; however they had made up and were washing each other's ears.
; 
; My day was busy enough to keep boredom at bay, but not too busy 
; for relaxation.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and things are not always as they seem.
