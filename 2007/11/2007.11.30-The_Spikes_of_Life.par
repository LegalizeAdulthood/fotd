; FOTD -- November 30, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have been having trouble getting connected to Mindspring in 
; the evenings lately, which is why I sometimes post the Fractint 
; version of the FOTD through AOL and do not post the philofractal 
; version until the next morning.  (The philofractal list does not 
; like AOL's HTML e-mail encoding.)
; 
; Earthlink says it is a lack of capacity in this area -- a rather 
; shameful statement for a leading ISP to make.  Oh well, we'll 
; give them a chance and see how it goes from here.  They have 
; been quite reliable for over 10 years.
; 
; We end the month of November with another fractal that rates a 
; 6, not that a 6 is a bad rating, it's just so bland.  The day's 
; fractal lies in the main spike area of the Z^(2.001)+C Mandeloid 
; as it appears 0.01 level up the complex logarithmic ladder when 
; calculated by the MandelbrotBC1 formula, with no function used 
; in the calculation.
; 
; The spiky effect was achieved by rendering the image with the 
; outside set to 'fmod' and the proximity set to 0.09.  I named 
; the image "The Spikes of Life" for no sensible reason.  Since 
; the name is senseless, the calculation time had better be brief. 
; And indeed it is.  The 29 seconds will try the patience of not 
; even the most impatient fractalist.
; 
; And as always, a trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; will be equally fast and even more exciting.
; 
; Despite brisk winds, Thursday was really quite pleasant here at 
; Fractal Central.  The temperature reached a high of 54F 12C and 
; there was ample sunshine.  The fractal cats must have agreed, 
; for one of them celebrated by pulling up a corner of the carpet 
; in the living room.  They both looked guilty but claimed 
; innocence.
; 
; In my department, normality prevailed.  The day's fractal might 
; have been worth a higher rating, but what the heck, nobody is 
; perfect.  The next FOTD fractal will be posted in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and what if the theory of everything 
; turns out to be a theory of nothing?
