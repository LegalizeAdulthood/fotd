; FOTD -- April 08, 2007 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; My apologies for a late Easter Sunday FOTD.  In fact, today's 
; FOTD is both brief and late.  But Easter will soon pass, the 
; heavy graphic work is already finished, and with any luck at 
; all, things will be back in their accustomed routine by Tuesday.
; 
; The fractal for today takes us to the Z^(1.25) Mandeloid as it 
; appears 121 levels up the logarithmic spiral.  At this lofty 
; level, the fractal resembles little more than a shapeless blob 
; with a few hints of equally-shapeless buds.  The active little 
; midget, which appears to be exploding near the center of today's 
; image, is located just inland of the ragged bud on the northeast 
; shoreline of the main bay of its shapeless parent fractal.
; 
; With almost no time to devote to fine-tuning today's image, I 
; could not give it a name or rating.  But luckily the image is a 
; fast one, rendering in only 2-1/3 minutes on my worn-out 10-year-
; old computer, which is well past the point of no return.  So if 
; the image disappoints, little time and effort will have been 
; wasted.
; 
; It is never a wasted effort however to visit the FOTD web page 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the finished FOTD images there.
; 
; Saturday brought cold temperatures, some sunshine, heavy clouds 
; and snow squalls to Fractal Central.  The fractal cats interrup-
; ted their usual activities long enough to watch the snow fall, 
; then, satisfied that all was well, they returned to their fun 
; and games.
; 
; My day was not too busy with serious work, but it was far from 
; slow.  Against my advice, fractal lady invited some friends to 
; Easter dinner on Sunday, and I was selected to purchase the 
; supplies.  Oh well, unlike the FOTD, Easter comes only once a 
; year.  BTW, the next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and search for the meaning of fractals.
