; FOTD -- April 13, 2007 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; So it's the 10th anniversary of the FOTD.  It's been the fastest 
; 10 years in recorded history.  Luckily, it was mentioned on the 
; lists, for I had totally forgotten it.
; 
; For the 10th anniversary we have a relatively plain fractal, 
; which rates only a 4.  This is slightly-below-average.  I named 
; the image "Alternate Critical" because its parent is the fractal 
; that results when yesterday's formula is calculated with Z 
; initialized to the alternate critical value of the function 
; Z^(2.4)-Z^(2.6).
; 
; A little calculation shows that the two critical points of this 
; function are zero and 0.670176937.  The MandAutoCritInZ formula 
; automatically initializes Z to 0.670176937, so it was necessary 
; to enter a value of negative 0.670176937 as the real(p4) 
; parameter in order to re-initialize Z to the second critical 
; point of zero.
; 
; At the surface, the fractal that results when Z is set to zero 
; is a virtual copy of yesterday's parent fractal, which somewhat 
; resembles the cubic Mandelbrot set rotated 90 degrees.  But it 
; is not an exact copy.  A quick examination of the surface re-
; veals subtle differences, which quickly become major differences 
; as one zooms down into the fractal.
; 
; Today's image shows a scene located near a larger midget on a 
; filament at the western end of the parent.  The midget at the 
; center is a curious one indeed.  Apparently, it cannot decide 
; whether to be a quadratic midget or something else.  If it is 
; trying to be a quadratic midget, it is doing a pretty poor job 
; of it, since the expected powers-of-two series of elements that 
; usually surrounds quadratic midgets is nowhere to be seen.  
; Nothing is visible around the midget but a chaotic assemblage of 
; cut-up pieces of fractal stuff.  I can see a series of 2, 5, and 
; 12 elements, which would seem to indicate a power around 2.5 -- 
; the average of 2.4 and 2.6.
; 
; As for the quality of the image, the less said the better.  This 
; is especially true when its inordinate calculation time is 
; considered.  I do not know how long the image would have taken 
; on the fractal workhorse machine, a P200, but it took 16 minutes 
; on the P4-2000.  I will send it on ahead to Paul at the FOTD web 
; site so that it will be posted ready for viewing as soon as this 
; discussion appears.  The FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; I'm out of time right now, but I'll explain the workings of all 
; the MandelbrotMix formulas in tomorrow's discussion.
; 
; Heavy clouds, showers of rain, and a chilly temperature of 48F 
; 9C kept a damper on things here at Fractal Central on Thursday.  
; The fractal cats' spirits were not dampened however.  They 
; managed to pull a stack of newspapers from the shelf and rip 
; them to shreds all over the living room floor.  After the mess 
; they made, they hardly deserved their evening treat of tuna and 
; cheddar cheese.
; 
; My day was average, and as far as I can see, the days will 
; remain average indefinitely.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until next time, take care, and where did all the 
; numbers go?
