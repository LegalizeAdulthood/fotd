; FOTD -- April 24, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was created when the formula Z^(1.3)+C was 
; iterated 13 levels up the logarithmic ladder, with the escape 
; radius set to 625.  The parent fractal is a Mandeloid with 
; several bays and an extremely long main filament.  A prominent 
; midget lies about midway out this filament.  This midget is 
; shaped much like the entire parent fractal, with several bays.  
; Today's scene lies rather deep in one of the valleys that 
; separate the bays.
; 
; I named the image "Valley Scenery", since it is little more than 
; a snapshot of what exists deep in a valley of a midget in a 
; Mandeloid of order 1.3.  The tiny midget at the center of the 
; image is almost an accidental intruder.  It has little to do 
; with the main part of the image, which is little more than a 
; collection of mostly random bits and pieces.
; 
; One tiny bit of interest exists near the edges of some of the 
; larger pieces of fractal stuff in the foreground, where comb-
; like features appear to be sprouting.  There could be a bit of 
; excitement in one of these combs, but the entire area is too 
; slow for convenient exploration.
; 
; The rating of a 6 might be a bit overdone.  One thing definitely 
; overdone however is the calculation time of over 1-1/2 hours.  
; But the wait may be avoided by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; I sent the image on ahead to Paul at the FOTD web site about an 
; hour ago, so it should be posted for viewing very soon.
; 
; Friday was the fourth near-perfect day in a row here at Fractal 
; Central, with lots of sun, gentle winds, and a high temperature 
; of 84F 29C.  The big excitement for the fractal cats came in the 
; morning, when a lovesick tomcat wandered by, calling out for any 
; lady cat within hearing.  The local fractal lady cat, Cassie, 
; seemed unimpressed by the scraggly intruder.  My day was about 
; average, though an extra long lunch did put the real work a bit 
; behind.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and be fractally oriented.
