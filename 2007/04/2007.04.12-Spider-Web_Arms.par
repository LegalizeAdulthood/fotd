; FOTD -- April 12, 2007 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we introduce a new formula, which will replace the old 
; MandelbrotMix4 formula.  The new formula is named 
; MandAutoCritInZ.  This is short for "Mandelbrot -- Automatic 
; Critical value of Initial Z".  And this is exactly what the old 
; M-Mix4 formula did.  The new formula adds an additional variable 
; parameter to the old formula, which allows an extra adjustment 
; to initial Z.  This is necessary because some functions of the 
; type handled by the new formula have two critical points, and 
; the formula calculates only one of them.
; 
; A drawback of the new formula is that it can not initialize Z 
; to the second critical point automatically.  To do this, both 
; critical points must be manually calculated and the difference 
; entered as the adjustment to Z.  This may be done graphically or 
; mathematically.  The graphic method is far more fun.
; 
; Sometimes both critical points produce identical fractals; 
; sometimes the identical fractals are mirror images of each 
; other; sometimes the two critical points produce totally 
; different fractals.  Finding out is much of the fun of the new 
; formula.
; 
; Today's image was created by subtracting Z^(2.6) from Z^(2.4) 
; and adding C.  I named it "Spider Web Arms" because the pattern 
; in the four angular arms around the central midget reminds me of 
; spider webs.  The spider-webs are actually open-inside areas 
; decorated by the 'fmod' inside fill.  I rather like the image, 
; so I rated it at an 8.
; 
; Today's image is a slow one, with a calculation time of over 43 
; minutes.  But the wait may be avoided by visiting the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the completely rendered image is or soon will be posted 
; for instant viewing.
; 
; In tomorrow's FOTD I'll discuss all the MandelbrotMix formulas 
; and what they are supposed to do.
; 
; A sunny mild morning turned into a cloudy mild afternoon here at 
; Fractal Central on Wednesday.  The temperature reached 52F 11C, 
; which is still well below normal.  Rain moved in at nightfall, 
; but by then the fractal cats had finished their evening treats 
; and were more concerned with washing each other's faces and 
; chasing each other up and down the hallway.
; 
; My day was actually not too unpleasant.  And the above-average 
; fractal for today shows it.  The next fractal, hopefully also 
; above average, will appear here in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and don't get lost in an ocean of iterations.
