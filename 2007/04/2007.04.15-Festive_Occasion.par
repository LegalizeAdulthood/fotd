; FOTD -- April 15, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent fractal of today's image came about when I subtracted 
; 3 parts of Z^(1.1) from 3 parts of (Z).  This parent fractal is 
; quite oversized and needs an outzoom before it fits onto the 
; screen.  It looks like a Mandelbrot set rotated 180 degrees, 
; with its East Valley pinched off.  Some might see it as a lead 
; plumb.
; 
; Today's image is located in the angular, star-like debris on the 
; southeast shoreline of the main bud of its parent.  I named it 
; "Festive Occasion" and rated it at a 7.  Much of the effect is 
; due to the colors, and when rating the image I decided to reward 
; myself for the extra effort.
; 
; It's really a rather pleasant image to look at.  If it has a 
; flaw, that flaw would have to be the rather slow calculation 
; time of 14 minutes.  But this small inconvenience can be quickly 
; eliminated by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the already-calculated image there.
; 
; A sunny morning gave way to increasing afternoon clouds here at 
; Fractal Central on Saturday.  The high temperature of 55F 13C 
; was not too bad, but it should be in the 60's F (around 18C) at 
; this time of year.  Fractal cats do not concern themselves with 
; weather however.  Their concern is playing and eating.  The duo 
; did a lot of both on Saturday.
; 
; My day was average; more of the same is expected on Sunday.  The 
; next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; infinity is as close as your computer.
