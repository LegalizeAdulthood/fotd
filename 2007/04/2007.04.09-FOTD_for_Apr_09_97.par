; FOTD -- April 09, 2007 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows the type of fractal I was fascinated with 
; about 15 years ago.  It is a scene on the northern shoreline of 
; the Mandelbrot set, just west of the large northern bud.  But it 
; does not resemble this area as we know it.  (To see a more 
; familiar view of the same scene, change both parameters to zero 
; and recalculate the image.)  The strange appearance indicates 
; that the image is a scene in a perturbed M-set.
; 
; The fossilized buds that form the ghostly remains of the 'true' 
; M-set are plainly visible as background shadows, but they are 
; partly obscured by the surging low-iteration 'perturbed' stuff 
; that is swiftly overwhelming the scene.  If the parameters are 
; changed ever so slightly, the purplish foreground stuff will 
; shift position dramatically.  But if the fossil buds in the back-
; ground are visible at all, they will be in the same position.
; 
; The background buds do not change position when the starting 
; point is changed because in perturbed sets, regardless of where 
; points begin their travels, if they do not escape first, they 
; will eventually settle into the same orbits as points that start 
; at zero.
; 
; There is much more to tell about the fossil buds visible in 
; today's image, but that will have to wait until a slower day.  
; For now, I must point out that today's scene is neither named 
; nor rated.  And its calculation time is just under 15 minutes.  
; But as always, the completed image is or soon will be available 
; for quick viewing on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather continued most un-springlike here at Fractal Central 
; on Easter Sunday, with cloudy skies, temperatures hovering 
; around 36F 2C, and flurries of snow throughout the day.  The 
; fractal cats noted the snowflakes, but were more interested in 
; seeing how much turkey they could beg.  They were courteous at 
; first, but when Cassie leaped onto the table and started helping 
; herself to the turkey, they were banned from the dining room for 
; the duration.  Guests don't appreciate cats of any variety 
; snatching slices of turkey from their plates.
; 
; I managed to get through the whole dinner affair somehow.  And 
; now that it is behind me, I can look forward to things returning 
; to normal in the upcoming week.  The next grand FOTD will appear 
; in 24 hours.  Check back then to enjoy or ignore it.
