; FOTD -- April 17, 2007 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image lies in the same stubby Seahorse Valley of the 
; same parent fractal that produced yesterday's image.  But it 
; lies far enough away from the scene of yesterday's action to 
; appear quite different.
; 
; About 1/10th of the image consists of 'inside' stuff made 
; visible by the 'zmag' inside fill.  The rest of the image is 
; made of good old equal-iteration bands.
; 
; I named today's image "Another Visitation" because it is the 
; second visit in as many days to the same scene.  I rated it an 
; 8 because I think it makes quite an interesting screen full.
; 
; The render time of 12 minutes can be avoided by visiting the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the image there.
; 
; I am involved in writing a discussion of how I find good 
; parameters to enter into the MandAutoCritInZ formula.  To my 
; surprise, I find that I am not sure how I find some of the good 
; parameters.  But I almost always start by setting one of the 
; exponents to an absolute value between 1 and 2.  How I find the 
; alternate critical point to enter as the (p4) parameter is 
; another story, which I will explain in detail in the discussion.
; 
; Finding good parameters for the MandelbrotBC2 formula, which I 
; used in today's FOTD, is a far simpler task.  Either I choose an 
; exponent between +1 and +2, or an exponent very close to a 
; positive integer, such as today's 1.99.  A value of 2.01 would 
; have created an equally interesting parent fractal, though the 
; fractal would have rotated in the opposite direction as the 
; logarithmic ladder was ascended.
; 
; A chilly temperature of 43F 6C, heavy clouds, strong winds and 
; occasional showers of mixed rain and snow made conditions less 
; than ideal for those whose business took them outdoors here in 
; Fractal Central country on Monday.  A tuna treat that was late 
; made the day less than ideal for the fractal cats also.
; 
; With the work getting lighter and the fractals getting better, 
; my day was pretty good however.  And the best part is that 
; tomorrow looks to be a repeat.  Until then, take care, and 
; beware of scam fractals.
