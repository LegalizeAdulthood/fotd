; FOTD -- April 11, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'll soon be posting a discussion about how I choose good 
; parameters for the MandelbrotMix4 formula.  I had hoped to have 
; it ready today, but the truth is I am not sure exactly how I 
; find my parameters.  I would have assumed that the exponents in 
; today's formula are too close together to do much of interest, 
; but I entered them in the M-Mix4 formula anyway.
; 
; Today's parameters define a formula that combines Z^(1.95) with 
; Z^(2.05) and adds straight C.  I chose the exponents because the 
; average of 1.95 and 2.05 is 2, and since Z^2+C is the classic 
; Mandelbrot formula, I wondered if a formula where the average of 
; the exponents is 2 would have anything special to offer.  As it 
; turned out nothing unusual appeared.  The parent fractal 
; resembles one of the perturbed Mandelbrot sets, with a very non-
; critical look about it that makes the search for interior 
; midgets almost useless.  But even though there are no midgets in 
; the parent fractal, there are many interesting nooks and 
; crannies, with much to explore.
; 
; Today's image is located very near the negative X-axis of the 
; parent fractal, in a blunt valley centered on the axis and 
; pointing east.  I named it "Odd Fractal Out", since it has no 
; midgets hidden within it and I could think of nothing better.  
; The rating of a 6 might be a bit liberal, but the image really 
; is rather striking, and the calculation time of 9-1/2 minutes is 
; marginally within reason.  Those do not calculate Fractint 
; parameter files may view the image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it is posted for sheer enjoyment.
; 
; I have updated the MandelbrotMix4 formula, and starting tomorrow 
; I'll retire the old workhorse and switch to the new version for 
; most of my fractals.  The newer version will be able to draw the 
; fractals that result when Z is initialized to a second critical 
; point of the formula.
; 
; Heavy clouds and continued chilly temperatures in the 40's F 
; (around 8C) made Tuesday far less than ideal here at Fractal 
; Central.  The fractal cats must have agreed, for they were 
; unusually sulky most of the day.  It took extra tuna to raise 
; their spirits.
; 
; My day was actually quite pleasant, at least compared to the way 
; things have been for the past couple months.  And tomorrow looks 
; to be a repeat.  I already have tomorrow's FOTD fractal, and 
; it's a pretty good one, so check back here in 24 hours for a 
; fractal surprise.  Until then, take care, and search for those 
; patterns in the void.
