; FOTD -- April 07, 2007 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image came about when I combined 4 negative parts of 
; Z^(-1.25) with 0.2 negative parts of Z^(-6.67) and added (1/C).  
; This mixture produced an oversized parent fractal consisting of 
; 4 large bays and a very prominent 'fan'.  Many baby Mandelbrot 
; sets lie along the outer edge of this 'fan', with today's image 
; lying deep in the East Valley of the largest of these midgets.
; 
; Due to the computer problem here at F.C. I had little time to 
; work on today's image, which means I could give it no name.  I 
; did give the colors a bit of attention however, which justifies 
; the rating of a 6.
; 
; I have some bad news and some good news.  The bad news is that 
; the image takes 37 minutes to calculate on my 10-year-old P200 
; machine; the good news is that the completed image may be viewed 
; almost instantly on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; An unseasonable temperature of 37F 3C and flurries of snow made 
; Good Friday an appropriately somber day here at Fractal Central. 
; But the main FC computer is repaired, reconnected, and running 
; as good as new.  The problem was what we suspected -- a block of 
; memory had worked loose.  Now all I must do is make up the time 
; that was lost while the fast machine was in the shop.  I have 
; also decided that it might be time to pick up a new computer and 
; switch the aging 2300mhz machine to fractal work.
; 
; The fractal cats do not concern themselves with computers.  
; Their main concern is to keep as warm as possible, which they 
; did quite well most all day.  The next FOTD will be posted in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and become one with the infinite, 
; whatever that means.
