; FOTD -- April 18, 2007 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent of today's image came about when I subtracted 0.6 
; parts of Z^(1.618) from 0.6 parts of Z^(-1.4142) and added 
; straight C.  This fractal can hardly be called a fractal.  It is 
; more of an oversized universe of fractals, consisting of one 
; large and very distorted Mandeloid, a smaller less-distorted 
; Mandeloid, and two prominent but shapeless holes.  Scattered 
; around these obvious features lie countless smaller holes of all 
; shapes.  Today's image is located in the East Valley of the 
; largest Mandeloid.
; 
; I didn't dare name today's image.  I would not want to admit 
; what it reminds me of.  I did rate it at a 7 however, mostly 
; because of the extra snap I added to the color palette.  It is 
; really a rather striking image.  Perhaps the best feature of the 
; image is its extreme speed.  It calculates from the included 
; parameter file in a mere 1 minute and 43 seconds, which is less 
; time than it would take to go online and view the completed 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; No special tricks were used in today's image.  It was rendered 
; with the inside set to number zero and the outside set to show 
; the traditional equal-iteration bands.
; 
; The slightly milder temperature of 48F 9C here at Fractal 
; Central on Tuesday failed to compensate for the continued heavy 
; clouds, brisk winds and occasional sprinkles of rain.  The 
; fractal cats had an unexpectedly good day despite the weather.  
; They spent much of their time in the window, watching two doves 
; that were hanging around the porch most all day.
; 
; My day was quite peaceful for a change; I hope tomorrow can be a 
; repeat.  The next FOTD will appear here in 24 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and don't let a stubborn fractal get you down.
