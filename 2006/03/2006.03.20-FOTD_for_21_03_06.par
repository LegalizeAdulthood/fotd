; FOTD -- March 21, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is an 'evaporated ' one created by the good old 
; MandelbrotMix4 formula, the most prolific producer of FOTD 
; images in my collection.
; 
; To achieve the image, a bit of Z^(-11.1) was combined with 
; Z^(-1.1), and (1/C) was added.  Then the entire thing was 
; 'evaporated' by raising the escape radius to an astronomical 
; one-googol, which means that every point on the Cartesian plane 
; is trapped, leaving the screen a flat color.
; 
; But luckily, the Fractint program can do things with such 
; hopeless images.  It has certain inside fills that check the 
; things the points do even though they are trapped.  In today's 
; case, the 'bof61' inside fill reveals the ghost of a midget that 
; was located at that point before the image was evaporated.
; 
; Since I am reasonably unimpressed with the result, I gave the 
; image neither name nor rating.  The rather slow render time of 
; 16-1/2 minutes may be avoided by downloading the finished GIF 
; file of the image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A few months ago, Paul Lee, who runs the FOTD web site, made an 
; offer to expand the site.  At the time I declined the offer, but 
; I think I will soon reconsider.  Stay tuned for possible changes 
; soon to come.
; 
; The unseasonably chilly weather continued Monday here at Old 
; Fractal Central, making things rather unpleasant for the fractal 
; cats, who desire warm breezes and lots of tuna.  Unfortunately, 
; the tuna was all they had on Monday.  In my department, the work 
; turned heavy, though still under control.  The next FOTD is due 
; to appear in 24 hours.  It actually might do just that.  Until 
; then, take care, and be of good faith.
