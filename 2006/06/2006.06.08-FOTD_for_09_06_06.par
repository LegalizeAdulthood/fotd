; FOTD -- June 09, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Re-organization has been going better than anticipated here at 
; New Fractal Central.  As a result, we are close to the point 
; where the FOTD can resume its daily schedule, with new and even 
; greater fractal scenes to come.  But we are not quite yet at 
; that point, so there could easily be occasional missing FOTD's 
; over the next few weeks.
; 
; Today's image shows what the Fractint biomorph option can do.  
; I applied to a midget deep in the fractal that results when 
; Z^(-2.8) is subtracted from Z^(-1.1) and (1/C) is added.  The 
; image resembles nothing so much as a fancy floral arrangement.  
; Since I put very little effort into the image, I have given it 
; no name or rating, but it really is worth a quick look.
; 
; The render time of under 5 minutes is brief enough to make 
; running the included parameter file almost enjoyable.  Total 
; enjoyment may be found by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the finished GIF image from there.
; 
; Clouds, cool temperatures and occasional showers continued here 
; at New Fractal Central on Thursday.  Sadly, we do not yet have 
; fractal cats to report on, but I expect a couple eager new guys 
; to appear within a week or so.  The next FOTD is due in 24 
; hours.  From the way things are going, it might actually make it.
; 
; Until next time, take care, and if everything is fractal, then 
; nothing is not fractal.
