; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Due to a late night out, we're a bit late with today's image, 
; but it's better late than never.
; 
; Today's image rates a 5 and has been names "Surprised Cyclops".  
; Well, it's what I saw when I studied the image.  It is a view of 
; a midget in East Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  But it looks 
; nothing like a Mandelbrot midget.  Nor does it resemble a Julia 
; set of East Valley.  True, there is a vague feeling of East 
; Valley-ness in the image, but the so-called midget is nothing 
; more than a shapeless hole that might have been bitten out of 
; the background by an alien zombie (or cyclops).
; 
; The bifurcating 4-8-16 pattern of elements that surrounds every 
; Mandelbrot Midget and Julia midget has been so distorted that it 
; is barely recognizable.  The stretched and twisted elements are 
; a sure sign that we are viewing a remote oblique slice of the 
; Julibrot, the four-dimensional object of which the Mandelbrot 
; set and all Julia sets are but differently-oriented two-dimen-
; sional sections.
; 
; Everyone with any interest at all in math wonders what the 
; fourth dimension is.  It is totally impossible to visualize, yet 
; we can work with it quite well and know as much about it as we 
; do about the third dimension.
; 
; 4-D objects are in no way merely unusually-complex 3-D objects.  
; They are entirely different animals, hypersolid monstrosities 
; with outer surfaces that are fully three-dimensional.  It is 
; immediately apparent that we have no chance of seeing an entire 
; 4-D object at a single moment of time with our physical eyes.  
; Our retinas have two-dimensional surfaces and could never 
; receive all the information in a 4-D cone of light.  The most we 
; could do would be to scan the 4-D object one 3-D slice at a 
; time, making time the fourth dimension.  We would see a 3-D 
; object changing shape over time -- a feeble impression of 4-D 
; space.
; 
; But though we could never see a 4-D object with our physical 
; eyes, could we visualize it with our inner eyes, which have a 
; greater range than our physical eyes?  Once again the answer is 
; a resounding no.  Some mysterious limit blocks even our 
; imagination.  I suspect that this limit is deeply involved with 
; our stage of consciousness.  We are at the 3-D stage of con-
; sciousness, and to visualize the fourth dimension, we would need 
; to expand our consciousness.  Can mystics, who expand their 
; awareness, visualize the fourth dimension in their expanded 
; imagination?  If they could, how could we determine it?  Even if 
; they did, they could do nothing but relate to us the things they 
; had experienced.  But we already know about 4-D space and the 
; things they would describe.  Mystics might claim that they had 
; actually visualized the fourth dimension, but they would have no 
; way to prove it.
; 
; As for today's tiny slice of a 4-D monstrosity, it renders in 
; 4-1/2 minutes.  Due to the lateness of this message, there might 
; be a delay before the completed image is posted to the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Partly cloudy skies, dry air, and a temperature of 81F 27C made 
; things quite pleasant here at New Fractal Central on Saturday.  
; But the new fractal cats were more interested in wrecking 
; today's newspaper than in the weather.  If they can find so much 
; enjoyment in a small Saturday paper, they will really go bonkers 
; over tomorrow's larger Sunday paper.  The local fireworks 
; display went off only four blocks away Saturday evening, making 
; quite a bit of noise.  Cassie ducked under the bed for a few 
; minutes, but soon realized that there was no threat.  Nico 
; actually went to the window to see what all the excitement was 
; about.
; 
; For me, things are settling down here at N.F.C.  We are not yet 
; at the point where we can find any object almost without 
; thinking of where it is stored, but we are making good progress 
; toward that goal.  The next FOTD will appear in 15 hours.  Until 
; then, take care, and keep your feet on the earth and your head 
; in the clouds.
