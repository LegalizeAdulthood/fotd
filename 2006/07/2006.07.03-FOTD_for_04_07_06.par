; FOTD -- July 04, 2006 (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With today's image I have resumed rating the FOTD images.  The 
; rating of a 4 is not a very impressive start, but it is better 
; than no rating at all.  In a few days, if all goes well, I will 
; resume naming the images.
; 
; I actually seem to have gotten a bit rusty during the several 
; months we were occupied with moving Fractal Central.  The images 
; seem to be fighting me.  No longer do they come almost automati-
; cally.  But I am sure it will be only a short time before I am 
; back in top fractal-finding form and writing philofractal discus-
; sions worthy of an avatar.
; 
; Today is not that day however.  The notably unimpressive image 
; pictures a midget in the Z^(sqrt(2))+C Mandeloid as it appears 
; 16 levels up the unending logarithmic ladder.  If I had named 
; the image, I would likely have named it "Splat".  The overall 
; impression is one of a paint-ball splatter.
; 
; I used only the most basic rendering method.  Any fancy stuff 
; would have been wasted on an image with this degree of chaos.  
; The 7-minute render time might seem slow to those whose time is 
; important.  If so, save time by downloading the finished GIF 
; image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Typical summer weather prevailed again here at New Fractal Cen-
; tral on Monday, with partly cloudy, hazy skies, opressive 
; humidity, and a temperature of 88F 31C.  The new fractal cats 
; were unconcerned with weather however, since they do not yet 
; go out.  They were more concerned with the occasional fire-
; cracker that went off in the neighborhood.  When the going got 
; too loud, Cassie ducked under the bed; Nico ran to the window 
; to see what all the noise was about.
; 
; The next FOTD fractal will appear right here in 24 hours.  We 
; will try to produce one that rates at least a 5.  Until then, 
; take care, and the best way I know to find enlightenment is to 
; start a low-calorie diet.
