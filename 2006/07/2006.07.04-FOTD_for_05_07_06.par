; FOTD -- July 05, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image rates a 7 -- not bad for only the third fractal 
; after the resumption of the daily FOTD schedule.  I have not yet 
; decided to resume naming the FOTD fractals, so fractal fans will 
; have to be make do with the date as a name.  Their dis-satisfac-
; tion should not be too great.  One picture is said to be worth a 
; thousand words, which means that one evaporated fractal should 
; be worth at least ten words.
; 
; Today's fractal is indeed an evaporated one, which means that 
; all the escaping 'outside' parts have vanished, leaving only 
; trapped 'inside' stuff.  But as today's image shows, trapped 
; 'inside' stuff can be made quite interesting.
; 
; Today's all-inside scene was brought to life by rendering it 
; with the inside option set to 'bof61', by far the best inside 
; option to use with evaporated fractals.
; 
; The parent fractal was created by combining various portions of 
; Z^(-1.5) and Z^(-11.5) before adding (1/C).
; 
; The render time of just under 8 minutes is marginally slow, but 
; the wait may be avoided by downloading the completed GIF image 
; from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Cloudy, warm and muggy weather, with a temperature of 84F 29C, 
; accompanied by intermittent showers made conditions less than 
; ideal for the big Independence Day fireworks displays here at 
; New Fractal Central.  The noise of the illegal firecrackers 
; kept the fractal cats hiding under the bed for most of the day.  
; They were reluctant to come out even when they heard the can of 
; tuna open, but hunger eventually won out, and they cautiously 
; reappeared to ask for their treats.
; 
; But despite the minor annoyances, my day was enjoyably relax-
; ing.  I actually found a couple hours with nothing to do but 
; watch the shuttle launch on the NASA TV channel.  Too bad I'll 
; never have the chance to go into space, but neither will 
; 99.99999..... percent of the other people on earth.
; 
; Seeing so much energy expended for such a small result makes me 
; glad that fractals consume almost no energy.  The next FOTD will 
; likely appear in 24 hours, until then, take care, and let's send 
; fractals into space instead of people.  Fractals weigh nothing; 
; think of the energy It would save.
