; FOTD -- July 13, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to a minor valley of the Z^(1.5)+C 
; Mandeloid as it appears 1.5 levels down the complex log ladder. 
; I named it "Fractal Kind of Thing" for the reason that that's 
; what it is.  Unable to decide on a rating, I let the image go 
; un-rated.
; 
; The image is a departure from my usual style of fractal.  
; Instead of a midget and its hectic surrounding pattern, we have 
; a serene infinite blue background with a fractal something 
; floating by in the foreground.
; 
; The effect of infinitely deep space was achieved by rendering 
; the image with the outside set to 'fmod'.  Those who find the 
; 5-minute render time too slow may download the finished image 
; almost instantly from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A warm muggy Wednesday here at New Fractal Central was spoiled 
; at 7pm by a lively thunder-shower.  The fractal cats were 
; startled by some of the louder thunder claps, but did not go 
; into hiding.  Though my day was busier than average, the work 
; was finished promptly.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  It is looking more 
; likely that after tomorrow there will be a week or so hiatus 
; in the FOTD while fractal lady and I refresh ourselves at some 
; out-of-the-way place yet to be determined.  It will be a time 
; to actually do nothing.  Such vacations are not only the most 
; relaxing, they are the least expensive.  Until tomorrow, take 
; more care than seems humanly possible.
