; FOTD -- July 12, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I was rather busy on Tuesday, which explains the lateness and 
; briefness of today's image.  I'm trying to get things wrapped up 
; so we can take a short vacation in a few days.  I deserve some 
; time off.  I think it has been 4 years since the last vacation.
; 
; Today's image takes the fractal that results when 33 parts of 
; Z^(-1.6) are subtracted from 33 parts of Z^(-1.5), and finds a 
; promising scene with a quadratic midget in it.  It then evapo-
; rates the scene and renders the resulting blank screen with the 
; outside set to 'bof61'.  The resulting image rates a 6, (in my 
; at opinion at least).  I do not think the image deserves a name.
; 
; The render time of 8 minutes is well within reason for an image 
; with a maxiter of 1000 that consists entirely of trapped points. 
; But to make things even more convenient, the completed GIF image 
; will soon be available on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Hazy, warm and muggy weather continued here at Fractal Central 
; on Tuesday.  The fractal cats, who continued acting like 
; kittens, were notably unconcerned with the weather.  They were 
; more concerned with chasing the large fly that got into the 
; house.  Cassie, the more agile one, finally caught the fly and 
; ate it.  Only one lamp was knocked over in the chase.
; 
; The next FOTD will be posted in 24 hours.  After that, things 
; become uncertain.  Fractal lady and I are thinking of shutting 
; things down for a week or so and taking a long-overdue vacation 
; to places yet to be determined.  BTW, I have purchased a camera 
; to take on any vacation that might happen, so look for pictures 
; of both the old and new fractal cats in the near future.  I'll 
; keep the lists updated as things develop.  Until tomorrow, take 
; care, and expect only good things to happen.  (Note that there 
; is no guarantee of this however.)
