; FOTD -- November 25, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image came about when I mixed 11 parts of Z^1000 with 11 
; parts of Z^(0.3).  The parent fractal that results is most un-
; promising -- little more than a nest of circles.  But sometimes 
; even the most unpromising parents produce outstanding offspring, 
; and this is the case with today's parent fractal.
; 
; Hidden in the parent, near the point where two circles are 
; tangent, lies a tiny nest of interesting fractal semi-chaos.  
; Today's scene is located in this nest.
; 
; The image was calculated with the outside set to 'summ', one of 
; the few times I have used this option.  The other outside 
; options produce images of varying quality.
; 
; I named the image "High Stakes" because of the unusually large 
; exponent of Z in the generating formula.  The rating of a 6 
; seems appropriate for an image that is moderately interesting.
; 
; The render time of under 25 seconds is true on my ancient P200 
; unit with a whopping 16meg of memory, a machine that does not 
; seem to realize that its time of usefulness ended long ago.  On 
; a modern SOTA machine, one that does not panic when a DOS pro-
; gram is booted, the image will render in well under 10 seconds 
; -- hardly a waste of time even for the lowest rated images.
; 
; Those with a fireball-fast but panicky computer will need to 
; visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the image there.
; 
; Friday was far more pleasant here at New Fractal Central, with 
; crystal blue skies, warm late-autumn sunshine, and a temperature 
; of 55F 13C.  The fractal cats interrupted their play long enough 
; to notice the fine weather, which is about as much concern as 
; they ever show for the weather.  They were far more concerned 
; that their evening treats of tuna and cheese were served on time.
; 
; My day was on the slow side, which was good, since I am still on 
; the slow side myself.  But being slow gives far more time for 
; fractals and the philosophy they inspire.  And speaking of phil-
; osophy, it's about time for another outburst.  The outburst may 
; not come in 24 hours, but the next FOTD fractal almost certainly 
; will.  Until then, take care, and wax philosophical, (whoever he 
; might be).
