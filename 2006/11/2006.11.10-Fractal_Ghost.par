; FOTD -- November 11, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Do ghosts exist?  The answer is most certainly yes.  What then 
; are they?  This question is much more difficult to answer.  But 
; whatever they are, ghosts most certainly do exist in the world 
; of fractals as well as the so-called objective world.  And in 
; the case of fractal ghosts, proof of their existence is at hand, 
; for I have caught one in my fractal ghost net.
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the fractal that results when Z^2.5 
; and Z^4.5 are combined and C is added.  I'm not sure what the 
; brilliant blue but partially obscured thing is.  It certainly is 
; not a quadratic midget.  It looks something like a cubic 
; midget, but if so, it is a very distorted one.  The only thing 
; that describes this background thing is a ghost, so I named the 
; image "Fractal Ghost".
; 
; I get the impression that the ghost would fully reveal itself if 
; initial Z were set to a different value, but I have no idea how 
; to determine that value.  As it is, the image received no 
; rating, but even un-rated, it is worth at least a brief look.  
; This brief look may be found by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished image there.  Viewing the image on the 
; web site will also avoid the 5-1/2 minute wait while the image 
; renders.
; 
; Another perfect day (blue skies and a temperature of 66F 19C) 
; here at New Fractal Central on Friday went un-appreciated by the 
; fractal cats, who were more interested in the modular book-
; shelves fractal lady is assembling in the long hallway.  Empty 
; shelves give cats nearly unlimited fun.
; 
; My day was highlighted by a call from my sister, who is now 
; living back at Old Fractal Central with the old fractal cats 
; Thomas and Tippy.  She told me all is well back there and the 
; old cats are sleeping as soundly and enjoying as many tuna 
; treats as they did when I was there.  She also told me that it 
; might be a month or two before my sprained ankle and torm calf 
; muscle are fully repaired.
; 
; Oh well, I'm kind of enjoying all the extra attention I'm 
; getting while hobbling on my walker, but I still can't wait 
; until I'm up and about again.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and who is Kenneth Spratling?
