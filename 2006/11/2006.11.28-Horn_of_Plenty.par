; FOTD -- November 29, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; With its abundance of detail, today's fractal is in marked 
; contrast to yesterday's image, which had a definite lack of 
; intricate detail.  In fact, today's image earned the name "Horn 
; of Plenty", (otherwise known as a cornucopia).  It also earned 
; a rating of a 7, which is not bad as FOTD fractals go.
; 
; The parent fractal came about when I mixed 3 parts of Z^(0.25) 
; with 1 part of Z^(2.5).  This parent appears as a harmless Man-
; delbrot set rotated about 45 degrees CCW, with extra filamentary 
; detail scattered beyond the tip of the main stem.  The scene of 
; today's image is located in this extra detail.
; 
; Since the extra detail is disconnected from the main M-set, the 
; detail around the central midget in today's image is disconnec-
; ted also, though a bit of observation may be necessary to see 
; that some of the elements in the image are floating.
; 
; The unusually brilliant colors, which are largely responsible 
; for the rating of a 7, are a total accident, brought about by a 
; tap of the finger on the 'enter' key.  Sometimes, when all else 
; seems to fail, simply striking 'enter' will produce a pretty 
; good random color palette.
; 
; In my opinion, the render time of under 6 minutes is a satis-
; factory time to wait for such a gaudy fractal image.  But others 
; may not share my opinion.  For convenience, the completed image 
; has been posted in GIF format on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Quite a few of the older FOTD images are also available there.
; 
; Tuesday was probably a pleasant day here at Fractal Central.  I 
; say probably because the morning was so foggy that the weather 
; was invisible.  In fact, one could barely see across the street. 
; But when the fog lifted, the temperature reached 57F 14C and the 
; fractal cats were mostly content.  They did get into one brief 
; squabble, but quickly forgot whatever misdeed had annoyed them.  
; Nicholas purred like a tiger as he enjoyed his evening treat of 
; cheddar cheese.  Cassie finished her tuna in silence.
; 
; My day was as pleasant as could be expected.  The work is caught 
; up and the FOTD fractal is an improvement over yesterday's.  The 
; next fractal will appear in 24 hours.  If all goes well, it will 
; be an improvement over today's image.  If not, it will still be 
; a good fractal.  Until then, take a little care.
