; FOTD -- November 30, 2006 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is unusual enough to earn a rating of a 9.  This 
; is one of the few times a FOTD image has garnered such a high 
; rating.  The image is a scene in the fractal that results when 
; various negative portions of Z^(-1.5) and Z^(-5.5) are combined 
; and (1/C) is added.
; 
; This parent fractal is a sprawling Mandeloid thing with four 
; near-equal main bays.  Today's scene is located rather deep in 
; one of the many valleys separating the bays.
; 
; To do something out of the ordinary, I first found a midget, 
; then I 'evaporated' the scene by raising the escape radius to 
; 10^100, which created a totally blank black screen.  I then 
; brought the blank screen back to life by rendering it with the 
; 'bof60' inside fill.  The active fill resurrected the ghost of 
; the dead midget and surrounded it with bubbles of the most 
; unusual shape.
; 
; The almost totally green color palette seems to work quite well 
; with today's scene.  I added only a few reddish highlights to 
; the high points of the bubbles.  The green colors inspired the 
; name "Avocado Eruption".  After a bit of consideration, I 
; decided that the image is striking enough to deserve a rating of 
; an exceptional 9.
; 
; One bad point of the image is its slowness.  It takes over 1-1/4 
; hours to calculate on my 200mhz machine, and will take close to 
; 20 minutes even on the hottest fireball machines.  But salvation 
; is at hand on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image is posted for instant viewing.
; 
; Gray dreary clouds accompanied by drizzle and a temperature of 
; 54F 12C kept a lid on the merriment here at Fractal Central on 
; Wednesday.  But the fractal cats do not depend on the weather to 
; bring them happiness.  They create their own high spirits.  They 
; kept themselves busy most all day by pulling the morning paper 
; from the table, scattering and wrecking it, then shredding the 
; remains.  By the time their evening treat was served, they were 
; thoroughly worn out, covered in confetti, and ready to eat.
; 
; My day was on the slow side, and with my bad ankle still 
; mending, I had the spare time needed to create today's unusual 
; image.  Tomorrow will likely be another slow day, which will 
; likely result in another pretty good FOTD.  Until then, take 
; care, and things are never so good that they can't get better.
