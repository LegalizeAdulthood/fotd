; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's fractal "The Way of an Eagle".  Don't ask why I 
; gave it this name, I have no idea.  It's a rather poetic name 
; however, which seems to fit the image quite well.
; 
; The generating formula mixes Z^(1.5) with 10 parts of Z^(0.1).  
; The parent fractal is a distorted Mandelbrot set that looks like 
; it was calculated with an escape radius so small that part of 
; the M-set is cut off.  Today's scene is located on the southern 
; shoreline of East Valley of this M-set.
; 
; The curvilinear effect was achieved by rendering the scene with 
; the outside set to 'tdis'.  Most of the other outside options 
; make fractals that are also attractive.
; 
; I pondered the situation for several minutes before deciding to 
; rate the image at a 7.  Though I found the image in under 5 
; minutes, it is unique enough to earn such a rating.
; 
; The 11-minute render time of the included parameter file is 
; slightly slow, but the image is worth the effort.  And it may 
; be viewed even faster by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image is posted in completed form.
; 
; A cold wet day with a temperature of 41F 5C here at Fractal 
; Central on Thursday spoiled most of the planned Thanksgiving Day 
; outdoor activities.  But the fractal cats do not celebrate 
; Thanksgiving, nor do they take part in outdoor activities, so 
; they had a rather pleasant day getting into mischief.  Nicholas 
; found a feather somewhere and played with it most of the 
; afternoon.  Cassie spent the afternoon curled by a radiator.
; 
; My day was slow, but the fractals were fast.  The next fractal 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and you may 
; already be a fractal winner.
