; FOTD -- November 12, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Beyond the Limits".  I gave it this name 
; because with its magnitude of almost 4*10^13 it goes beyond the 
; usual limits of conventional double-precision math.
; 
; The parent fractal came about when I mixed Z^2.2 with Z^4.8 and 
; added C.  There is a midget at the center of the image, but it 
; lies far beyond the limit of resolution.  We can only imagine 
; what it must look like.
; 
; The mathtolerance entry in the parameter file was necessary to 
; assure that the file calculates at the correct magnitude.  The 
; flat background came about when I raised the logmap to a value 
; far greater than necessary.
; 
; As for rating the image, I didn't bother.  I doubt that I'll 
; resume the FOTD image ratings until I'm back on my feet and 
; feeling my old self again, which I suspect will be 2 or 3 weeks 
; yet.
; 
; With its render time of 25 minutes, running the included parame-
; ter file is not the most efficient way of viewing the image.  
; The most efficient way is to visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the finished image posted there.
; 
; Another near perfect day here at Fractal Central on Saturday 
; (lots of sun and a temperature of 70F 21C) went un-noticed by 
; the fractal cats, who continued to amuse themselves exploring 
; the new row of bookshelves in the hallway.  They had so much fun 
; chasing each other over the shelves and behind the books that 
; they had to be called twice for their evening treats.
; 
; My day was frustrating.  On most days I have a positive attitude 
; about my incapacitation, but today I wanted to do so much and 
; was able to do so little that the frustration got the better of 
; me and I slipped into a funk.  But the fractals were still there 
; when I needed a diversion.  They are going nowhere.
; 
; The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours or so.  Until then, take 
; care, and there will be light for those who seek.
