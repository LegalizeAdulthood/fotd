; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's fractal image I have made an unlikely combination of 
; Z^1000 and Z^(0.01).  The resulting parent fractal consists of 
; little more than a ring with an eye-shaped oval inside.  Little 
; of interest would appear to exist in such a plain fractal.  But 
; let us check those rings a bit more carefully.
; 
; The most promising place to start is along the X-axis, and this 
; is where I found today's scene.  I named the image "Stained 
; Glass" because it reminds me of sunlight streaming through a 
; stained glass window.  The effect is so striking that I rated 
; the image at an 8.
; 
; The render time of one minute is fast enough to make the time 
; spent calculating the fractal seem insignificant.  The image 
; fairly flows onto the screen, and is finished almost before it 
; starts.  But as far as I know, time never flows in reverse, so 
; if one minute is too long a wait, the image may be seen on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The increasingly thick clouds and temperature of 41F 5C here at 
; New Fractal Central on Wednesday did not bother the fractal 
; cats, who spent a good part of the day sulking at each other.  
; I have no idea what happened between them, but whatever it was, 
; they had totally forgotten it by the time their evening treat 
; was served.
; 
; Except for the fractals, my day was boring.  It's hard to avoid 
; boredom when you're laid up with a bum leg and your other half 
; is doing all the work you should be doing.  My sister, who suf-
; fered the same kind of injury several years ago, said it took 
; her 2 to 3 months to really get back into shape.  Well, it's 
; been almost 6 weeks for me, so I guess I'm halfway there.  The 
; next in the unending line of fractals will appear in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and maintain vigilance.
