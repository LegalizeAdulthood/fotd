; FOTD -- November 05, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; My leg may be colored with the browns, purples and blacks of a 
; muddy piece of abstract art, but unlike today's image, there is 
; no Mandelbrot set hidden in the center.
; 
; Today's sinuous fractal lies in the parent fractal that results 
; when a little Z^(-1.1) is subtracted from some Z^(1.1) and (1/C) 
; is added.  The sinuous effect was achieved by rendering the 
; image with the outside set to 'real'.
; 
; I named the image "Casually Speaking" for no apparent reason.  I 
; gave it far too little effort to be worth a rating.  The brief 
; render time of 3-1/2 minutes will try the patience of no one, 
; especially when the finished image is viewed on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 39F 4C made things 
; pleasant enough outdoors here at Fractal Central on Saturday.  
; But indoors the air was filled with occasional 'thumps' as I 
; hobbled from room to room on my walker.  The fractal cats don't 
; quite know what to make of the device, and usually stay well out 
; of my way.  But when I settle into my easy chair and put the 
; walker aside for a while, they are soon there to check things 
; out.  I hear that such injuries take up to 8 weeks to heal in 
; vigorous young people, and I have not been one of them for quite 
; a while.  Well, all I can do for now is keep nursing my bum foot 
; and leg, and keep thumping around.  Unless another bout of the 
; blues comes on, and I start feeling sorry for myself, the next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and hop 
; with the bunnies.
