; FOTD -- November 17, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's extravagant fractal image lies in the parent fractal 
; that results when Z^2.5 is combined with lowly Z^0.13 and C is 
; added.  The addition of the near-unity element adds a bit of 
; surprise to the parent fractal.  Instead of the expected figure, 
; we see a twisted Mandeloid surrounded by most curious Mandeloid 
; holes.  Today's scene lies in a narrow bridge between two of 
; these suburban holes.
; 
; I gave the image no rating because I just don't think it's worth 
; one.  I named it "Much Extravagance" because that's what it has 
; -- too much intricate detail and no center of attention or over-
; all theme.  But it's still a pleasant picture to look at, and 
; who knows what secrets lurk in its depths.
; 
; The 13 minute cauculation time is barely within reason.  The 
; best way to see the image is to go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view it there.
; 
; Torrential rain flooded the Fractal Central area on Thursday, 
; while the temperature reached an un-fall-like 68F 20C.  The 
; fractal cats stopped their play long enough to watch the sheets 
; of rain blow by, then returned to their mischief.  They were 
; thoroughly satisfied when the evening treat time arrived.
; 
; In my department the work rush is calming down and my banged-up 
; leg is slowly on the mend.  But the fractals keep coming despite 
; the situation.  As an interesting side event, in the November 13 
; issue of Time Magazine I see a debate between Richard Dawkins, 
; an Atheist, and Francis Collins, a Christian Believer.  As expec-
; ted, the result is a deadlock.  But I would like to see a debate 
; between Mr. Dawkins and one who follows a more mystical tradi-
; tion, one without a supernatural personal god, such as Buddhism. 
; This leads me to wonder whether a person could honestly be both 
; an Atheist and a follower of Buddhism at the same time.  Be that 
; as it may, the next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and be at ease within yourself.
