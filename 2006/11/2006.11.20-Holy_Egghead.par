; FOTD -- November 21, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I named today's fractal image "Holy Egghead" because of the egg-
; shaped holes arranged in a circle around the central midget.  
; After a not-so-exhaustive study of the image, I decided it was 
; not worth a rating.
; 
; The parent fractal was generated by combining 1 part of Z^10 
; with 10 parts of Z^0.1 before adding C.  It resembles a twisted 
; Mandelbrot set, and lies some distance off the opening screen.
; 
; Some of the filaments extending from the buds of this remote set 
; terminate in large open holes rather than simply dying out.  
; Today's scene is located at the tip of a tiny filament extending 
; from the large hole at the end of the filament that extends from 
; the large period-3 south bud of the twisted M-set.
; 
; As the image stands, it is a rather striking fractal display.  
; But most of the excitement is generated by the strong coloring 
; with its intense contrasts.  Try a different color palette to 
; see the importance of the colors in creating the overall effect.
; 
; The render time of 2-1/4 minutes is quite speedy as fractals go. 
; It should try the patience of no one.  Those who do not render 
; may see the image by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing it there.
; 
; The cloudy, chilly weather continued unchanged here at Fractal 
; Central on Monday.  The temperature of 41F 5C meant nothing to 
; the fractal cats, who enjoyed an indoor temperature of 68F 20C. 
; They spent a good part of the day sitting on a table by the 
; living room window, watching the traffic pass by.  We have not 
; yet decided whether to eventually let them out, but so far they 
; seem perfectly happy simply looking through the window at the 
; forbidden wonderland beyond.
; 
; My day was acceptable.  The work is caught up and the fractals 
; are inexhaustible.  My injured ankle is progressing slowly but 
; surely.  It will be some time yet before it is as good as new 
; however.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and do something you've never done before.
