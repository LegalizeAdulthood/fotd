; FOTD -- November 27, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is found in the parent fractal that results when 
; one part of Z^101 is mixed with 100 parts of Z^(0.01) and C is 
; added.  This parent fractal is located far out of the usual 
; range, at -99 on the negative X-axis.  It is little more than a 
; series of vague circles with an active area with a tiny Mandel-
; oid on the east side.  This Mandeloid is rotated 180 degrees and 
; distorted in an indescribable way, but despite its distortion, 
; it holds many areas of interest.
; 
; Today's scene is located in a nest of ribbon-like shafts that 
; converge on the East Valley of the Mandeloid, which actually 
; lies on the west side of the main bay.  Seeing the potential 
; for ribbons in the initial fractal, I attempted to create a 
; color palette that would highten the impression of festive decor-
; ations.  It was successful enough to rate the result at a 7.
; 
; The name "Satin Ribbons" is self-explanatory.  The midget at the 
; center lies just beyond the limit of resolution, which is so 
; close to the actual magnitude of the image that it was necessary 
; to add the 'mathtolerance' entry to the parameter file to assure 
; that the image calculates at the correct magnitude.
; 
; And let's face it, the 16-minutes required to calculate the 
; image is a bit much for today's active fractalist to swallow.  
; Luckily, relief it at hand on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image has been calculated and posted for all fractal 
; fans to see and enjoy without delay.
; 
; Hazy skies and a mild temperature of 50F 10C made things rather 
; pleasant outdoors here at Fractal Central on Sunday.  The 
; fractal cats made things rather pleasant indoors when they 
; managed to get through the day without getting into mischief.  
; My day was about as pleasant as could be expected.  The next 
; FOTD, which will appear in 24 hours, will hopefully be equally 
; pleasant.
