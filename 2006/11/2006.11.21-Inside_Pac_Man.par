; FOTD -- November 22, 2006 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's curiously different fractal rates an honest 8.  It 
; resulted when I combined Z^100 with 40 parts of Z^(0.1) before 
; adding C, to produce a tiny Mandelbrot set.  The name "Inside 
; Pac-Man" came about when I saw this parent fractal.  Anyone 
; familiar with old computer games will recognize the familiar 
; Pac-Man shapes, which unfortunately lie far west of the opening 
; screen, at -39 on the X-axis.
; 
; The tiny Mandelbrot set of the parent fractal is surrounded by 
; clouds of fractal debris.  Today's scene is located in a bit of 
; this debris.  The sinuous effect is in the nature of the area, 
; though I emphasized it by calculating the image with the outside 
; set to 'summ'.  The other outside options give varying results 
; with today's image, with the 'fmod' option being perhaps the 
; most promising.
; 
; The calculation time of only 14 seconds can hardly be believed, 
; but with the passes set to 'b', it is the accurate time.  It 
; will take several times this long to go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and download the finished image from there.  But for those with 
; over-qualified computers, it may be the only way to see inside 
; the Pac-Man.
; 
; The sun shone brilliantly here at Fractal Central on Tuesday, 
; though the temperature remained at a chilly 39F 4C.  The sun 
; must have brought out the wickedness in the fractal cats, for 
; they managed one bit of trouble after another.  The turning 
; point came when they got into a tussle and knocked a lamp off 
; the table.  The lamp was unharmed, but the mischievous duo was 
; soundly scolded, (for all the good it did).
; 
; My day was routine in almost all aspects.  The next FOTD will 
; appear almost by magic in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; watch for signs of things to come.
