; FOTD -- November 14, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a blow-up of a tiny hole that was hidden nearly 
; invisibly in yesterday's image.  In my opinion, the picture is 
; good enough to deserve a rating, so after much consideration I 
; decided to give it a rating of 7.  I reused the color palette 
; that worked so well in yesterday's image.
; 
; After more consideration I named the image "Jewel in the Night". 
; There is something somber yet jewel-like about it.  And unlike 
; the midget in yesterday's haphazard image, the midget in today's 
; image is surrounded by its proper 2-4-8... series of fractal 
; elements.
; 
; Unfortunately, though the image is worthwhile, it is unusually 
; slow, taking almost 1-1/4 hours to complete on my machine.  This 
; is a bit too much time to ask anyone to spend on a fractal, but 
; there is a way out of the quardary.  I have sent the GIF file of 
; the finished image on ahead to Paul at the FOTD web site, where 
; it will soon be posted, ready for quick and easy viewing.
;

; 
; The rain moved out but the clouds hung on here at New Fractal 
; Central on Monday, while the temperature of 50F 10C gave an 
; unpleasant clammy feeling to the air.  The fractal cats did not 
; worry about the weather however.  They were still busy staking 
; claims to the new arrangement of bookshelves in the hallway.
; 
; My day was slow, but I am ready to start getting around with a 
; walking stick instead of a walker, and this will make everyday 
; things far easier to accomplish.  The next FOTD fractal will be 
; accomplished in around 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; will artificial-intelligence computers ever be able to dream 
; while they sleep?  If they do dream, how will we verify it?
