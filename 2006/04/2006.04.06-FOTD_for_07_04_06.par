; FOTD -- April 07, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's rather slow image lies in the fractal that results when 
; Z^(-0.5) is combined with Z^(-2.5) and (1/C) is added.  I gave 
; it no name and no rating, since I put so little effort into it.
; 
; The parent fractal is an oversized vaguely peanut-shaped thing, 
; or with a bit more imagination, it might be seen as an embryo.  
; Today's image is located on the east shoreline of the main bay, 
; near the point where the chaos merges into the more organized 
; area.
; 
; The image really could be given a rating, since, with its combi-
; nation of organization and chaos, it appears to be a little 
; above average.  But I'll hold off rating most of the FOTD images 
; until F.L. and I get ourselves settled into the New Fractal 
; Central, which will happen well before summer officially begins.
; 
; The render time of over 1/2 hour on my machine is on the slow 
; side, but relief is at hand on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image is posted ready for download.
; 
; BTW, I did find midgets in the 'Stuff' image of April 05.  They 
; are rather well concealed.  I was beat to the discovery by Lee 
; Skinner, but I'll still post one of the midgets I found as 
; tomorrow's FOTD.
; 
; A very pleasant spring day here at Old Fractal Central on 
; Thursday gave the fractal cats a full afternoon in the yard.  
; They enjoyed their time outside by sleeping.  My day continued 
; quite busy.  The next FOTD is due in 24 hours.  It actually 
; might appear when due.  Until next time, take care, and be one.
