; FOTD -- April 04, 2006 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Despite the paltry 6 minutes spent finding today's image, the 
; result rates an 8.  The parent fractal came about when I 
; subtracted 11(Z^2.1) from 11(Z^1.9) and added (C).  Today's 
; image appeared when I checked the spurious bay at the Elephant 
; Valley end of the main bay.
; 
; Though it took only 6 minutes to find today's image, it took 
; almost 1/4 hour to render the scene.  My suggestion is to 
; download the finished product from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; It really is a rather attractive fractal, consisting of half 
; inside and half outside.
; 
; Since we were away from Old Fractal Central all weekend, setting 
; up the soon-to-be New Fractal Central, I can not give a full 
; report on the fractal cats.  But my sister, who watched over 
; them while we were away, says they were as happy as aging cats 
; can be.  And I see she spared no tuna.  A hailstorm struck OFC 
; at 8pm Monday, sending the duo scurrying for cover behind the 
; cartons in the closet.  When the noisy storm moved off, the duo 
; re-appeared, none the worse for their fright.
; 
; For me, the work is starting to back up, making a regular 
; appearance of the FOTD questionable, but I'll do as good as I 
; can until the big move is accomplished sometime in May.  The 
; next FOTD is due in 24 hours.  Most likely, it will appear on 
; schedule.  But there is no guarantee.  Until whenever, take 
; care, and forge a new beginning.
