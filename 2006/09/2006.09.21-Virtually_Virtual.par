; FOTD -- September 22, 2006 (Not Rated)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The day started normally enough on Thursday here at F.C.  When 
; I checked my e-mail, I found that I had won three lotteries that 
; I did not buy tickets for, and I also needed to verify my identi-
; ty for three internet banking accounts that I do not have.  One 
; would doubt that anyone would actually fall for these scams, but 
; from the way they keep proliferating, it is hard to believe that 
; they totally fail to catch a few suckers.  Maybe I should start 
; selling certified authentic Mandelbrot sets.
; 
; Today's striking image consists almost entirely of 'inside' 
; stuff made visible by the 'bof61' fill.  It is another variation 
; of the strange rectangle in one of the Julia sets of the 
; Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid.  The orientation is rotated only one 
; degree toward the Elliptic plane, but the result is a very 
; unusual variation.
; 
; The rectangle is not really there.  When the inside is set to 
; the normal flat black, there is no sign of the rectangle.  It 
; has become a virtual rectangle.  But the rectangle was virtual 
; from the start, so now it has become virtually virtual, which is 
; what I named it.
; 
; The 'bof61' inside fill is not the only one that works with 
; today's image.  The 'fmod' fill also works quite well, and the 
; 'zmag' fill works reasonably well also.  The other inside fills 
; simply color the inside areas a flat color.
; 
; I did not rate the image, but if I had, it would probably have 
; earned a rating of 8 or 9.  The passes=b option not only works 
; fastest with the image, it is by far the most interesting one to 
; watch in action.  The render time of 9-1/2 minutes will be irrel-
; evant if the image is viewed on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Partly cloudy skies and a brisk high temperature of 68F 20C made 
; things reasonably pleasant for the fractal cats, who spent the 
; day indoors, unconcerned with the outside conditions.  The light 
; work load made my day pleasant also.  The next FOTD will appear 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and if someone offends a 
; fractal, expect no violent protest.  Fractals are very peaceful.
