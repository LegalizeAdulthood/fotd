; FOTD -- September 05, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Seahorse Valley never looked like this before.  The unexpected 
; shape inspired the name "Is This Seahorse valley?"  But the 
; image most certainly is one of Seahorse valley.  The scene is an 
; oblique view of the valley, rotated 13 degrees from the Julia 
; orientation toward the Rectangular orientation.  If anyone 
; doubts this, change real(p1) to 90 and watch the Seahorse Valley 
; Julia set appear.  And while you're at it, change poth parts of 
; (p1) to zero and watch Seahorse Valley itself appear at the 
; center of the screen, awkwardly rotated 90 degrees.
; 
; With all these unfamiliar aspects, what shape then is the entire 
; Seahorse Valley area of the Julibrot?  It is a tapering four-
; dimensional wedge that terminates in a sharp plane.  A sharp 
; plane would describe the razor edge that a 4-D man would use to 
; shave his chin, just as a 3-D man uses a blade with a sharp line 
; as the cutting edge.  Yes, I know it's silly to think that a 
; plane could be sharp, but the fourth dimension makes many imposs-
; ible things possible.  A sharp plane could extend indefinitely 
; in all directions, yet a 4-D man could cut himself seriously if 
; he carelessly touched it.
; 
; Thank goodness we can see our fractals only two dimensions at a 
; time.
; 
; The included parameter file of today's image runs in a little 
; over 1-1/2 minutes.  The image is also conveniently available 
; for download on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; I'll probably post a few more unexpected aspects of Seahorse 
; Valley before moving on to East Valley, which, if anything, is 
; even more varied than Seahorse Valley.
; 
; The weather turned quite pleasant here at New Fractal Central on 
; Monday, with warm sun and a temperature of 73F 23C.  The fractal 
; cats enjoyed the fine weather as they sat on their scratching 
; posts, soaking up the sun.  My day was reasonably quiet, but 
; that big job is still looming for later this week.  The job will 
; not arrive tomorrow however, so expect the next FOTD to be 
; posted on schedule in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and a 
; four dimensional man would probably cut himself in half if he 
; stepped on one of our sidewalks.
