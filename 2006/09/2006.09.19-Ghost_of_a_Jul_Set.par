; FOTD -- September 20, 2005 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image, which was created with the julzpower formula of 
; Fractint, takes us very close to the strange rectangle in one of 
; the Julia sets of the Z^2.003+C Mandeloid.  It takes us so close 
; in fact, that the ghostly shadow of the rectangle itself appears 
; at the center of the frame, rotated and distorted, and surroun-
; ded by apparent fractal ice floes.
; 
; The distortion is caused by the inexact exponent of Z, which is 
; set to 2.00312 rather than 2.003, and also by the value of C, 
; which has an imaginary part of 0.0003 added to the real part of 
; -1.7435.  These tiny changes make a major change in the appear-
; ance of the Julia rectangle, which is rapidly fading from sight, 
; and will soon vanish into the ether.
; 
; To add to the interest, I calculated the scene with the inside 
; set to 'fmod' and the outside set to 'summ'.  The 'fmod' fill 
; gives the inside parts of the image the effect if ice floes 
; floating on a body of water, while the 'summ' merely livens the 
; coloring of the outside parts.
; 
; I named the image "Ghost of a Julia Set" and rated it at a 7.  
; The render time of over 11 minutes is a bit slow, but the task 
; of rendering may be avoided by viewing the image on the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A shower in the morning led to a pleasant sunny afternoon here 
; at New Fractal Central on Tuesday, with a comfortable tempera-
; ture of 77F 25C.  The fractal cats were more eager to explore a 
; just-opened closet than to enjoy the sun coming in their window.
; 
; My day was a bit slow, but that was no problem, since it gave me 
; more time to work on the fractal agenda.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and where is the 
; real truth hiding?
