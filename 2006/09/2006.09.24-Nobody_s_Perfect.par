; FOTD -- September 25, 2006 (Not Rated)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is titled "Nobody's Perfect".  The body I am 
; referring to is myself.  I recently wrote that the strange 
; rectangle appears only in the Julia sets of the Z^(2.003)+C 
; Julibrot.  But today, just to be double sure, I carefully 
; checked the Mandelbrot aspect of the area.
; 
; Nobody could have been more surprised than me when I found the 
; near-perfect rectangles scattered everywhere.  To make things 
; even worse, there are Mandelbrot midgets in the area, surrounded 
; by empty rectangles.  All this goes to show that, just because I 
; have been writing the FOTD for over 9 years, makes me no expert 
; in the field of fractals, which remain unpredictable.  I doubt 
; that anyone including Mandelbrot himself could claim to know any 
; more than a tiny part of all there is to know about fractals.
; 
; Today's image shows a most curious feature, which almost looks 
; like a living figure.  It has round holes and rectangles every-
; where.  The quadratic midgets within it are not that difficult 
; to find, but I will show none until the month ends.  After all, 
; this is supposed to be a month without a midget.
; 
; The render time of 7-1/2 minutes may be ignored by visiting the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the GIF image of the scene there.
; 
; Sometimes it was cloudy here at New Fractal Central on Sunday, 
; and sometimes it was almost clear.  There were even a few drops 
; of rain in the morning.  But the temperature reached a pleasant 
; 75F 24C, and the fractal cats totally ignored it.  A friendly 
; cat tussle got a bit out of control at one point, but the duo 
; quickly made up.
; 
; My day was good enough.  With any luck, tomorrow will be the 
; same.  But I think that a rather sizable job might come in by 
; afternoon.  If all goes well, the FOTD will appear before the 
; job arrives.  Until next time, take care, and be of good cheer 
; even if your team lost the big game.
