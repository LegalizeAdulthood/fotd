; FOTD -- September 17, 2006 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the East Valley area of the large 
; midget on the complex negative X-axis of the Z^2.003 Mandeloid.  
; This is the area that looks like a railroad switching yard and 
; holds the curious Julia rectangle that I have featured so many 
; variations of as the FOTD.  We examine one of the holes found 
; there.
; 
; But today's image is not a Julia set, nor is it a Mandelbrot 
; midget.  It is an oblique view of a random hole, seen in one of 
; the countless double rotations half way between the Parabolic 
; and Rectangular directions.  Double rotation is necessary to 
; turn from one of these orientations to the other, since, like 
; the Julia and Mandelbrot orientations, their planes intersect 
; in only a single point.
; 
; I named the image "Fractal of Tomorrow".  This does not mean it 
; will appear a second time tomorrow; it means I rather consider 
; such images to be ahead of their time.  Then again I have heard 
; it claimed that, since I am still using a DOS fractal program, 
; my fractals are behind the times.  Regardless, I admire today's 
; image, and have rated it at an 8 accordingly.
; 
; The render time of just under two minutes on my 10-year-old 
; computer will be cut to under one minute on the latest DOS-able 
; fireballs.  But some current fireballs that choke on DOS will 
; take all eternity to finish the calculation.  Those with such 
; uptight machines can still view the image by going to the FOTD 
; web site, where it is posted.  They will also find this discus-
; sion posted there in annotated form.  The FOTD web site can be 
; accessed at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Slowly clearing skies and a temperature of 75F 24C made condi-
; tions quite pleasant here at New Fractal Central on Saturday.  
; The new fractal cats were not concerned with the weather.  They 
; cornered some invisible critter in the kitchen pantry and kept 
; watch over it for most of the afternoon.  The thing that was 
; annoying them must have escaped, for they had totally forgotten 
; it by treat time.
; 
; My day featured back-to-normal conditions, which I hope will 
; continue indefinitely.  The next FOTD image will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and try to help a fractal in need.
