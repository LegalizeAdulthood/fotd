; FOTD -- September 16, 2006 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; OK.  So today's FOTD is 8 hours late.  What of it?  If I needed 
; an excuse, I would point to the small but urgent job that came 
; in unexpectedly yesterday morning.  The missing FOTD discussion 
; is probably for the best, since I had a long statement about 
; reality planned for the Philofractal list, which would likely 
; have spoiled my already tarnished reputation.  (After all, 
; nothing upsets rational-thinkers more than the suggestion that 
; the foundation of their world view, the real physical world of 
; nature, might not be as real as advertised.)
; 
; As it is, we will have no philosophy today.  (It might come 
; later.)  We must settle for a brief description of today's 
; image, which is a view in the Oblate direction of a Seahorse 
; Valley.  But it is not the familiar valley.  To find today's 
; valley we must go to the large midget at -1.75 of the Mandelbrot 
; set and then find that midget's largest sub-midget, which is 
; located around -1.785 of the M-set.  Today's image shows a side 
; view of the Seahorse Valley of this sub-midget.
; 
; The scene was stretched in the vertical direction by a factor of 
; 30 to bring it to its state of viewability.  (Actually, this is 
; measured by a compression factor of 0.033 in the horizontal 
; direction.)  If the image were not manipulated, we would see 
; nothing more than a series of featureless horizontal stripes.
; 
; I gave the result a rather surreal name -- "Circle with Horns".  
; That's what I see when I look at it.  I rated the image at a 5.  
; It had far too little effort put into it to rate anything 
; higher.  Rendering the image will demand very little valuable 
; time.  The included parameter file finishes in 27 seconds.  The 
; unlucky ones with over-qualified computers can find the image on 
; the fotd web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Things got unexpectedly very busy here at New Fractal Central 
; on Friday, with a job that had to be delivered by the week-end.  
; The fractal cats became sulky when they got too little atten-
; tion.  They didn't concern themselves with the mostly cloudy day 
; and the occasional light showers.  Toward sunset a perfect rain-
; bow formed in the east, which went completely un-noticed by the 
; duo, who were chasing each other madly up and down the long hall-
; way at the time.
; 
; In my department, the job was finally finished and delivered.  
; And nothing more is in sight, at least at the moment.  It looks 
; like the next FOTD will appear in around 16 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and be glad you are real.  (Or are you?)
