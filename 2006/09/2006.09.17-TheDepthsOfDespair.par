; FOTD -- September 18, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I promised that September would be a month without a quadratic 
; Mandelbrot midget.  And my promise remains unbroken.  Yes, I 
; realize that a hole of sorts must lie at the center of today's 
; image, but it is totally invisible, lying far beyond the range 
; of conventional math, and even if we could reach it, the midget 
; would look nothing like a miniature Mandelbrot set.
; 
; The scene is located in a twisting and spiraling, cut-off fila-
; ment of the Z^(1.15)+C Mandeloid as it appears 115 levels up the 
; logarithmic ladder.  Midgets are quite difficult to find in 
; Mandeloids of such a low order, and were it not for the 'fmod' 
; inside fill, I would likely have never found the one that lies 
; invisibly at the center of today's image.
; 
; I named the image "The Depths of Despair".  After all, I know of 
; no law that says fractals must always be cheerful.  The image is 
; really not all that gloomy however.  True, it holds a lot of 
; blue, but the brilliant white highlights add a kind of sparkling 
; vivacity that chases away the blues and brings a ray of hope.
; 
; The rating of 7 reflects how I feel about the image.  The extra 
; effort I put into the coloring raises the otherwise average 
; scene to an above-average one.  The render time of 4-3/4 minutes 
; may be eliminated by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the image there.
; 
; A damp and foggy morning gave way to a brilliantly sunny after-
; noon here at New Fractal Central on Sunday.  The temperature 
; reached 77F 25C, but the fractal cats were more interested in 
; finding mischief than watching the weather.  Cassie managed to 
; overturn a waste basket and spread the contents across the 
; floor.  And I'm not so sure Nicholas was as innocent as he 
; pretended.
; 
; My day was pleasantly quiet.  Hopefully, more of the same will 
; follow.  The next FOTD is near certain to follow in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and be at one with the object of your 
; choice.
