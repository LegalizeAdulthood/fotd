; FOTD -- September 03, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's colorful image is another unfamiliar view of Seahorse 
; Valley, which appears as the straight-edged bluish horizontal 
; band extending nearly the full width of the frame.  If the 
; Mandelbrot set were expanded to include the part of the Julibrot 
; extending behind and in front of the screen along the real-Z 
; axis, today's view would be looking down from above.  (Yester-
; day's view was looking from the left.)  Being a four-dimensional 
; object, Seahorse Valley has more different views than can be 
; imagined.  And even when all the views have been studied, the 
; viewer will have no better idea of the actual overall shape of 
; the valley than he did at the start.
; 
; Four-dimensional objects are not mere everyday three-dimensional 
; objects with extra complex shapes.  They are totally and 
; absolutely different.  The most basic feature of 4-D things is 
; that their surfaces are three-dimensional, with 3-D volume.  
; When looking at the surface of an opaque 4-D object, a 4-D man 
; would see a 3-D volume projected onto his 3-D retinas.  When 
; observing a 4-D hypersphere, he would see what we would consider 
; every point on the inside of a normal 3-D sphere.
; 
; Rotation in four dimensions is about a plane as axis, and a 4-D 
; object may be subject to two totally independent rotations 
; simultaneously, with the gyroscopic effect of one rotation 
; having no effect on the other rotation.  All this is entirely 
; unimaginable, but may easily be confirmed with mathematics.
; 
; I named today's image "Seahorse Valley-02".  I rated it at a 6.  
; The render time of 1-1/2 minutes is brief enough to cause no 
; one impatience.  But the image has been posted anyway to the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy rain fell all day here at New Fractal Central on Saturday. 
; The fractal cats watched with some interest for a few minutes, 
; then got about their normal cat business.  My day was accept-
; able.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and step likely.
