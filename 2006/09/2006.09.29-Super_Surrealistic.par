; FOTD -- September 30, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD is really for the 30th of the month.  Yesterday's 
; FOTD was dated the 30th, but it actually was the FOTD for the 
; 29th.  I must have been groggy when I lost track of the actual 
; date.  There was no FOTD for the 28th.
; 
; Oh, that poor Z^(2.003)+C rectangle.  What a series of convolu-
; tions it was put through!  In today's image we see it as a dis-
; torted, apparently melting picture frame that consists totally 
; of 'inside' stuff and therefore doesn't really exist.  But the 
; rectangle that is not really there is filled with semi-random 
; debris, made visible by the 'bof61' inside fill.  Not all of the 
; image is inside stuff however.  Set the inside to 'numb' to see 
; which is which.
; 
; The orientation of the slice is within four degrees of the Julia 
; direction.  This Julia aspect may be seen by changing the first 
; three parameters to 90.  As expected, when this is done, the 
; melting picture frame contracts into a near but not quite 
; perfect rectangle.  I have not followed the picture-frame very 
; far from the Julia orientation, but I doubt that it continues to 
; any of the other five perpendicular orientations.
; 
; I named the picture "Super Surrealistic".  Surreal means more 
; real than real, so it is anybody's guess what super surreal 
; might mean.  I gave it this name because the melting frame 
; reminds me of the famous melting watches.  Since I'm not sure 
; what I think of the scene, I gave it no rating.  If I had, it 
; would have probably rated about a 7.
; 
; The calculation time of just under 4 minutes will make no one 
; unhappy, unless, that is, they don't care very much about frac-
; tals.  But even those whose interest in fractals is fleeting 
; will enjoy the melting fractal picture frame when they can view 
; it without effort on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Partly cloudy skies, chill breezes and a temperature of 59F 15C 
; here at New Fractal Central on Friday bothered the fractal cats 
; not at all.  They spent most of the day being mad at each other 
; for something that happened yesterday.  But it is hard for cats 
; to hold a grudge more than one day, so by the time their treats 
; of cheese and tuna were served, the quarrel had been forgotten.
; 
; My day went rather smoothly.  The day's fractal turned out good 
; enough, so I guess I have no cause for complaint.  The next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until the time of celebration arrives, 
; take care, and watch your iterations.
