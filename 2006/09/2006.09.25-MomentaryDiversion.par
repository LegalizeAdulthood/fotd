; FOTD -- September 26, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The expected rush job has arrived, so I will need to keep 
; today's discussion brief.
; 
; Today's scene is a slice of the Z^(2.000001)+C Julibrot, cut at 
; an oblique angle through the East Valley of the large Midget on 
; the Mandelbrot main stem.  The tiny hole at the center is broken 
; into two parts.  In the Mandelbrot plane, the hole appears as a 
; quadratic midget, with part of a second midget nearby, exactly 
; as is the case with the hole at the center of today's scene..
; 
; In this area of the parent mandeloid fractal, the negative spike 
; is infinitely divided, though much enlargement is necessary 
; before this division becomes visible.  Today's scene lies at the 
; edge of the nest of spikes.
; 
; I did not give the image a rating but I did give it a name.  I 
; named it "Momentary Diversion" because I found it almost in a 
; moment.  There was no surprise involved.  I knew from the begin-
; ning that I would find this scene.
; 
; The render time of just over 5 minutes may be dispensed with by 
; going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the full image there.
; 
; Things started slow but soon got busy here at New Fractal 
; Central on Monday.  With lots of sun and a temperature of 68F 
; 20C, the weather was near perfect, but the fractal cats, who got 
; too little attention to fill their needs, were too sulky to 
; notice it.
; 
; For me things were again hectic.  I just managed to finish the 
; FOTD.  The next in the unending series of FOTD's is scheduled to 
; appear in 24 hours or so.  It might be a brief one, but I am 
; reasonably sure that when the time comes it will be there.  
; Until then, take care, and walk with the birds.
