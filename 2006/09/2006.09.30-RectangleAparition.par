; FOTD -- October 01, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Nobody's prefect.  Not even myself.  I was surprised when 
; someone actually caught the intentional mis-spelling in my 
; recent note.  Fractalists are sharp indeed.  It's what happens 
; to those who think about numbers too many times.
; 
; Today is October 01, the day quadratic midgets are permitted to 
; reappear.  And I wasted no time.  The image for the day shows a 
; midget in the East Valley area of the large midget on the main-
; stem complex of the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid.  This is the area 
; of the Julibrot where the curious Julia rectangle is located.
; 
; The train-tracks that criss-cross the area are obvious.  And if 
; you look carefully around the midget, you will find eight tiny 
; copies of the great Julia rectangle itself.  At first glance the 
; Mandelbrot rectangles seem to be perfect copies of the Julia 
; rectangles, but a bit of experimenting shows a significant dif-
; ference in their interior structure.
; 
; The Julia rectangles stay almost fixed in position as the value 
; of C is changed, while they fill in and their shape undergoes 
; rapid transformation.  The Mandelbrot rectangles zoom out of 
; sight off the screen with the slightest change in the value of 
; Z, but when they are finally found, it is seen that they are 
; still open and their shape has remained largely unchanged.
; 
; The reason for this lies in the peculiar four-dimensional geome-
; try of the rectangles.  I will not try to describe this geometry 
; until I can actually visualize an entire tesseract in a single 
; moment of time.  I do not expect to be able to do this for quite 
; a while yet.
; 
; The rating of a 7 for today's image seems about right.  The name 
; "Rectangle Apparition" has the slight hint of the mystical that 
; is suggested by the entire world of fractals.  The render time 
; of 17-1/2 minutes borders on slowness, but the result is worth 
; the wait, and no waiting at all will be needed if the finished 
; image is viewed on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A cool cloudy drizzly day with a temperature of 55F 13C here at 
; New Fractal Central on Saturday kept the fractal cats confined 
; indoors.  But since they never go out anyway, they were uncon-
; cerned.  They had one moment of excitement however, when a mouse 
; popped out and scurried down the hallway.  The would be mouse-
; catchers fell over each other in pursuit.  The mouse got away 
; through a hole by a radiator pipe, having learned its lesson.  
; The duo watched the hole for over an hour, but the mouse never 
; re-appeared.  When they finally lost interest, I praised them 
; for their vigilance and gave them an extra treat.
; 
; My day was reasonably pleasant.  The work is up-to-date, nothing 
; big is in sight, and the fractals are going well enough.  What 
; else could a fractalist want, other than the answer to the ques-
; tion of the meaning of existence?  The next FOTD will appear in 
; 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and does meaninglessness reign 
; supreme?  If it does, what is the meaning of it.  Or is the 
; very concept of meaning a creation of human thought processes?
; 
; I wonder.
