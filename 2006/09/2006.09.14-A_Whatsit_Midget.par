; FOTD -- September 15, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a most curious fractal hole.  But it most 
; certainly is not a Mandelbrot midget.  And it certainly is not a 
; Julia set, though it does have some Julia characteristics.  Nor 
; is it an Elliptic set, a Rectangular set, a Parabolic set, or an 
; Oblate set.  It is actually a set in a slice oriented about half 
; way between the Parabolic and Elliptic directions.
; 
; As the value of the center point of today's image indicates, the 
; scene is located in the vicinity of the large midget located at 
; -1.75 of the Mandelbrot set.  Since we are exploring 4-D space 
; when we examine the Julibrot, it is impossible to describe the 
; exact direction from the -1.75 midget in which today's scene 
; lies.
; 
; The thin straight yellow line at the edge of the solid inner 
; area is actually one of the Mandelbrot valleys of the large 
; -1.75 midget sliced from the side.  It seems counter-intuitive 
; that, from the side, a Mandelbrot valley should appear as a 
; straight line, but the Mandelbrot aspect of the Julibrot is 
; actually shaped like a nest of 4-D hypercylinders, which, like 
; 3-D cylinders, appear straight when sliced parallel to their 
; length.
; 
; I named today's image "A Whatsit Midget" because I have no idea 
; what else I might name it.  The rating of a 6 seems about right 
; for an image that is more a mathematical curiosity than an 
; artistic triumph.  The render time of a little over 1/2 minute 
; should make the task of rendering almost enjoyable.  And the job 
; of rendering may be eliminated entirely by viewing the finished 
; image on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy clouds, fog on the hills, occasional rain, and a tempera-
; ture of only 63F 17C made conditions far less than ideal here at 
; New Fractal Central on Thursday.  But the fractal cats, who can 
; look outside but are not permitted to go there, do not concern 
; themselves with mundane things like weather.  They spent the day 
; searching for trouble.  Luckily, they failed to find much of it.
; 
; My day was near normal, and it looks as though the next week or 
; so will remain uneventful.  One of these days I'm going to give 
; up graphic design work and start earning my living by selling 
; fractals.  Oh well, we can dream, can't we?  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and the secrets of 
; the universe may be hidden in these fractals -- if only we had 
; the key to unlock the secret door.
