; FOTD -- September 10, 2006  (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal Visionaries and Enthusiasts:
; 
; The big rush is in full swing, but I still found a few minutes 
; for a trip to East Valley to see the elephants as they have 
; never been seen before.  We are actually viewing the pachyderms 
; from the Oblate direction, which is the plane determined by the 
; imag(c) and real(z) axes of the Julibrot.  I named this orienta-
; tion Oblate because when the Jilibrot is sliced through its 
; origin in this direction, an oblate open area appears.
; 
; In this particular orientation, the elephants are not just 
; sitting there, guarding their buds.  They are running as though 
; fleeing a brush fire.  As they near the right edge of the image, 
; they scrunch themselves up and dive down out of sight, eventual-
; ly losing all resemblance to elephants and curving around to 
; become part of the goofy eyes of the Julia sets of East Valley.
; 
; The straight line across the image around the elephants' feet is 
; what I call a bridge.  These straight-edged features never 
; appear in Mandelbrot or Julia sets, but they are quite common in 
; the sets of the four odd planes of the Julibrot.  I have no time 
; right now to explain why they are so straight, but I will do so 
; when the rush subsides.
; 
; Inamed the image "Elephant Run" because I imagined I saw running 
; elephants in it.  I rated it at a 5 because I put so little 
; effort into it.
; 
; As for the fractal cats, they are doing fine, though wondering 
; why they are getting so little attention.  If the work keeps 
; moving, the next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  If not, look for 
; it on the following day.  Until whenever, take care, and even 
; thinking about the fourth dimension can be hazardous to your 
; health.
