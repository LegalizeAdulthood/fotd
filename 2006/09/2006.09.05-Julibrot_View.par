; FOTD -- September 06, 2006 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's final visit to Seahorse Valley is a bit overwhelming, 
; showing both the familiar Julia set and Seahorse Valley itself 
; in the same image.  The outer shell of the fractal is the Julia 
; set of Seahorse Valley, while the interior stuff is the valley 
; itself, grossly enlarged and seen from an angle which is double-
; rotated less than 1 degree from the Julia direction.  The two 
; branches of Seahorse Valley can be plainly seen converging on 
; the center of the image.
; 
; Don't try to visualize how it can be this way.  It's the path 
; to mental congestion.  Even a four-dimensional student studying 
; four-dimensional geometry would have trouble with it.  The 
; enlarged and distorted view of the valley involves hyperangles 
; with two independent arc measurements between planes that inter-
; sect in a single point.  It's hard enough to visualize a hyper-
; sphere, much less the whole convoluted Julibrot.
; 
; I rated the image at an 8.  In my opinion, it's worth it.  The 
; colors were pretty much a happy accident, but being the creating 
; fractalist, I can take any credit.  (As well as some occasional 
; blame.)
; 
; The name "Julibrot View" is a simple description.  The render 
; time of 28 minutes with passes=t may be cut in half by calculat-
; ing the parameter file with passes=g, but the price is the loss 
; of some detail.  The passes=b option finishes in 1 second, but 
; misses the entire image.  The passes=1 option captures every 
; last speck of detail, but takes over an hour to do it.
; 
; The passes=t version has been posted to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; from where it may be conveniently downloaded.
; 
; Heavy clouds and occasional light rain did not concern the new 
; fractal cats, who glanced out the window once or twice between 
; bouts of play.  When they finished their evening treats of tuna 
; and cheese, I told them that they will soon be world famous with 
; their pictures posted on the FOTD web site.  They continued to 
; wash their faces.
; 
; With the work still up to date, I was not concerned either.  But 
; the potential still exists for a rush job to come in around 
; Thursday.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours, and will take 
; us to East Valley to check the elephants that live there.  Until 
; then, take care, and be fondly optimistic.
