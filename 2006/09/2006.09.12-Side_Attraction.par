; FOTD -- September 13, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The continuing rush on Tuesday meant anther hurried FOTD image.
; 
; Today's rather unusual scene is a feature of the Julibrot.  It 
; is located some distance to the viewer side of the large midget 
; at -1.75,0 of the Mandelbrot set.  It is sliced in he Oblate 
; direction, which is the orientation determined by the real(z) 
; and imag(c) axes of the Julibrot.
; 
; I named the image "Side Attraction" because it is located to the 
; side of the Mandelbrot set.  I rated it at a 6 because it is 
; just interesting enough and colored well enough to deserve that 
; rating.
; 
; The render time of under 1 minute means that those who rendered 
; the image themselves and are disappointed by it, will not have 
; wasted much computer time.  Those who don't render may find the 
; image already rendered on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The cloudy, chilly weather here at New Fractal Central on 
; Tuesday, with a temperature of only 63F 17C, worried the fractal 
; cats not the least.  They are showing all signs of being 
; permanent indoor cats, which is the healthiest, but perhaps not 
; the happiest life for a cat to lead.  In the evening, they 
; romped and enjoyed their treats of tuna and cheese.
; 
; For me, the current rush is rapidly coming to a close.  The 
; current one went well enought, but I hope these rushes don't 
; come too often.  I fear I'm getting too old for this kind of 
; stuff.  The next FOTD is quite likely to appear as scheduled in 
; 24 hours.  Until that glorious moment, take care, and philoso-
; phize mightily.
