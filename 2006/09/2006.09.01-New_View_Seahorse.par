; FOTD -- September 02, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today we come face to face with the monster that has been 
; lurking in the background of nearly every fractal image I have 
; posted -- the abstract but strangely real four-dimensional 
; fractal object known as the Julibrot.
; 
; The Julibrot must be four-dimensional.  It is created by 
; reiterating two complex numbers, and complex numbers have two 
; parts.  2+2=4.  But what is the fourth dimension?  In the theory 
; of relativity, time is the fourth dimension, but in the Julibrot 
; a fourth spatial dimension exists, meaning that for the 
; Julibrot, time is the fifth dimension.
; 
; So what is the fourth spatial dimension?  In sci-fi stories we 
; sometimes hear of creatures visiting earth from the fourth or 
; fifth or whatever dimension.  These fantasy higher dimensions 
; are not true higher dimensions.  They are merely alternate 
; parallel universes of three dimensions, like our own universe.  
; 
; The true fourth spatial dimension is a line simultaneously 
; perpendicular to every line we could draw in our 3-space.  Such 
; a direction is absolutely unimaginable, almost like there were 
; some kind of impenetrable mental wall blocking our visualizing 
; ability.  Yet we can explore 4-space with mathematics as easily 
; as we explore the familiar three-dimensional space of everyday 
; experience.
; 
; I will have much to say in the next month about the wonders and 
; seemingly impossible features of 4-D objects and 4-D space.  But 
; for now it's time to get to today's image.  
; 
; Today's image is an Oblate view of that warhorse of all fractal 
; objects -- Seahorse Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  Yes, I 
; realize that the image has no resemblance to Seahorse Valley or 
; its Julia sets, but the thing in the image, which somewhat 
; resembles a party mask, truly is Seahorse Valley, and a lot 
; more of it than we normally see, at that.  I will show another 
; totally new view of Seahorse Valley in tomorrow's FOTD, and 
; explain how the images were produced.
; 
; I rated today's image at a 6, which is slightly above average.  
; The scene has appeared before, but the coloring of today's 
; version is about as good as I have ever seen, justifying the 
; rating.
; 
; The image renders in 14 seconds, one of the all-time fastest, 
; and fast enough for the most impatient.  Those with Fractint 
; deprived computers may see the image by downloading it from the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A cloudy and unseasonably chilly morning here at Fractal Central 
; on Friday gave way to a rainy afternoon.  The fractal cats were 
; not bothered by the bad weather.  They spent the day indoors, by 
; the window, watching the wet birds and squirrels outside, and 
; wishing they could go out to get wet.
; 
; My day was average, whatever that means.  I expect tomorrow to 
; be another average day.  Hopefully, the FOTD, which will appear 
; in 24 hours, will be above average.  Until then, take care, and 
; don't doubt the new fractal cats.  I have a good picture of them 
; sitting on their window sill, and I will soon send it to be 
; posted on the FOTD web site.
