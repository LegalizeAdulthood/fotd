; FOTD -- September 27, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image we make a quick return to the MandelbrotBC2 
; formula to check a scene in the Z^(1.2)+C Mandeloid as it 
; appears 12 levels up the infinite complex logarithmic spiral.
; 
; I assume that a midget or a hole of some sort lies at the center 
; of today's image.  But even if it is a bottomless pit in the 
; image, the scene is still attractive enough with its lilac and 
; blue tones and its lightning-like filaments circling the 
; depression.
; 
; Since the image is another almost-automatic one, I did not give 
; it a rating.  The name I chose, "Lilac Icefall", came to me as a 
; whim.  I really see little in the picture to remind one of a 
; mass of shattered blocks of ice.
; 
; The passes=b option works best with today's image, and it is 
; also the fastest.  The 1-1/2 minute render time should try the 
; patience of only those with handicapped computers.  For conven-
; ience, the finished image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The partly cloudy weather on Tuesday with a temperature of 75F 
; 24C made no impression on the fractal cats here at New Fractal 
; Central.  They were more interested in chasing invisible crit-
; ters up and down the hallway.  (I would like to see them catch 
; one of the things they chase, so we could see what it is.)  When 
; the cats failed to catch anything, they satisfied themselves 
; with their faces in their food dishes.
; 
; My day was very busy.  The job is about half finished.  From the 
; rate things are moving, I cannot guarantee an FOTD for tomorrow 
; (actually I never can) but I'll see what I can do.  I'll give a 
; 67-percent chance that an FOTD of some sort will actually 
; appear.  Until next time, in 24 or 48 hours, take care, and 
; don't get frustrated if your fractal will not iterate.
