; FOTD -- May 26, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's unscheduled FOTD is an extra one.  I posted it to let 
; everyone know that the FOTD is in no danger of coming to an end. 
; But there is still a long way to go before things will be under 
; control here at New Fractal Central.  Fractal Lady is worrying 
; herself to distraction trying to decide how to arrange the 
; furniture in the new larger house.  I keep telling her to put 
; the tables and chairs on the floor and hang the pictures on the 
; walls, but when she does this, it never seems to work out.  At 
; least fractals are not so complicated.
; 
; Today's un-named and un-rated image is a hastily found scene 
; in the fractal that results when 0.1 part of Z^(-15.5) is 
; subtracted from Z^(-1.6) and (1/C) is added.  The special 
; effects were created by the outside=tdis option.
; 
; The render time of 18-1/2 minutes is not too bad, and hopefully 
; the finished GIF image is or soon will be posted to the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather was cloudy and mild here at New Fractal Central on 
; Thursday.  I hear it was about the same back at Old Fractal 
; Central, where my sister gave the old fractal cats a great day 
; in the yard.  Since total confusion still reigns supreme here, 
; the next FOTD will not appear until about June 1, when things 
; should be at least on the road to normalcy.  Until then, take 
; care, and where did we pack the remote controls for the elec-
; tronic devices?
