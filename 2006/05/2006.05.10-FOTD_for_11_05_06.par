; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; How could one rate a regular pentagon?  They could not.  A penta-
; gon is unratable.  All regular pentagons are similar.  They're 
; all the same.  Therefore I gave today's image, which features a 
; blatantly obvious pentagon, no rating.  True, the pentagon is 
; decorated by flowery petals, but it is still a pentagon.
; 
; The parent fractal was created by combining small portions of 
; Z^(-0.5) and Z^(-1.5) then adding (1/C).  It consists of several 
; oversized arcs floating in empty space.  Today's scene is 
; located in the smaller arc, which has by far the most detail.
; 
; When I examined this smaller arc, I found no signs of Mandelbrot 
; midgets, but hey, there's nothing wrong with the pentagons that 
; I did find, a great example of which appears in today's picture.
; 
; The passes=b option works exceptionally well with today's image, 
; and it is quite amusing when the outline of the perfect pentagon 
; is suddenly traced out.
; 
; The render time of just under 3 minutes is fair enough, but to 
; speed things up even more, the finished picture of the pentagon 
; has been posted to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather was perfect here at Old Fractal Central on Wednes-
; day; the fractal cats were perfect also.  My day was appropri-
; ately busy.  The next FOTD is scheduled to appear in 24 hours.  
; It actually might do so.  Until then, take care, and if you 
; actually did find the theory of everything, it would still be 
; nothing but a theory.
