; FOTD -- February 11, 2006 (Rating 9)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Many years ago I posted a FOTD which illustrated a fractal tree 
; covered with snow.  That image is still one of my favorites.  
; Today's image is a near repeat of that 9-year-old image.
; 
; The image is a Julia set of the Z^(1.5)+C Mandeloid as it 
; appears PI levels up the logarithmic spiral, or more accurately 
; at ground level of the spiral.
; 
; When studying the image, I had the impression of a tree covered 
; with a thin coating of ice, such as might be deposited by 
; freezing rain.  I named the image "Freezing Rain".
; 
; Since the image really is quite striking, I decided to give it a 
; rating of an impressive 9.  The render time of under 2 minutes 
; means that no one will become impatient while running the 
; parameter file.
; 
; Impatience may be totally eliminated by downloading the 
; completed GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Slightly milder weather here at Old Fractal Central on Friday 
; gave the fractal cats almost two hours in the holly patch.  
; While the cats were lurking there, a flock of about 100 robins 
; descended on the holly trees to feast on the ripe berries.  The 
; dynamic duo chattered at the birds but decided not to stalk 
; them.  My day was once again quite busy.  Unless something goes 
; very wrong, the next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and search for divinity.
