; FOTD -- February 07, 2006 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a scene on the eastern side of the north 
; branch of Seahorse Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  The associated 
; radical has a periodicity of 23.  As has often been the case 
; recently, I have given the image neither name nor rating.  Per-
; haps the most incredible thing about today's fractal is the fact 
; that a unique scene can be found so quickly in such a well-
; explored parent fractal.
; 
; On my 2300mhz fireball unit, the image renders in well under one 
; minute.  On the 10-year-old 200mhz unit it takes 6-3/4 minutes.  
; Regardless of the render time, the completed image may be seen 
; almost immediately by downloading it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The deed has been done and I'm back at the fractal machine.  The 
; New Fractal Central has been purchased and paid for, and we are 
; waiting only for the present residents to move out before moving 
; from the Old Fractal Central forever.  My sister has agreed to 
; move into Old Fractal Central when we move out, and live there 
; until the two fractal cats depart this world.  The dynamic duo 
; are near 16 years old, and are so set in their ways that we will 
; not upset them by moving them.  This means we will be choosing 
; two new fractal cats in the near future.  And yes, I will post 
; pictures of the old fractal cats, Thomas and Tippy, before we 
; move away from Old Fractal Central.  I'll probably pick up a 
; throw-away camera to take the photos.
; 
; A sunny, brisk and breezy day on Monday here at Old Fractal 
; Central kept the fractal cats close to home.  My day was very 
; busy as I tried to catch up the overdue work.  The next FOTD 
; has an 85-percent chance of appearing in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and is the illusion of reality really real?
