; FOTD -- February 12, 2006 (Not Rated)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image illustrates several of those overlapping midgets 
; that I find so interesting.  But these overlapping fractals are 
; natural.  They are not layers created artificially by the 
; program.  And BTW, it *is* possible for Fractint to create 
; fractals consisting of two layers, though I have never used 
; this feature.
; 
; The image was created by adding (1/Z) to half as much Z^(1.3), 
; then adding C.  I gave the image no name and no rating.  I could 
; find nothing in it worth a name or a rating.  The render time of 
; 1-1/4 hours on my ancient fractal machine will be reduced to 
; well under one hour on the newer units, but this is still quite 
; slow for such an unimpressive image, so to make things more 
; convenient, I have sent the finished image on ahead to Paul at 
; the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where it is available for instant viewing.
; 
; Cloudy chilly weather in the morning and light wet snow in the 
; afternoon kept the fractal cats indoors all day Saturday.  The 
; snow grew heavier as night fell, so I doubt they will have much 
; quality outdoor time for several days.  My day was kept quite 
; busy with odds and ends.  If all goes well, the next FOTD will 
; appear in all its unglory in 24 hours.  Until that unglorious 
; moment arrives, take care, and look for light.
