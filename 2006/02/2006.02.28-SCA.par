; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; You know things are bad when you get the remnants of an e-mail 
; 'phishing' scam from the philofractal list.  Believe it or not, 
; this is what I received a day or so ago.  At least the sender 
; did not try to convince me that I had won a fractal lottery that 
; I had never entered.
; 
; I named today's image "SCA".  I leave it to the fractalist to 
; decide what the letters stand for.  Two possible things are 
; 'small craft advisory' and 'sickle-cell anemia', neither of 
; which has much to do with fractals.
; 
; What *does* have something to do with fractals is the formula 
; Z^(1.5)+C as it appears 555 levels up the endless logarithmic 
; ladder.  The Mandeloid at this level is little more than a 
; roughly circular bay, with few buds that might add interest, but 
; its Julia sets are far more interesting.
; 
; Today's image is the Julia set of an inconspicuous valley of the 
; Mandeloid.  It is a rather unique image, shaped something like a 
; comma turned sideways, which is why I decided to give it a kind 
; of name and a rating of 7.
; 
; The calculation time of under 3 minutes will make running the 
; included parameter file an easy task.  Those who do not or can 
; not run Fractint parameter files may see the image by downloading 
; it from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A slightly milder temperature of 41F 5C and a partly cloudy sky 
; here at Old Fractal Central on Tuesday were not quite enough to 
; please the fractal cats, who were outside only a few minutes 
; before coming in to ask for extra tuna.  My days continue incred-
; ibly busy, but not so busy as to preclude fractals.  The next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and the 
; world may exist only in the mind, but if so, where is the mind?
