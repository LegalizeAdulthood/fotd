; FOTD -- February 22, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The time grows ever nearer to switch home base from the familiar 
; but deteriorating Old Fractal Central location to the New 
; Fractal Central with its unknown potential.  The exact date of 
; transition has not yet been determined, but as things stand now, 
; it will be sometime between April 1 and May 31.
; 
; Today's image in the Mandelbrot set is good enough to earn a 
; rating of 7, which is something for an image to be proud of, 
; especially at a time when ratings are scarce.  I could have 
; given the image a name, but I decided not to.
; 
; The scene is located in the East Valley of a tiny midget on the 
; negative stem of the M-set.  The midget is located fairly close 
; to the point where the stem joins the main body of the set, 
; which is why the image is filled with so much sandy chaos.
; 
; On my high-speed fireball computer the parameter file runs in 10 
; seconds.  The tired old computer chugs along on the calculation 
; for over 2-3/4 minutes.  The image downloads from the FOTD web 
; site in around 1 minute via dial-up, and in a few seconds via 
; broadband.  The FOTD web site may be accessed at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A sunny day with a temperature of 46F 8C here at Old Fractal 
; Central on Tuesday was just what the fractal cats had been 
; waiting for.  They spent the better part of the afternoon in the 
; holly thicket, doing nothing in particular.  The situation with 
; me was quite different.  I had plenty enough work to keep me 
; busy.  Unless the unexpected happens, which it has been doing 
; all too frequently lately, the next FOTD will be ready in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and be of stout heart but low 
; cholesterol.
