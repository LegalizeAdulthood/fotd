; FOTD -- December 17, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal reminds me of a school of sting rays circling 
; about in their feeding grounds.  (If sting rays do actually 
; circle and feed in schools, that is.)  I accordingly named the 
; image "Sting Ray Playground".  As for the rating, I decided on a 
; 6.  The image is a little better than average, but not by much.
; 
; The parent fractal, which was generated by combining 6.6 parts 
; of Z^(0.08) with 0.6 part of Z^(1.9) and adding C, appears as a 
; large squashed Mandelbrot set surrounded by satellite smaller 
; M-sets.  One of these smaller sets lying to the west of the main 
; set is of a quite unusual shape.  Today's image is located in a 
; valley of this unusually-shaped figure.
; 
; The image is unusual in that many of its features are due to the 
; colors.  Changing the color palette will make this quite 
; obvious.  The render time of under 7 minutes is a bit slow.  I 
; recommend visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the image there.
; 
; Saturday was slightly cooler but still pleasant here at Fractal 
; Central.  A high temperature of 50F 10C in the middle of 
; December is always welcome.  The fractal cats spent most of the 
; day watching a small hole in a corner of the kitchen.  I suspect 
; a mouse, but I have not yet seen one.
; 
; My day was rather hectic with excess shopping.  But I survived 
; somehow. The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and be in tune with the infinite.
