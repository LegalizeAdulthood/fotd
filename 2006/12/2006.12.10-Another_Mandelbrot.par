; FOTD -- December 11, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'm back at Old Fractal central for a stay of a day or two.  
; Despite the different location, I still managed to find a 
; fractal.
; 
; The image is a very quick one that I found in our old friend the 
; Mandelbrot set in less than 5 minutes.  It is located in a 
; remote valley of the large radical on the northwest shore of the 
; main bay.
; 
; There is not much to be said about the image, which pretty much 
; speaks for itself, at least for those with eyes to hear.  Since 
; it is so mundane, I gave it no rating.  And the name "Another 
; Mandelbrot" is self explanatory.
; 
; The exceedingly fast render time of 49 seconds is true on the 
; ancient P133 machine here at Old Fractal Central.  On my usual 
; machine back at New Fractal Central, today's image would calcu-
; late in about 30 seconds.
; 
; But regardless of the speed of calculation, the finished GIF 
; image is posted on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; ready for viewing.
; 
; A perfectly delightful sunny December day with a temperature of 
; 55F 13C here at Old Fractal central was fully appreciated by the 
; old fractal cats, Thomas and Tippy, who spent the entire after-
; noon sleeping in the holly thicket.  When the time arrived to 
; come inside, they were fully ready to enjoy their tuna.
; 
; My day back here at Old Fractal Central would have been more 
; enjoyable if it were not for my bum ankle, which is still slowly 
; recovering, and still has me slowed down to a hobble on flat 
; surfaces only.  I'll be here again tomorrow before heading back 
; to New Fractal Central and work on Tuesday.  The next FOTD will 
; appear right here in 24 or so hours.  Until then, take care, and 
; might might not always make right.
