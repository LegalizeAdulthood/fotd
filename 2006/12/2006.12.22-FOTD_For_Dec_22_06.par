; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal image was created when 10 parts of Z^(0.1) were 
; added to Z^(1.5).  The parent fractal is a fairly conventional 
; Mandelbrot set rotated about 45 degrees.  Some of it is missing 
; however.  The large period-2 bud is totally obliterated, along 
; with much of the southwestern shoreline of the large bay.  The 
; northeast part of the set is fairly intact however, and today's 
; image is located in some debris flung off from the northeastern 
; period-5 radical.
; 
; The image was done in an entirely conventional manner, with the 
; inside set to the number zero and the outside set to the itera-
; tion count.  The unusual effect is entirely due to the coloring 
; and the naturally odd shapes of the iteration bands.
; 
; Not overly impressed by the final result, I gave the image 
; neither name nor rating.  But it is worth at least a brief look, 
; and its calculation time of just over 1 minute is probably 
; faster than the time required to view the completed image on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Thursday started with light rain here at Fractal Central, but by 
; noon the rain had ended and the sun appeared.  The temperature 
; reached a relatively mild 45F 7C.  The fractal cats spent the 
; day inside, batting around ornaments they knocked off the deco-
; rated tree.  Cats who do not go outside do not worry themselves 
; about the weather.
; 
; My day was rather busy, mostly with seasonal stuff.  The next 
; FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be 
; lucky.
