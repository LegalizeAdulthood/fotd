; FOTD -- December 05, 2006 (Not Rated)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the Mandelbrot set, where we examine 
; the perturbed set with a starting point of 0.7-0.2i.  (The 
; starting point is actually the square root of 0.7-0.2i, but for 
; some reason, the type=mandel formula calculates the square root 
; of the coordinates of the entered starting point.)
; 
; I named the image "Baby Ghost Buds" for obvious reasons.  The 
; ghostly buds in the background, partly obscured by a giant 
; spiral, are quite obvious.  These buds are formed because, 
; regardless of where a point starts, its travels will always 
; eventually take it to the same path as a point that started at 
; 0,0.
; 
; Since the Mandelbrot set is very well explored, and I have 
; posted similar fractals several times, I gave today's image no 
; rating.  The calculation time of over 9 minutes can be cut by 
; 1/3 by rendering the image with the passes set to g.  The time 
; can be cut much further by going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the image there.
; 
; Partly cloudy skies and a temperature of 32F 0C made things a 
; bit too chilly here at Fractal central on Monday, especially 
; when combined with a brisk wind straight from the northwest.  
; The fractal cats endured the chill stretched by the radiator.  
; Their lazy day seems to have affected their appetites.  I 
; noticed a definite lack of enthusiasm when treat time arrived.
; 
; My day was slightly busy, whatever that is, but I finished the 
; real work in time to explore the perturbed Mandelbrot sets.  The 
; next FOTD will appear in 24 hours, almost guaranteed to be an 
; improvement over today's.  Until then, take care, and look for 
; the fractal lining.
