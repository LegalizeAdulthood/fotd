; FOTD -- December 02, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image was created by combining Z^100000 with Z^0.1 and 
; adding C.  It is named "Olympic Fractal".  The reason for the 
; name is not apparent from the appearance of today's image.  The 
; unlikely name was totally inspired by the parent fractal.
; 
; This parent fractal consists of several narrow, overlapping 
; rings, which I suspect are mathematical artifacts of some sort.  
; But made of artifacts or not, the parent reminds me quite 
; strongly of the five overlapping rings of the Olympic logo, 
; which is why I gave today's fractal image its name.  The image 
; is located on the edge of one of the rings, very near the 
; X-axis.
; 
; After a not-so-careful consideration, I rated the image at a 7, 
; which is a notable comedown from the rating of Nov. 30th's lofty 
; image, but still well worth the tiny effort required to view it. 
; The lightning-fast calculation time of 57 seconds means that the 
; image can be finished faster than one can go to the next room to 
; pour a drink.
; 
; Perhaps the most convenient way to see the scene is to visit the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the completed fractal there.
; 
; Heavy clouds, high winds and torrential thunder-showers passed 
; through Fractal Central on Friday, while the temperature reached 
; an unprecedented 75F 24C.  Unlike the old fractal cats, named 
; Thomas and Tippy; the new fractal cats, Nicholas and Cassie, do 
; not run and hide from thunder.  When the rain and wind arrived, 
; they leaped to the window to watch the excitement.
; 
; My day was about average, except for my walking ability, which 
; still has much improvement to make.  The next FOTD will appear 
; in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be content.
