; FOTD -- December 31, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's fractal image was created by an innocent formula that 
; subtracts 1.5 parts of Z^(-1.5) from 1.5 parts of Z^(1.5) then 
; adds C to create a parent fractal that lies beyond the southern 
; edge of the opening screen.  This parent fractal appears as a 
; small but fairly typical Mandelbrot set, with a rudimentary 
; M-set still farther south.  Countless smaller bits of fractal 
; bric-a-brac lie scattered around the scene.  Today's image is 
; located in the vague East Valley of the rudimentary M-set.
; 
; I named the picture "Last but not Least".  After all, today's 
; FOTD is the last one to appear in the year of 2006, and there 
; certainly have been lesser images during the past year.
; 
; After a moment or two of careful consideration, I rated the 
; image at a 7.  The 'tdis' inside outside option adds enough 
; oomph to the image to raise it to the 'above-average' category.  
; Actually, I was considering a rating of an 8, but could not 
; quite justify it.
; 
; The render time is a very speedy 2-1/4 minutes, which will save 
; precious computer time.  Even more precious time may be saved by 
; going to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the finished product there.
; 
; The day started cloudy, drizzly and chilly here at New Fractal 
; Central on Saturday, but by afternoon the clouds were swept away 
; by a southerly breeze, the sun appeared, and the temperature 
; shot up to 50F 10C.  Had the fractal cats been outside, they 
; would have enjoyed it, but someone found a left-over decorative 
; bow, and Nico spent the afternoon batting it around the living 
; room and chewing at it, while Cassie watched with curiosity.
; 
; My day was peaceful enough.  Now if only every day could be as 
; peaceful.  I am still somewhat slowed down by the ankle I sev-
; erely sprained over two months ago when I jumped from a chair 
; without looking and landed on a cat toy, but the worst of it is 
; over and I can now walk without aid, at least on a flat level 
; surface, though not yet at full speed.  Luckily, a full-speed 
; walk is not necessary to explore the virtual land of fractals, 
; which can be explored with a very minimum of physical effort.  
; The next in the long series of FOTD images and discussions will 
; appear in 24 hours.  BTW, the year 2007 will mark the tenth year 
; of the FOTD, which first appeared in April of 1997.  Until next 
; time, take care of yourself and be as happy as possible all year 
; long.
