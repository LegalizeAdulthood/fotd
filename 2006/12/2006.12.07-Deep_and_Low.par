; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's somewhat ominous image exists in the fractal that 
; results when the formula Z^1.1+C is calculated at a level 11 
; turns up the logarithmic ladder.  The escape radius of 1000 is 
; necessary because the parent fractal is so large that nothing 
; less will include all of it.
; 
; The midget at the center might more accurately be called a blob. 
; Its shapeless oval form holds little of interest.  But the 
; pattern around the midget is unexpectedly rich for a midget of 
; such a low order.  As is true of almost all midgets in this 
; range, the pattern consists of ominous dagger-like elements 
; thrusting toward the midget.  But these daggers are far more 
; varied than is usually the case.
; 
; I found the midget by calculating the parent fractal with the 
; outside set to 'fmod' and the logmap turned off.  The 'fmod' 
; feature makes finding midgets in such low-order fractals quite 
; simple.
; 
; At first, I was going to give the image no rating, but on second 
; thought, I decided it was worth at least a modestly worthwhile 
; 6.  The name "Deep and Low" has no special significance.  It 
; simply refers to the mood of the image.
; 
; With a fast render time of a little over 3 minutes, the included 
; parameter file will try the patience of few.  Even better news 
; is that the finished image is ready for immediate viewing on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Partly cloudy skies, snow flurries, and a temperature of 34F 1C 
; here at Fractal central on Thursday, made things a bit brisk for 
; outdoor activity.  The fractal cats never go outdoors however, 
; and they were quite happy alternating between playing, watching 
; from the window, and asking for their treat.
; 
; My day was adequate, which is all that can be said for it.  
; Tomorrow will probably be another adequate day with another 
; adequate fractal.  Until then, take care, and be of good cheer 
; for the rest of the year.
