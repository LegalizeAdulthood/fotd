; FOTD -- December 03, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The parent of today's image was created by combining 10 parts of 
; Z^(-2.1) with Z^(-10.5) and adding (1/C).  It appears as a large 
; flat disk with the fractal action on the southwest side.  
; Today's scene is located in one of the stubby arms extending 
; from this area of action.
; 
; The image is not quite worth a rating, but if I had rated it, I 
; would have given it a rating around 5.  Its effect is due almost 
; entirely to the color palette, and not to any great fractal 
; discovery.
; 
; The name "Star of the Season" was inspired by the 8-pointed star 
; around the central midget.  Yes, I know that seasonal stars have 
; 5 or 6 points, not the 8 points we have in the image.  But what 
; the heck?  A star is a star, and real stars have no points at 
; all.
; 
; The calculation time of 1-1/2 minutes is thankfully fast.  The 
; minor task of calculating the image may be dispensed with 
; entirely by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the seasonal star there.
; 
; A mostly cloudy and blustery day with a temperature of 43F 6C 
; on Saturday was ignored by the fractal cats, who spent most of 
; the day on their shelf by the window, watching for birds.
; 
; My day was about as close to normal as it is possible to come.  
; This might seem dull, but when things get too hectic, a bit of 
; dulness is just what the doctor ordered.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and be serene but 
; alert.
