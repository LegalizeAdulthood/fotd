; FOTD -- January 14, 2006 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image reminds me of what things must have looked like on 
; that first Pentecost Sunday, when tongues of fire danced above 
; the heads of the apostles, who were cringing in a secluded room, 
; hoping for a sign from God.  I see no apostles in the image, but 
; in the lower half of the image I certainly do see quite a few of 
; what can only be tongues of fire.  These colorful flame-like 
; tongues inspired the name "Tongues of Fire".
; 
; The rating of a 5 seems fair enough for an image that was found 
; so quickly.  The scene is located in the same parent fractal 
; that held yesterday's scene.  It is located in a tiny island 
; between the two branches of a split-apart Seahorse Valley.  The 
; effect of flaming tongues in the bottom half of the image was 
; created by rendering the image with the outside set to 'real'.  
; The debris filled sky was achieved by setting the inside to 
; 'zmag'.
; 
; The render time of almost 20 minutes is a bit slow.  That time 
; may be saved by downloading the completed GIF image from the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy fog blanketed the area around Old Fractal Central most all 
; day Friday.  The temperature of 50F 10C was mild enough, but the 
; misty atmosphere kept the grass a bit too wet for pleasant out-
; side conditions.  The fractal cats spent the day lounging on 
; their window shelf.  My day was spent finishing a bit of overdue 
; work.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, cling 
; to the old and embrace the new.
