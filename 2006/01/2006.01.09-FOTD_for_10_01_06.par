; 
; FOTD -- January 10, 2006 (NO RATING)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; A minor backlog of work makes today's discussion necessarily 
; brief.
; 
; Today's unrated fractal resulted when I subtracted Z^(-1.5) from 
; Z^(1.5) and added (1/C).  I rendered the scene with the outside 
; set to 'real', which adds a bit of action to an otherwise flat 
; image.
; 
; It would hardly be fair to rate an image that I found and 
; colored in less than 10 minutes.  It would also be unfair to 
; give a name to such an image.  But it is quite fair to state 
; that the image renders in less than 9 minutes, which, for those 
; who are dis-satisfied with the result, will keep the wasted time 
; within reasonable limits.
; 
; But no time at all will be wasted by visiting the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the finished GIF image from there.
; 
; The search for a new fractal central went well over the weekend. 
; If things work out, we will be moving to Sunbury, Pennsylvania 
; by April.  The city at the fork of the Susquehanna River has 
; seen better days, but the prices are right, and since we do most 
; of our work on the internet, we will not need to find employment 
; there.  The new F.C. is a huge rambling victorian house with 
; more nooks and crannies than one could explore in half a life-
; time -- exactly what fractal lady and I have always wanted.  
; But, as I said, all this is if things work out.  We are still 
; waiting word that our offer has been accepted.
; 
; Meanwhile, back here at the old fractal central, my sister took 
; good care of the fractal cats while we were away.  In fact, she 
; took too good care of them.  They were so full of tuna that they 
; barely touched Monday evening's serving.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and it will soon be 
; farewell forever to Bodymore Murderland.
