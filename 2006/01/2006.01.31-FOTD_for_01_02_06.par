; FOTD -- February 01, 2006 (Not Rated)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image shows a midget deep in the western shoreline of 
; the northern branch of Scepter Valley of the Mandelbrot set.  It 
; is neither named nor rated.  The only thing unusual about the 
; image is the nearly circular pattern surrounding the central 
; midget.
; 
; On my old 200mhz clunker, the image takes 24-1/2 minutes to 
; calculate.  My 2300mhz fireball unit finishes the image in just 
; over 1 minute -- a speed increase of 23 times.  Unfortunately, 
; the spectacular speed increase of the new unit is true only for 
; fractal types Mandelbrot and Julia.  (At least, I have found no 
; other fractal types with such a speed increase.)  The speed 
; increase of the type formula fractals is closer to a modest 4 
; times.  I suspect the types Mandelbrot and Julia use a specially 
; designed and very efficient routine.
; 
; The image may be seen by running the included parameter file or 
; by downloading the completed GIF file from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Rain in the morning and chilly winds in the afternoon here at 
; Old Fractal Central on Tuesday kept the fractal cat duo confined 
; indoors.  They showed less than the normal dis-satisfaction with 
; their confinement however, and had totally forgotten their bad 
; day by the time the evening treat of tuna was served.  My day 
; was another very busy one.  The next FOTD has an 81-percent 
; chance of being posted in 24 hours.  The philosophy will be on 
; hold until the New Fractal Central is established, which will 
; not be before the start of summer.
