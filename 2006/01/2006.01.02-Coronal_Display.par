; FOTD -- January 03, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I'm back . . . again!  And this time things are caught up enough 
; for me to feel reasonably confident there will be no further 
; interruptions to the steady flow of FOTD fractals for at least 
; two weeks . . . that is unless the unexpected happens.
; 
; When I opened my e-mail box yesterday for the first time in two 
; days, I was surprised by the number of spam letters offering 
; fake Rolex watches.  I was expecting a flood of impossibly cheap 
; mortgage offers.  What is it with Rolex watches?  What do they 
; do other than measure time?  Are they some kind of a status 
; symbol?  And why would I want a Rolex.  My 29-dollar digital 
; watch shows the time as accurately as a Rolex and wakes me up 
; with an annoying buzz.
; 
; I might not know much about the latest trends in watches, but 
; I'm reasonably hip about fractals.  Today's trip into iteration 
; land takes us to the ghost of the fractal generated when 0.2 
; negative parts of Z^(-4.2) are combined with negative Z^(-1.6) 
; and (1/C) is added.  This parent fractal is typical of fractals 
; generated by negative powers of Z.  It is grossly oversized, 
; with no organized shape at all.  The filaments extending from 
; the buds end in filament rings, with disconnected bits of debris 
; scattered inside these rings.  Today's scene is an evaporated 
; one, which means it consists totally of trapped 'inside' points. 
; It is located in one of these disconnected islands of chaos.
; 
; I named the image "Coronal Display" and rated it at a 6.  The 
; name came to me at random.  Considering the lack of effort, the 
; rating seems fair.
; 
; The quite brief render time of 1-1/2 minutes means that those 
; who are disappointed with today's image will have wasted little 
; computer time in calculating it.  Those who download the 
; completed GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; will have wasted almost no time at all.
; 
; On a minor philosophical note, a couple nights ago I watched a 
; TV program on which the rational skeptics once again debunked 
; the easy-to-debunk professional psychic fortune tellers who 
; dared to appear, pretty much proving to the skeptics' satisfac-
; tion that foretelling the future is impossible.
; 
; The skeptics' victory was hollow, for they had little competi-
; tion.  They merely demonstrated once again that professional 
; fortune tellers are about as accurate as would be expected by 
; chance.  They did not prove that getting hints of future events 
; is impossible.  (Such a proof is impossible!)  Nor did they 
; prove that it does not happen.  (It does happen!)  I know from 
; experience that not only is it possible for information to 
; travel backward in time, but sometimes it actually does happen, 
; and somehow it works its way into a person's awareness.  The 
; frustration is that I have no way of convincing skeptics of the 
; truth of precognition.
; 
; I suspect that the answer lies in the nature of time.  The 
; theory of relativity pretty much does away with the universal 
; sequential time that we take for granted in our everyday lives.  
; Such time is an illusion.  But what is really there?  What 
; permits hints of future events to travel into the past?  I will 
; have more to say about this topic in future philo-FOTD messages.
; 
; Wet days alternated with dry days here at the Old Fractal Cen-
; tral over the holiday.  The cats' moods varied as widely as the 
; weather.  Luckily, the supply of tuna held out.  In my depart-
; ent the work is almost caught up, though not yet quite there.  
; Another day will do the job.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and things are never so good that 
; they cannot get better.
