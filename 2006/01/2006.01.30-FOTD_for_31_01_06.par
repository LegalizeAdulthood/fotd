; FOTD -- January 31, 2006 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image continues the series of Z^(1.3)+C Julia sets.  It 
; is a Julia set of the Z^(1.3)+C Mandeloid as it appears 3 levels 
; up the spiral.  At this level, the Mandeloid holds a very large 
; midget off to the NW of the main bay.  Today's image is a Julia 
; set of the main bay area of this large midget.
; 
; Since I did put a bit of extra effort into coloring the image, I 
; gave it a rating of a lofty 8.  But I gave it no name.  Names 
; must be earned.
; 
; Much of the effect of the image is due to the inside parts, 
; which were rendered with the 'bof61' option.  The render time of 
; just over 2 minutes should test the patience of no one.  And the 
; image can always be enjoyed by visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Unsettled conditions here at Old Fractal Central on Sunday kept 
; the fractal cats undecided.  They went out several times, but 
; were soon faced with sprinkles of rain, which sent them scurry-
; ing for shelter.  Monday was far better.  My days continue very 
; busy.  The next FOTD, the first of the new month, will appear 
; with a probability of 88 percent in 24 hours.  Until next time, 
; take care, and don't ask how I determined the probability of 
; the next FOTD appearing in 24 hours.  I don't know how I did it.
