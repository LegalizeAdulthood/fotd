; FOTD -- January 29, 2006 (Not Rated)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; There will be no FOTD for January 30.  The next FOTD will be 
; posted on Tuesday, January 31. 
; 
; Today's image is a Julia set of the Z^(1.3)+C Mandeloid as it 
; appears 34.5 levels up the logarithmic hyperspiral.  The image 
; looks nothing like a proper Julia set however, filled as it is 
; with narrow converging discontinuities terminating in flat 
; circular disks, all this presented against a totally chaotic 
; background.
; 
; The corresponding Mandeloid is shaped vaguely like a classic 
; Mandelbrot set that has been rotated 180 degrees.  The point 
; that corresponds to today's Julia set is located in the broad 
; field of chaos on the west that passes for an east valley.
; 
; Putting so little work into the image, I could hardly give it 
; a name or rating.
; 
; The 6-1/2 minute render time should try the patience of very 
; few.
; 
; And as always, the completed GIF image is available on the 
; FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A near-perfect midwinter day with lots of sun, light winds and 
; a temperature of 63F 17C kept the fractal cats quite happy on 
; Saturday.  They were out of sight in the holly patch for over 
; two hours, but they came dashing in as soon as they heard the 
; rattle of the tuna can.  My day was quite busy, so busy in fact 
; that I will have no time to post a FOTD tomorrow.  The next FOTD 
; will therefore appear in 48 hours, which is two days from now.  
; Until then, take care, and look patient.
