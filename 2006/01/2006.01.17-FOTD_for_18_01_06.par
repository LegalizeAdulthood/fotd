; FOTD -- January 18, 2006 (NO RATING)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The hectic time here at OFC continues, and from the looks of 
; things, will get only worse.
; 
; Today's image shows a midget in the Z^1.3+C Mandeloid as it 
; appears one level up the complex logarithmic hyperspiral.  Since 
; I put virtually zero effort into the image, I have neither named 
; nor rated it.
; 
; All these low-order midgets have a similar appearance, kind of 
; like they were exploding.  In fact, I think one of the very 
; first FOTD's was an image of a low-order midget that I named 
; "Exploding Midget".
; 
; In today's particular scene, the passes=b option is the fastest, 
; and when it works, it is always the most interesting to watch in 
; action.  Of course, with an image that renders in only 2-3/4 
; minutes, the few seconds saved is of little consequence.
; 
; What is of consequence is the fact that the pre-rendered GIF 
; image has been posted to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; from where it may conveniently be downloaded.
; 
; Dry but cloudy and chilly weather prevailed all day Tuesday here 
; at Old Fractal Central.  The cats showed their displeasure by 
; passing the day sulking on their shelf.  The evening treat of 
; tuna cheered them somewhat.
; 
; For me it was a very busy day.  At this time I can give only a 
; 33-percent chance that I will have a chance to post a FOTD 
; tomorrow.  But check anyway.  A 1/3 chance is far better than a 
; zero chance.  Until next time, take care, and be ready for 
; anything.
