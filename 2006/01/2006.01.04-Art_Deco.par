; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The bad news has me feeling down and negatively philosophical 
; today, so the Fractint discussion will be brief.  I have said a 
; few more words in the philofractal version, but those words are 
; rather pessimistic.
; 
; Today's fractal is another average one.  As such it deserves 
; average treatment and an average rating.  The parent fractal was 
; created by combining negative portions of Z and (1/Z), and 
; adding (1/C).  There is no logical reason for the name "Art 
; Deco".  It simply came to mind.
; 
; The render time of 4-3/4 minutes is a bit slow for a fractal of 
; merely average quality.  Luckily, or perhaps unluckily, the com-
; pleted GIF image, ready for download, has been posted to the 
; FOTD web site at:

;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The fractal cats are much happier than people who worry about 
; fractals.  They do not concern themselves with the mysteries of 
; numbers.  They were busy enjoying their afternoon in the yard 
; on Wednesday.  Despite the clouds, the 46F 8C was warm enough 
; for them to enjoy over two hours outdoors.  By the time the 
; evening drizzle set in, they were safely inside.  My day was as 
; average as the fractal.  Hopefully, the next fractal will be 
; above average when it appears in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and dwell on the mystery.
