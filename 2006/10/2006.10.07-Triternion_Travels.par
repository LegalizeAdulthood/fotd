; FOTD -- October 07, 2006 (Not Rated)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The earlier version of today's FOTD will not run because I 
; left out the 'frm:' brfore the formula name.  This version 
; works all right.
; 
; Today's image makes use of a formula revised by Gilles Nadeau 
; and posted to the Fractint list on Friday.  (I have changed the 
; space between Neo and T-set in the formula name to an under-
; score.  A space band in a formula name is not permitted.)  The 
; formula is designed to draw the three-dimensional triternion 
; Mandelbrot set.  It does this very well.  But I notice that the 
; images it draws are the same as those drawn by the type=quat 
; formula in Fractint, which claims to draw slices of a four-
; dimensional quaternion M-set, but which I have always suspected 
; actually draws slices of a circular three-dimensional object.
; 
; It is apparent that the three-dimensional object being sliced by 
; both formulas is the figure that is traced out when the M-set is 
; rotated around its X-axis.  The value I gave (p1) in today's 
; image is +0.64952, which is the Y-value of the prominent valley 
; of the large north bud of the M-set.  And not surprisingly, the 
; valley appears in distorted form in today's image.  The large 
; open areas at the top and bottom of the frame are oblique slices 
; of the northern bud itself, or rather of the donut-shaped ring 
; this bud traces out as it rotates around the X-axis.  The chaos 
; across the middle of the frame is the fringe of the detail on 
; the main-bay side of the valley, grossly stretched as would be 
; expected when slicing through the edge of a donut.
; 
; What I would like to see is a way of rotating the slice 90 
; degrees, so that the circles of revolution are drawn, and also 
; the fascinating ovals that must lie in between.  I have no idea 
; of how to do this however.
; 
; The image is titled "Triternion Travels", which is a fair enough 
; opinion of the scene.  Since the image has mathematical value 
; but little artistic worth, I gave it no rating.  The render time 
; of 7-1/2 minutes on my 10-year-old machine may be avoided by 
; visiting the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and viewing the image as it is posted there.
; 
; A cloudy cool day here at Fractal Central on Friday went un-
; noticed by the dynamic duo of fractal cats, who still were more 
; interested in playing with each other and waiting for another 
; mouse to come out.  They exhausted themselves playing, and 
; showed little disappointment when no mouse appeared.  The usual 
; evening treat was fully enjoyed.
; 
; My day was totally average.  Tomorrow will probably be the same. 
; Until then, when the next FOTD will shine forth, take care, and 
; would the true number of dimensions that make up sub-atomic 
; reality please stand up.
