; FOTD -- October 11, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene on the negative X-axis of the 
; Z^(4.003)+C Mandeloid.  It is located in the East Valley area 
; of the large midget, which is the analog of the large midget at 
; -1.75 on the negative X-axis of the Z^(2.003)+C Mandeloid.
; 
; Here again we have features that remind me of a rail yard.  And 
; there are quartic midgets -- lots of them -- so many midgets in 
; fact that they come in clusters.
; 
; Today's image picks out one midget in a long string of similar 
; midgets.  Part of an adjoining midget is visible at the right 
; border of the frame.
; 
; I named the image "No Quartic Contest" and rated it at a 6.  I 
; had no good reason for choosing the name; the rating seems 
; appropriate.  The calculation time of 12 minutes is true on my 
; worn-out 10-year-old computer.  SOTA machines will finish the 
; task in a couple minutes or so.  But the fastest and easiest way 
; of all to see the image is to visit the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view it there.
; 
; The sun was bright, the wind was light, and the temperature 
; reached 75F 24C here at Fractal Central on Tuesday.  But the 
; weather went un-noticed by the fractal cats, who spent much of 
; the day racing up and down the long hallway, sliding around on 
; the carpets on the newly refinished floor.  We have decided to 
; let them have their fun until they grow tired of it.  They we'll 
; put rubber mats under the slippery carpets to hold them more 
; firmly in place.
; 
; The graphic work continued light.  I expect Wednesday to be the 
; same.  The next FOTD fractal will appear in 24 hours.  What it 
; will look like nobody knows.  Until then, take care, and be 
; ready to see something never before seen by human eyes.
