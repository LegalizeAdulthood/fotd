; FOTD -- October 17, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Do the herringbone patterns so prominent in recent FOTD fractals 
; exist in the odd planes of the Z^(2.0000001)+C Julibrot?  As 
; today's image shows, they most certainly do.
; 
; Today's image skices the Julibrot in the Oblate direction, which 
; is determined by the imag(c) and real(z) axes.  In this direc-
; tion, the scene remains pretty much intact.  The herringbones 
; remain where they should be, while the tiny hole still lies near 
; the center.  The slices in other odd orientations are far less 
; kind to the scene however, and distort things almost beyond 
; recognition.  I will show some of these other slices in upcoming 
; images.
; 
; I named today's image "Oblate Herringbone".  The name is little 
; more than a description of the scene.  Considering the image a 
; bit below the two previous herringbone images, I rated it at a 7.
; 
; The render time of just under 11 minuted may be avoided by 
; viewing the finished image from on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Increasing clouds and warmer temperatures here at New Fractal 
; Central on Monday went un-noticed by the fractal cats, who still 
; can not figure out why the carpets in the hallway no longer slip 
; so easily.  The big excitement of the day came when Nicholas 
; tried to dislodge Cassie from her favorite warm radiator cover.  
; He was rewarded for his effort by a swift hit on the top of the 
; head.  Luckily, all had been settled by the time evening snack 
; time arrived.
; 
; My day remained slow.  The big job that was originally due in 
; this morning has been delayed until Wednesday at the earliest.  
; Undoubtedly, it will still be needed on the original date.  The 
; next FOTD will shine forth in glory 24 hours from now.  The 
; glory will be in the eye of the beholder.  Until then, take 
; care, and where are all the scientific breakthroughs that were 
; supposed to be brought about by the space shuttle program?
