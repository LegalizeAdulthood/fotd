; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is more a curiosity than a work of art.  The name 
; "New Low Record" has nothing to do with the weather.  It refers 
; to the exponent of Z in today's fractal, 1.05, which is the new 
; low record.  I have never before found a midget in a Mandeloid 
; of such a low order.
; 
; And what do midgets in this range look like?  As today's image 
; shows, they look like little more than lopsided ovals centered 
; in a splash of total but semi-orderly chaos.  I chose a color 
; palette with very narrow and sometimes clashing color bands to 
; emphasize the confusion.
; 
; The question might arise as to how I manage to find the midgets 
; in such unpromising fractals as today's parent fractal.  To see 
; the difficulty, zoom out of today's image to a magnitude of 0.5 
; while keeping the same center coordinates, and see if any 
; visible sign exists that a midget might lie at the center of the 
; frame.  Nothing is there but waves of chaos.
; 
; But Fractint is very versatile, and has built into it a secret 
; method of finding hard-to-find midgets.  Take the hopeless 
; outzoom with its waves of chaos, change the 'outside' option 
; from 'iter' to 'fmod', with a proximity factor of 0.1, make sure 
; the 'logmap' is off, and re-calculate the hopeless image.
; 
; Surprise!  The location of the hidden midget is now indicated by 
; a bulls-eye.  Simply continue zooming into the center of the 
; bulls-eye until the midget is reached.  The location of other 
; hidden midgets lying nearby is also apparent.
; 
; These 'fmod' bulls-eyes do not always lead to midgets, sometimes 
; they lead to bottomless spirals, but they lead to midgets often 
; enough to make the 'fmod' outside option one of the most useful. 
; I must congratulate the one who thought of putting it into the 
; program.
; 
; The question arises of why I would want to find such chaotic 
; midgets in such low-order Mandeloids.  The reason is just for 
; the fun of seeing how low I can go.  My goal is to find a midget 
; in a Mandeloid with an exponent of Z less than 1.01, but that 
; might be impossible.
; 
; I could rate today's image no higher than an average 5.  It has 
; no center of attraction and only a vague overall theme.  The 
; elements near the shoreline of the midget sub-divide so rapidly 
; that they soon disintegrate into fractal sand.
; 
; The render time of 13 minutes is a bit slow.  But the image may 
; be viewed in its completed form on the FOTD web site in almost 
; no time.  The FOTD web site may be found at:

; 
; A partly cloudy and warmer day, with a temperature of 66F 19C, 
; here at New Fractal Central on Sunday went un-noticed by the 
; fractal cats, who spent most of the day staring and sniffing at 
; the hole in the floor by the radiator pipe, waiting for the 
; mouse to pop out again.  Unfortunately for them, the mouse is 
; now cat-wise, and is unlikely to show itself in such dangerous 
; territory.  When the evening treat time came, I wondered if the 
; cat duo might have preferred mouseburgers.
; 
; My day was as pleasant as things can be expected to be in this 
; far from perfect world.  The work is caught up, albeit temporar-
; ily, and the fractals are in no danger of running out.  The next 
; fractal will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and the 
; human eyes never see all that lies before us.
