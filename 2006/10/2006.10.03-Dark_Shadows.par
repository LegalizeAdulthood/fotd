; FOTD -- October 04, 2006 (Not Rated)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "Dark Shadows".  This is no tribute to 
; the old TV series that ended over 30 years ago.  It describes my 
; dark mood.  When bad things happen to good people, it gets me 
; mad.  I start wondering why.  Like most people, I do not like 
; meaninglessness.  And like quite a few others, I am becoming 
; ever more disappointed with a material-based science that is 
; helpless in the face of the big questions of life.  At the same 
; time, I am not so naive as to wonder why a God who is all-good 
; etc. permits the bad things to happen.  But I do wonder how it 
; was possible for the human mind to evolve such an instinctive 
; need for meaning if behind all the physical glitter there is 
; nothing but a meaningless random accident.
; 
; In recognition of my dark mood I have created a fractal that is 
; almost entirely darkness.  It resembles little more than a dew-
; sprinkled spider web glistening in the pre-dawn gloom, illumined 
; by the rays of a distant street light.
; 
; The image was created by combining Z^(-1.5) with Z^(-4.5) and 
; adding (1/C).  The somber color palette is an intentional 
; creation.  Since I intentionally made the image so gloomy, I 
; gave it no rating.
; 
; One bit of good news is that the render time of 1-1/2 minutes 
; will try the patience of no one.  And the task of rendering may 
; be avoided entirely by viewing the finished image on the FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A temperature of 79F 26C and partly cloudy skies went unappreci-
; ated by the fractal cats, who, because the mouse failed to 
; reappear, joined me in sulking.  The evening treat of cheese and 
; tuna only partly eased their disappointment.
; 
; Except for the bad news on the TV, my day was fairly routine.  
; If all goes well and tomorrow is a repeat, the next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and don't be a 
; gloomster.
