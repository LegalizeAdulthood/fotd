; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is titled "Evaporated Fractal".  An evaporated 
; fractal is just that -- evaporated.  Fractals will evaporate 
; when all the exponents of Z in their formula are negative and 
; the escape radius is raised to an extreme value such as the 
; 10^100 of today's image.
; 
; When fractals evaporate, their 'outside' parts shrink and 
; eventually disappear completely, leaving a blank screen 
; composed totally of 'inside' stuff.  But certain inside fills 
; such as the 'bof61' that I used in today's image can bring out 
; the ghost of the fractal that has evaporated.  Today's image is 
; such a ghost.  To see the un-evaporated version of the image, 
; change the imag(p3) parameter to zero.  The result is not quite 
; as interesting as the evaporated version, but it is still worth 
; a look.  None of the other inside fills do much with this 
; particular image.
; 
; I rated today's image at a 7.  I like something about the 
; coloring more than would seem apparent at first glance.  The 
; render time of 1-3/4 minutes will pass almost instantly.  If 
; this does not happen, go to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and view the image there.
; 
; Gray morning fog led to midday sun here at New Fractal Central 
; on Wednesday.  The temperature reached 79F 26C.  A very strong 
; thunder-storm moved in at 5pm, turning day to night, but the 
; fractal cats were more interested in the mouse hole than the 
; outside weather -- that is until I plugged the hole, when they 
; turned to me with a look of disappointment on their faces and 
; went on to other diversions.  Of course, plugging one hole will 
; never keep the mice out.  I am counting on the mouse that barely 
; escaped warning the others about the dangerous cat situation.
; 
; My day went as good as could be expected.  And the fractal was 
; not all that bad either.  The next fractal will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and ponder the imponderable.
