; FOTD -- October 03, 2006 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Yes, I know that today's FOTD is late.  As often happens in my 
; convenience-type business, an unexpected job came in on Monday 
; morning, which the customer needed the same evening.  The job 
; was small, and was indeed finished by evening, but this left 
; little time for fractals.
; 
; Despite the rush I did find one fractal with a bit of interest.  
; It appears as today's FOTD.  The image is a scene with a mini-
; brot, in the parent fractal that results when negative portions 
; of Z^(-1.6) and Z^(-4.7) are combined and (1/C) is added.  I 
; often use reciprocal C with fractals that contain negative 
; exponents of Z.  Such negative fractals are often inside-out.  
; Reciprocal C turns these fractals inside-out again, which makes 
; them rightside-out and easier to examine.
; 
; I enhanced today's image by calculating it with the 'outside' 
; set to 'tdis', but it is impossible to make much of little, so 
; with little to start with, I could rate the result no greater 
; than an average 5.
; 
; I named the image "Minibrot in Bloom" for no particular reason.  
; It is only fair that a merely average image be a fast one, and 
; with its render time of only 3 minutes, today's image is fast 
; enough.
; 
; The only faster way of viewing the less-than-glorious scene is 
; to take a virtual trip to the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and to download the completed image from there.
; 
; A morning with drifting patches of fog gave way to a sunny warm 
; afternoon with a temperature of 70F 21C here at New Fractal 
; Central on Monday.  The fractal cats glanced out the window a 
; few times, but spent most of the day waiting by the hole for the 
; mouse to come out and play.  They must play too rough, for the 
; mouse never appeared.  Their disappointment was eased in the 
; evening by a generous treat of tuna and cheese.
; 
; My day was unusually busy, but it looks like things will now be 
; normal for a week or two.  Unless I am wrong, which I sometimes 
; am, the next FOTD will appear in around 15 hours.  Until then, 
; take care, and walk in this world with puzzlement and enjoyment.
