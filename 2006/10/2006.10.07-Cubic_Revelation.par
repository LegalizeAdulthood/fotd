; FOTD -- October 08, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's unusually slow image takes us deep into the southern 
; shore of the west branch of the north valley of the cubic 
; Mandelbrot set.  This valley is the analog of Seahorse Valley of 
; the classic quadratic Mandelbrot set, though the elements are 
; arranged in powers of 3 rather than powers of 2.
; 
; The image is very slow because of the unusually high maxiter of 
; one-million.  Such a value seems excessive, but it is necessary 
; to fully resolve the cubic midget at the center.
; 
; I named the image "Cubic Revelation" because I was surprised at 
; the detail lurking in the valleys of the cubic M-set.  The 
; rating of a 7 seems appropriate for such a surprising fractal.
; 
; The downside is the render time, which is almost 2 hours on my 
; tired old warhorse computer.  A SOTA machine will calculate the 
; image in under 1 hour, but I still recommend saving time and 
; energy by downloading the finished image from the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Cloudy chilly weather here at Fractal Central on Saturday did 
; not annoy the fractal cats, who have discovered that the task of 
; a cat in a human world is chasing and catching mice.  But mice 
; are survivors, and in the mouse community word of dangerous cats 
; gets around fast.  No mice dared show themselves in Fractal 
; Central.  The cats ended the day by the radiator, washing their 
; faces after their evening meal.  The only mice they caught were 
; in their dreams.  (Cats do dream, but they never reveal what 
; they dream about.)
; 
; My day was uneventful.  The work continues at a leisurely pace, 
; but signs are on the horizon that a big job might be in the 
; works in about 10 days.  I'll keep this in mind as I wander 
; through Fractal Land during the coming week.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours or so.  Until then, take care, and be some-
; times puzzled.
