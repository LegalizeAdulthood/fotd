; FOTD -- October 09, 2006 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Most elements of the cubic Mandeloid are extensions of similar 
; elements in the classic Mandelbrot set.  They bear a strong 
; resemblance to their analogs.  East Valley of the M-set is 
; reflected in the prominent east and west valleys of the cubic 
; set.  Seahorse Valley is reflected in the valleys leading to the 
; prominent north and south double-buds of the cubic set.  But the 
; cubic Mandeloid has one set of valleys that is entirely new, 
; bearing no resemblance to anything in the classic M-set.  These 
; valleys are the ones that split the buds into two parts.
; 
; Today's image is a scene deep in the valley centered on the 
; Y-axis, which splits the north bud.  This valley has no corre-
; sponding feature in the Mandelbrot set and holds elements that 
; are entirely new.  I named the image "A New Valley" for this 
; very reason.
; 
; The rating of an average 5 indicates that I am not fully 
; satisfied with the results of the day's fractal efforts.  The 
; colors seem muddy, or it could be that my ancient monitor needs 
; replacing.
; 
; The render time of 25 minutes is borderline slow, though not 
; nearly as slow as some recent images.  But the task of rendering 
; the scene may be escaped by going to the FOTD web site and 
; viewing the image there.  The web site may be accessed at:

; 
; An absolutely perfect day here at New Fractal Central on Sunday 
; was ignored by the fractal cats, who spent most of the day 
; dashing up and down the hallway.  The brilliant sun and tempera-
; ture of 72F 22C had no effect on the duo.
; 
; My day was peaceful.  With any luck, things will stay that way.  
; The next FOTD, hopefully an improved one, will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and be quiet as a mouse hiding 
; from a cat.
