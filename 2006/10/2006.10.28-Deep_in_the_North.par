; FOTD -- October 29, 2006 (No Rating)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image takes us to the tip of the filament at the 
; northern extremity of the Mandelbrot set, where we examine a 
; midget on a side-filament radiating from a larger filament.
; 
; The normally humdrum image reached FOTD status when the 
; unusually attractive color palette rotated into view.  The image 
; looks best when the screen brightness is turned down.  I named 
; the image "Deep in the North" because it lies near the northern 
; extremity of the M-set.  I gave it no rating.
; 
; The render time of 15-1/2 minutes is quite reasonable for an 
; image with a magnitude of 10^24.  And the image may also be seen 
; on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The weather has been pretty much cloudy and chilly here at New 
; Fractal Central for the past few days.  But the cats didn't seem 
; to care.  I asked both of them who left the toy where I would 
; land on it and turn my ankle, but both claimed innocence.  No 
; problem.  I have already forgiven whoever did it.  It was really 
; my fault.  I should have looked before I leaped.  Being laid up, 
; hopping like a bunny, isn't much fun, but every now and then my 
; mood cheers up enough for me to do an FOTD.  If all goes well, 
; the next fractal will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take 
; care, and all bad times eventually pass.
