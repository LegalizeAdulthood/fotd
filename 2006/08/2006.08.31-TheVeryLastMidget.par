; FOTD -- September 01, 2006 (Not Rated)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is named "The Very Last Midget".  No, it is not 
; the last midget I will ever find, but it is the last midget that 
; will appear in a FOTD for the rest of September.  In fact, 
; today's image with its midget was originally scheduled to be 
; posted on August 31, but a heavy load of work prevented me from 
; posting it on schedule.  Tomorrow's FOTD, and those for the rest 
; of the month, will hold no midget.
; 
; Today's scene is located in the oversized fractal that results 
; when Z^(1.7) is subtracted from 1/10 part of Z^(-1.7) and (1/C) 
; is added.  Since I do not think too much of the image, I did not 
; bother giving it a rating.  But it is still worth a quick look, 
; especially if that look is on the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; where the image can be found, ready for easy download.
; 
; Crop circles and fractals -- an interesting combination.  My 
; opinion is that most crop circles are created by clever human 
; pranksters, but like with UFO's there is a small but puzzling 
; residue of unexplained circles.  Are the unexplained circles 
; caused by visitors from space?  Most likely not.  Are they 
; caused by supernatural forces?  Probably not.  Are they caused 
; by as yet undiscovered natural forces of earth?  Probably so.  
; But whether crop circles are real or fake, in my opinion, there 
; are far more interesting and mysterious things that exist in the 
; ultra-large realms of the cosmos and the ultra-small world of 
; the atoms.
; 
; A cloudy somewhat chilly day here at New Fractal Central on 
; Thursday went un-noticed by the new fractal cats, who spent the 
; day looking for and finding trouble.  Nico somehow got himself 
; shut up in the coat closet this evening, where he spent about 
; two hours.  When we noticed him missing and checked the closet, 
; he strolled out, looking at us as if to ask, "what took you so 
; long?"  Cassie watched with interest, wondering what all the 
; excitement was about.
; 
; My day was quite busy, but the work is nearly caught up, which 
; means the next FOTD should appear on schedule in 24 hours.  
; Until then, take care, and could crop circles actually be the 
; physical manifestation of fractals?
