; FOTD -- August 30, 2006 (Rating 5)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; In today's image we check another midget of a very low order.  
; The parent fractal is the Mandeloid that results when the 
; expression Z^(1.1892)+C is calculated 49 turns down the 
; logarithmic ladder.
; 
; The central midget might be the last one for quite some time.  
; I have a theme planned for the September FOTD's and midgets are 
; not included.
; 
; The rating of a 5 is all I could do for today's image, which 
; mostly repeats things we have seen many times before.  But one 
; thing that has not been seen so many times is the huge discon-
; tinuity in the pattern surrounding the midget, one of the 
; greatest I have yet seen.
; 
; I named the image "Off on a Tangent".  There is no logical 
; reason for such a name.  I simply felt like giving the image 
; that name.
; 
; The render time of 7 minutes is true on my 10-year-old fractal-
; dedicated P200 unit.  On the current SOTA (State Of The Art) 
; machines, the image will calculate in about 2 minutes.  But some 
; SOTA machines are over-qualified to run Fractint, which is still 
; the world's best fractal generator.  To avoid fractal frustra-
; tion, the owners of these handicapped units will need to down-
; load the finished GIF image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; A warm, muggy, lazy afternoon with a temperature of 86F 30C was 
; interrupted by a heavy thunder-shower at 4pm.  The new fractal 
; cats went to the window long enough to see what all the outside 
; commotion was about.  Then they returned to their job of getting 
; into trouble.  My sister called from Old Fractal Central this 
; morning to let me know that the old fractal cats, Thomas and 
; Tippy, are in good health, and are doing the same things they 
; did when we were there
; 
; My day was slow, but in the evening we heard from a customer who 
; informed us that he will send in a big job tomorrow morning.  
; The rush might put tomorrow's FOTD in doubt, so be sure to check 
; back here in 24 hours to see how it goes.  Until tomorrow, or 
; maybe the next day, take care, and life is the world's greatest 
; mystery.
