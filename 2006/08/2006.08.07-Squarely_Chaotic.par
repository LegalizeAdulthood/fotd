; FOTD -- August 07, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's image is a scene in the Z^sqrt(2)+C fractal as it 
; appears 41 levels up the logarithmic ladder.  (The ladder is 
; infinite.  Regardless of how far one climbs up or down it, they 
; can come no closer to the top or bottom, for there is no top or 
; bottom.)
; 
; I named the image "Squarely Chaotic" because the exponent of Z 
; is the square root of 2.  I rated the image a 6 because I could 
; find nothing in it that might earn a higher rating.
; 
; The parent fractal consists of a large double-lobed bay vaguely 
; resembling a termite and surrounded by considerable chaos.  
; Since termites are bad news if they get into the house, I left 
; the word out of the name.  Today's scene is located at the 
; inland edge of the chaos on the north-northeast shoreline of the 
; bay.
; 
; The image is not the best of all time, but the brief render time 
; of 1-1/2 minutes means that not much effort will have been 
; wasted if the image fails to please its viewer.  And as always, 
; the finished GIF image will soon be posted to the venerable FOTD 
; web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Another very pleasant day prevailed Sunday here at New Fractal 
; Central on Sunday.  The all-new fractal cats made the most of 
; things by watching birds and squirrels, and stretching in the 
; sun that comes in the front window during the afternoon.  In 
; the evening I gave them their treat of tuna, but Nicholas seems 
; to prefer cheese (sharp cheddar only) to tuna.  Maybe he was a 
; cow in a past life.  Cassie is satisfied with her tuna treat.
; 
; My day was peaceful enough, but Mindspring still does not have 
; its dial-up access under control in this area.  I guess it's 
; about time to think of a switch.  The next FOTD is due in 15 
; hours.  Until then, take care, and walk on the enlightened side 
; of the fractal.
