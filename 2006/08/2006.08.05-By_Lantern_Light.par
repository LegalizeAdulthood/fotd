; FOTD -- August 06, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; As promised, today's image is a scene in the same parent fractal 
; that held yesterday's image.  This fractal has a large chaotic 
; area located to the south and west of the main figure 8. The 
; midget at the center of today's image lies rather deep in the 
; East Valley of a larger midget which lies in the southwest chaos 
; of the parent fractal.  The East Valley nature of the scene is 
; immediately apparent, even though it is partly obscured by the 
; intricacies of the chaos in which it lies.
; 
; Much of the decoration is a result of a bit of extra effort I 
; put into the coloring.  This extra effort paid off when I rated 
; the image at a 7, a full point higher than the scene itself 
; deserves.
; 
; I can give no rational reason for the name I bestowed on the 
; image -- "By Lantern Light".  I guess I just happened to be 
; thinking of an old-time lamp-lighter when I thought of the name.
; 
; Nor can I give a rational reason why the image is so slow.  The 
; 1-1/4 hour calculation time is far out of proportion to the 
; difficulty of the scene.  An image with a magnitude of a mere 
; 3e+007 and a maxiter of only 7200 should render in around 10 
; minutes, not 75 minutes.  But fret not, for I have sent the 
; completed image on ahead to Paul at the FOTD web site, where it 
; will shortly be posted, ready for a minute or two download.  The 
; FOTD web site may ne accessed at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Well, the suggestion of Jim McKenzie has had an effect.  The 
; drop of oil delivered through a straw to the bearings of the 
; balky exhaust fan in the fractal computer has worked a temporary 
; fix.  The fan has been running for 4-1/2 hours without stalling 
; once.  It isn't exactly as quiet as when it was new, but it is 
; doing its job of cooling the CPU.  When the first drop wears 
; off, I'll add a second drop.  The tired old fractal computer may 
; have a few years of life left in it after all.
; 
; The absolutely perfect weather here at Fractal Central on Satur-
; day was appreciated from the window by the new fractal cats, who 
; spent most of the day gazing out at the sun, trees and birds, as 
; well as at an occasional squirrel, all the while wishing they 
; were strong enough to go out and chase things like the other 
; cats that they occasionally see pass by.  Unfortunately, we have 
; not yet decided to let them become inside-outside cats.  Maybe 
; we never will.  If not, the duo will never know what they have 
; missed.
; 
; My day was not quite as busy as expected, which left time for 
; today's rather slow fractal.  The next FOTD will appear in 24 
; hours.  Until then, take it easy and don't be caught without a 
; spare fractal.
