; FOTD -- August 23, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The big job went out on schedule this morning, and the customer 
; is happy.  The most recent rush has ended and the FOTD has 
; returned.  I would like to guarantee that this interruption will 
; be the last in the FOTD series of images and discussions, but I 
; have not yet learned to see the future.
; 
; To celebrate the re-appearance of the FOTD we have gone to the 
; fractal that results when Z^(-1.5) is subtracted from Z^(1.5) 
; before (1/C) is added.  This fractal is little more than a 
; single small Mandeloid surrounded by scattered bits and pieces 
; of fractal debris.  Today's image is located in a rudimentary 
; valley of one of these tiny bits.
; 
; I rated the image at a 6, though I could easily have chosen a 
; rating of 7.  I settled on the 6 because much of the image's 
; effect was achieved by rendering the scene with the outside set 
; to 'fmod'.  The basic scene is really quite bland.
; 
; I named the image "Garden of Rings".  The rings were created by 
; the 'fmod' option, which draws a series of overlapping bands and 
; rings, usually centered on points of interest.  This option is 
; also the simplest way to find hidden midgets, especially in the 
; Mandeloids with exponents of Z between 1 and 2.
; 
; IMO, the render time of 6-1/2 minutes is reasonable enough, but 
; individual opinions of what is reasonable may vary, so in addi-
; tion to rendering the image from the included parameter file, 
; the image may be seen by downloading it from the FOTD web site 
; at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; My philosophical ideas are taking shape, but are not quite ready 
; to be made public.  After all, radical ideas demand radical 
; thought and preparation.
; 
; Very pleasant but very dry weather continued all day Tuesday 
; here at New Fractal Central.  Conditions are approaching drought 
; status, but the new fractal cats did not even notice.  They 
; spent the day playing under an old afghan which I spread on the 
; living room floor for them.
; 
; My day was pretty much occupied with cleaning up after the big 
; rush of the past week or so.  Hopefully, such rush jobs will not 
; arrive too often, though I certainly do not want them to totally 
; vanish.  The next FOTD will arrive in 24 hours.  That is almost 
; but not quite guaranteed.  Until then, take care, and how would 
; it be possible to prove that the universe is not real?
