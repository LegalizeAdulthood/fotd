; FOTD -- August 08, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Today's FOTD image takes us to the fractal that is created when 
; various negative portions of Z^(-1.7) and Z^(-5.7) are combined 
; and (1/C) is added.  This parent fractal consists of a sprawling 
; area of filamentary threads and loops, with two large open Man-
; deloid bays.  Today's image lies in a valley of the smaller and 
; westernmost Mandeloid.
; 
; Judging by the pattern around the midget, the valley appears to 
; have a mixture of Seahorse and East Valley nature, with maybe a 
; slightly stronger East Valley nature.  But the brain-like 
; features usually associated with East Valley are anything but 
; brain like.  They look more like a carnival booth surrounded by 
; energetic lightning, or perhaps the brain of a super-genius.
; 
; The rating of a 7 seems about right for today's fractal.  The 
; name "In a Remote Valley" describes the location of the fractal 
; in its parent.  The render time of 7-1/3 minutes is brief enough 
; to avoid total boredom, but still long enough for hints of 
; impatience to arise.  These twinges of impatience may be avoided 
; by downloading the completed image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The absolutely perfect weather here at Fractal Central on Tues-
; day raised hopes in the fractal cats of going outdoors.  Unfortu-
; nately, those hopes were dashed and the duo had to settle for an 
; afternoon of playing with and finally wrecking the daily news-
; paper.  In the evening, Nicholas enjoyed his treat of New York 
; sharp cheddar cheese, which he prefers to tuna, while Cassie 
; satisfied herself with a simple dish of tuna.
; 
; Tuesday was uneventful in my department, though I expect the 
; next week or so to be quite busy.  So do not be surprised if the 
; FOTD for tomorrow fails to appear when it should.  In fact, we 
; might miss a couple FOTD's between now and August 16.  Until the 
; next time, take care, and the answer to the riddle of the uni-
; verse might be encoded in the depths of these fractals, if only 
; we had the eyes to see and recognize it.
