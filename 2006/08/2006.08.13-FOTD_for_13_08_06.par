; FOTD -- August 13, 2006  (Rating 4)
; 
; Fractal Visionaries and Enthusiasts:
; 
; The super rush continues here at Fractal Central.  This is the 
; kind of stuff that tempts me to retire from the over-manned and 
; under-appreciated world of graphic design to a leisurely life of 
; philosophizing and fractalizing.  Unfortunately, finding frac-
; tals does not pay nearly as well as designing and laying out 
; pages for printing, so I guess the retirement will have to wait 
; a while.
; 
; Today's image is another one I found almost with no effort.  As 
; such it rates a rating of a humble 4.  The parent fractal was 
; created by combining Z^(-1.5) with 0.3 part of Z^(-6.5) before 
; adding (1/C).  The only thing unusual with the image is that it 
; was calculated with the outside set to 'tdis' rather than the 
; more routine 'iter'.  Seeing nothing in it worthy of a name, I 
; gave the image no name.
; 
; The render time of 5-1/4 minutes is true on the venerable 
; 11-year-old P133 machine that was the business work-horse all 
; those years ago, when the previous 80486 unit was just learning 
; its fractals.  Those who do not render fractals may see the 
; image by visiting the FOTD web site, where it is posted.
; 
; The weather has been near perfect here at Fractal Central the 
; past two days.  Only a bit too much chill for mid August kept it 
; from being absolutely perfect.  The fractal cats delighted in 
; their indoor play and their food.  Not being permitted outside, 
; they remain unconcerned about the weather.  If the present trend 
; continues, the next FOTD, another mediocre one, will appear in 2 
; days.  Until then, take care, and if we have bodies, souls and 
; spirits, what are these mysterious "we's" that possess all these 
; things?
