; FOTD -- August 26, 2006 (Rating 7)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I see in the news that the planet Pluto has been demoted to the 
; ignominious status of a dwarf.  This means that what I learned 
; in school is no longer valid.  There are no longer nine planets 
; in the solar system, but only eight.  I should not be too upset 
; about learning the wrong thing however.  I also recall being 
; taught that Piltdown Man was the missing link, and the solar 
; system is a unique thing which formed when the gravity of a 
; passing star pulled blobs of material from the body of the sun.
; 
; I'm not sure what the astrologers, who need Pluto to make their 
; charts work, will do now that they have lost one of their 
; planets.  Maybe I'll check the internet to see what they make of 
; it.  My own view is that we might have lost a planet, but we have 
; gained the world of fractals.
; 
; Today's image would have remained forever undiscovered if I had 
; not calculated the fractal that results when Z^(1.1) is subtrac-
; ted from Z^(-1.1) and (C) is added.  The odds of this particular 
; scene ever seeing the light of day are infinitesimal, yet here 
; it is -- today's FOTD.
; 
; How could such an unlikely thing possibly have come to pass?  
; The answer of course is that there are an infinity of almost-
; impossible things that can happen in the world of fractals.  And 
; unless I am mistaken, which I often am, infinity multiplied by 
; an infinitesimal equals unity.
; 
; Today's image rates a 7, and it is worth it.  The scene was 
; rendered in the traditional manner, with outside=iter and 
; inside=0.  The unusually decorative effect is a natural part of 
; the scene, not a result of program trickery.  I named the image 
; "Total Reality" because it is totally real.
; 
; The render time of the included parameter file is just over 4 
; minutes, but the wait may be avoided by going to the FOTD web 
; site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; and downloading the completed GIF image from there.
; 
; The temperature on Friday reached only 82F 28C, but the day was 
; a bit too humid for perfection.  The fractal cats didn't mind 
; however.  Their big excitement came when Nico leaped onto the 
; table and knocked over a lamp.  We forgave him.  After all, it's 
; a cat's duty to get into trouble.  The day ended peacefully with 
; tuna and cheese in the cats' food dishes.
; 
; My day was reasonably relaxing.  The work was finished before 
; noon, leaving me with nothing to do in the afternoon but search 
; for fractals.  With only a few exceptions, nothing in the world 
; is more interesting than searching for fractals.  The next FOTD 
; will appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and for your 
; answers, look beneath the surface.
