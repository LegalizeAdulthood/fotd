; FOTD -- August 05, 2006 (Rating 6)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; The lateness of today's FOTD is due to a problem with Mind-
; spring, my ISP.  When the regular posting time arrived between 
; 11pm and midnight last evening, I could not get connected.  Oh 
; well, as they say, nobody's perfect, expecially internet 
; service providers.  Things are better this morning.  (I hope.)
; 
; Today's image shows one of the things that happens when 0.7 part 
; of the negative square rot of 2 is subtracted from 0.7 part of 
; the positive square root of 2.  Actually, an infinity of things 
; happen, but with limited time I can cover only one of them.  To 
; show that more than one thing happens, I will use the parent 
; fractal of today's image as the source of tomorrow's image.
; 
; The parent fractal resembles a grossly inflated and skewed 
; figure 8.  Today's scene is located in the vicinity of the east 
; branch of the valley that separates the north and south lobes 
; of the 8.  This area resembles an eroded shoreline filled with 
; Mandelbrot bays -- I think they are called radicals.  The tiny 
; midget at the center of today's image is located far out on a 
; filament extending from the center of one of these bays.
; 
; I have found that the overall nature of today's scene is quite 
; common in fractals which combine more than one power of Z, so I 
; could rate the image no higher than a 6.  Yes, in the world of 
; fractals, originality does count.
; 
; I named the image "Negative Thinking" because it deserves a 
; name.  I can give no good reason for the exact name, other than 
; a reaction to all the benefits of positive thinking we keep 
; hearing about.  Life is a mixture of good and bad events.  
; Positive thinking is getting as much enjoyment as possible from 
; the good things while minimizing the anger etc. from the bad 
; things.  Positive thinking sounds good in theory but it doesn't 
; seem to work very well in practice.  I suppose negative thinking 
; would be the opposite.  (Maybe negative thinking is what there 
; is too much of in the middle east.)
; 
; There is no problem with the render time of the included para-
; meter file, which is under 6 minutes, and this is on my ancient 
; fractal-dedicated computer with the exhaust fan that needs a 
; slice of tissue attached to blow in the wind so that I can tell 
; when the fan stops running and must be goosed to life again.
; 
; And running the included parameter file may be avoided entirely 
; by downloading the finished image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; The perfect weather here at Fractal Central on Friday went un-
; appreciated by the new fractal cats, who spent the day indoors, 
; chasing each other up and down the hallway, and getting into 
; various other mischief.  In my department, the work appears to 
; be getting heavy.  Hopefully, we will be able to keep it under 
; control.  The next FOTD is due to appear in 15 hours.  If it 
; fails to appear, you will know that the work was not kept under 
; control.  Until next time, take care, and when you need some 
; positive thinking, think of fractals.  I am positive they will 
; ease your distress, or at least make you think your distress 
; has been eased.
