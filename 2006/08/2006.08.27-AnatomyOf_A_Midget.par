; FOTD -- August 28, 2006 (Rating 8)
; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; I have always wondered what a midget in the Z^sqrt(2)+C fractal 
; looks like up close and personal.  Today I decided to find out.  
; I calculated the Z^sqrt(2)+C Mandeloid as it appears 414 levels 
; down the logarithmic ladder, and found the smallest midget I 
; could that was within range of resolution.  I set the maxiter at 
; a very high 50000 and let the image rip.  The unusually high 
; maxiter is necessary to show all the detail in the more chaotic 
; areas surrounding the main bay.
; 
; Surprisingly, or perhaps not so surprisingly, the midget mirrors 
; the appearance of its parent fractal.  The sharp, jagged 
; elements radiating from the midget have divided and sub-divided 
; until they have lost definition.  I would like to more closely 
; examine the chaotic areas of the image, but sadly, these lie 
; beyond resolution.
; 
; I named the image "Anatomy of a Midget".  After all, the picture 
; is basically a study of a midget.  I rated it at an 8, perhaps a 
; bit high but not beyond reason.
; 
; The render time of 27-1/2 minutes is true when the parameter 
; file is run on my fastest machine, a P4-2300, with the passes 
; set to 1.  On my usual P200 unit, the image takes about 1/1-2 
; hours, not nearly the 11-1/2 times as long as might be expected.
; 
; All this concern about render times may be avoided by download-
; ing the finished image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; Heavy rain fell all day Sunday here at New Fractal Central on 
; the banks of the Susquehanna River in Central Pennsylvania.  By 
; the time the day ended, near 4 inches, that is 10cm, of rain had 
; fallen, causing some flooding of small streams and streets.  The 
; fractal cats stopped chasing each other long enough to glance 
; out the window once or twice to watch the rain.  But they are 
; not outside cats, and they don't worry about wet weather.
; 
; My day started slow and finished slow.  The next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and what is more 
; unreal, a dream or a fractal?
