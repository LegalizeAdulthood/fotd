; 
; Fractal visionaries and enthusiasts:
; 
; Back in my naive teen-age years, when I was just becoming 
; familiar with the scientific world of astronomy, weather, and 
; atoms in particular, I often wondered what an atom looks like.  
; I soon formed a picture of the atom as a miniature solar system, 
; with electrons orbiting the nucleus like planets orbit their 
; stars.  The nucleus seemed to me to be a boiling mass of protons 
; and neutrons somewhat resembling a pot of boiling liquid.
; 
; It all made a kind of sense.  When a radioactive atom decayed, 
; it was because a proton had escaped the surface of the boiling 
; nuclear liquid.  I felt that if I could shrink myself small 
; enough, I could actually observe these atomic things taking 
; place.  I wondered whether atoms actually might be miniature 
; solar systems with galaxies, stars and planets, like in the 
; story about a shrinking man which I read about that time.
; 
; Then I started reading more serious books about the sub-atomic 
; world and the quantum.  I came to realize that whatever is 
; actually down there is so far removed from our everyday experi-
; ence that it can be best described only approximately by math-
; ematical expressions.  To attempt to picture a physical reality 
; corresponding to the quantum math is a futile endeavor.
; 
; I now know that protons and electrons are not 'things' in the 
; sense that tables and chairs are things.  They are ideas, mental 
; models that happen to work reasonably well.  In a sense, we 
; create them along with their attributes when we describe them.
; 
; This is well illustrated in the case of an electron, which is 
; said to be both a potential wave and a potential particle with a 
; spin of 1/2.  Such a spin means it would need to undergo two 
; complete 360-degree rotations before it would present the same 
; face to a hypothetical observer.  Unless an electron is some 
; kind of single-sided Mobius object, which must be turned 720 
; degrees before it returns to its original position, the elec-
; tron's attributes would appear to be impossible.
; 
; Electrons may appear impossible, but it would be interesting to 
; see what a person would observe if an electron were enlarged to 
; the size of a basketball.  Of course, if electrons are mere 
; points, enlargement is meaningless.
; 
; By contrast, fractals most certainly are not only possible, but 
; have actually been observed in full graphic representation.  
; Unfortunately, so far at least, fractals such as the Mandelbrot 
; set have been seen only as computer-generated photographs.
; 
; Today's photographic image of a fractal has been named "Atomic 
; Nucleus".  The central midget reminds me of a nucleus, while the 
; surrounding elements could be seen as electrons.  The image is a 
; scene in the parent fractal that results when Z^(-1.75) is 
; subtracted from Z^(1.75) and (1/C) is added.
; 
; In this case the parent fractal could more accurately be called 
; the parent debris field.  It is little more than a scattering of 
; fractal debris.  But that debris is filled with countless 
; midgets, one of which lies peacefully at the center of today's 
; frame.
; 
; The rating of a 6 seems appropriate.  Rendered as it is with the 
; outside set to 'iter', the image does look a bit under-detailed, 
; but in this case the under-detailed version is the best.  The 
; other outside options give so much detail that the result is 
; more chaos than fractal semi-order.
; 
; The image is a fast one, which renders in 2-1/2 minutes on my 
; P200 machine.  Equally brief if not briefer is the time spent 
; downloading the finished image from the FOTD web site at:
; 
;        <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>
; 
; What a waste!  We had another absolutely perfect day here at New 
; Fractal Central on Wednesday and the new fractal cats didn't 
; even care.  They spent the day chasing each other up and down 
; the hall and getting into other various and sundry trouble.  My 
; day was spent doing various odd jobs between the times I was 
; doing fractals.
; 
; If all goes well, and why should it not, the next FOTD will 
; appear in 24 hours.  Until then, take care, and don't be 
; nucular, be nuclear.
